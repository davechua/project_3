DATA: I have a question, sir. 
PICARD: Yes, Data. What is it? 
DATA: What is death? 
PICARD: Oh, is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the most difficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into an indestructible form, forever unchanging. They believe that the purpose of the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-like garden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity. On the other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinking into nothingness, with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely a delusion. 
DATA: Which do you believe, sir? 
PICARD: Considering the marvellous complexity of our universe, its clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter, energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence must be more than either of these philosophies. That what we are goes beyond Euclidian and other practical measuring systems and that our existence is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality.",startrek,Just a little appreciation for some of the dialogue in Str Trek TNG,1229,208,5.908653846153846

Aquareon,1618777817,mtksmo,4,1,"Trek has long been lauded for depicting a model of high-diversity cooperation between all races and aliens, but they're always roughly on the same level with respect to capabilities and growth potential, at least compared to Data or the EMH.   


Either, if they desired to and were allowed to do it, could grow themselves into something so far beyond their crewmates that continuing to serve in their original capacity would become unbearably stifling. TNG solves this by having Data idealize humanity &amp; strive to embody it. Ok but what if he didn't? What if he wanted to explore his potential?  


The EMH kind of pushes up against these boundaries in the S6E3 ""Virtuoso"" where he basically becomes Hatsune Miku to an entire species (the Qomar) which somehow never invented music. As the Qomar adore him, he initially wants to permanently leave the ship and live with them.   


The episode returns to the status quo by the end though, resolving the situation by having the  Qomar copy the Doctor with improvements to his vocal range which somehow are impossible without clearing up more space by deleting medical knowledge (a metaphor for giving up important parts of yourself for your career when you sell out) conveying the lesson that fame is fickle, friends are forever.   


However Janeway's reaction to the doctor leaving sounds like a plantation owner exasperated that her slave is unhappy despite letting him live in the house, take meals with the family, etc. She does not exhibit the same enlightened attitude that Picard had towards Data in The Measure of a Man. Is this just a personality difference? Is Janeway retrograde on the issue of AI rights? Or has something changed culturally in the federation between TNG and Voyager?   


The Doylist explanation imo is that infinite diversity in infinite combinations only works so long as nobody is severely different in terms of their raw capabilities. Whenever aliens exceed in one area (like Vulcan intelligence or strength) they fall short in some other area (creative thinking, interpersonal diplomacy). Thus there are differences, but everybody's somewhat balanced.  


That goes out the window if you have a single crew member with a 1 trillion IQ who can solve all of your problems. It's like S4E19 of TNG, ""The Nth Degree"". Barclay interfaces directly with the ship computer and in doing so expands his capabilities so far beyond all other crew that there was no way the writers would just let him stay like that. It would be like Roger Penrose trying to integrate himself into beaver society, stripping down, helping them move mud &amp; sticks to build a dam.  


I think the root of this was in Gene Roddenberry's aversion to human improvement. We see it in the Federation's prohibition against genetic engineering, slowing aging, cybernetic transhumanism (except where restorative, as with Geordi) and in this case aversion even to AI outgrowing humans. Everything is fine so long as it remains in the narrow little range where everybody can serve aboard starships together.   


To me that's contrived &amp; small minded. It ironically smells to me like jealousy &amp; fear of difference. Star Trek is supposed to philosophically promote the acceptance of differences but it only does so to a point, because too much difference breaks the paradigm.",startrek,Federation culture does not allow much room for growth if you're an AI,3328,545,6.106422018348624

I thought Star Trek was moving towards more dumbed down action and abandoning all of the cerebral nuance, philosophy, and ethics that made the franchise so intellectually stimulating. Come to find out, I was kinda right about that, but the later trek that I take issue with lacks the stylish yet faithful visuals, the clear respect for the characters, and the ability to tell a great story that reinvents a 50 year old franchise while keeping the spirit of what most people identify with. I've always loved the cast with the exception of Chris Pine as Kirk. When I was a kid and originally saw the movie, I didn't understand why all the characters seemed the same except for Kirk, but now I'm able to appreciate the immense writing talent it takes to rewrite a character that never had a father. A reckless, undisciplined Kirk that doesn't care for protocol or taking things seriously, although I don't care much for into darkness or beyond, I love how we got to see this kirk mature and grow into the kirk we've always known and loved. I also loved how they incorporated Leonard Nimoy and time travel in a way that made sense and didn't just seem like pointless fan service.

WaveMonkey,1618743242,mtamzp,12,1,"They get into situations that could easily be avoided and then they wonder why people get killed.  They don't send probes to scout ahead of the ship to look for hazards.  That would save them so much trouble.  They don't use drones or robots when beaming down to a hazardous location or onto a ship with hostile aliens.  When they encounter a crazy space anomaly they fly really close to it.  Instead of just sending a probe.  When they are told a region of space is super dangerous and that they should leave immediately they stay and investigate it.  This is what led to them running into the borg.  

And their biggest problem is they are extremely arrogant and don't seem to learn from their mistakes.  They try to impose their values on almost every other civilization they encounter.  Despite the prime directive.  Which would be fine if the prime directive didn't exist.  But it just makes them look like hypocrites.  They also use the prime directive as a shield to avoid getting their hands dirty when they don't want to help others.  Like when they turned their backs on the planet of drug addicts.  So as an organization they are arrogant with an ego the size of the sun and stupid.  

And the rigid military structure of starfleet makes it so they repeat the same mistakes and are slow to accept new ideas and new far less hazardous ways of doing things.  So they are extremely arrogant and because of it act like idiots.  And put themselves in unnecessary danger.  They try to maximize the risks of space travel.  Why else would they run so much power through consoles.  They could accomplish a lot by sending robots and holograms into dangerous situations (And by using them to maintain their ships).  But they send people instead.  These are supposed to be highly educated people but they make extremely stupid decisions on a regular basis.  And a lot of people end up getting killed because of it.  

And that's during times of peace.  When they're at war their incompetence and stupidity goes to insane levels.  Just look at the dominion war.  So starfleet as an organization is extremely egotistical and arrogant.  And hypocritical because they pick when they want to follow the prime directive and when they don't.  And they aren't consistent about it.  I think if they are going to have the prime directive their should be exceptions to it for things like planetary disasters.  But they violate the prime directive when they want to and use it as a shield when they don't want to get involved.  But they also talk about it like it's gospel.

ShaunLevi1995,1618740413,mta2gs,0,1,"So I just finished Season 2 and immediately picked up on where the writers were drawing their inspirations from.

The first half of the season starts off like *The Mothman Prophecies* from 2002 starring Richard Gere. In that film &gt;!a strange, mysterious winged creature/entity appears as a visual distortion backed by bright light to either signal doom or warn people of an upcoming catastrophe.  People who are a witness the creature/entity have dreams, nightmares and become obsessed and frantically create a series of disturbing drawings and sketches of how it appeared to them. !&lt;

This is pretty much what happens in Discovery S2 with Spock being a witness to the Red Angel, becoming obsessed with it and creating all these illustrations of it, even as an adult. 

The second half of the Disco's S2 becomes *The Terminator* or every sci-fi movie where the military/government trusts their A.I. to make all their tough decisions and protect them, only for it to be come self aware and threaten to destroy humanity. Control is pretty much Skynet and Gabrielle's travel to the future shows the aftereffects of Judgement Day. Michael and the Disco crew have to prevent that future from happening and fight Control controlled humans who act like Arnie's T-800, impervious to projectile fire, and able to take the appearance of anyone they come into contact with like the mimetic alloyed T-1000. Even shooting a hole through Leland just allows himself to reseal it just like the T-1000 does, or take form as a fast crawling fluid.  

The tail end of the season is *Iron-Man*. Gabrielle Burnham is revealed to be a Howard Stark-like inventor who creates an amazing powersource/power-suit. Michael is like Tony Stark, having to use her parent's tech to recreate a power-suit of her own to save the day. We even get visual call backs to the *Iron-Man* film with close-ups of Michael in the suit with the interface reflected onscreen, and the traditional superhero landing/take-off pose. 

I'm assuming that the Klingon home world stuff is supposed to be like *Game of Thrones* but since I haven't seen the HBO series I can't say for certain. The final battle reminded me of the CGI outer space battles of the *Star Wars* prequels. I think I even saw some droids repairing the Discovery at some point.

Vulcan telepathy seems like far more trouble than it's worth.

Many years ago, when I went to live in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on an exchange year and a half to improve my English, I started watching Star Trek. Before long, I had binged every series, bar TAS and TOS. Since then, I have been in love with the franchise. I like TNG and DS9 best, but also really enjoy VOY and ENT. 

I enjoyed Picard and Discovery, but they were missing something all other Star Trek shows had. 

A few months ago, I rewatched ENT in its entirety and had a blast. Then I moved on to VOY, and also really enjoyed it, though I didn‚Äôt finish season 7. I then started a watch-through of DS9, because it is one of my favourite series. However, a few episodes into season 2, I realised that I still remember every episode. It‚Äôs not time for a rewatch yet. And thus, I have begun a rewatch of TNG. I intend to watch every episode again. I just watched ‚ÄúEncounter at Farpoint‚Äù, and WOW! There‚Äôs a lot to work through! 

At first I thought ‚ÄúHey, some of the women wear skirts. Seems like we‚Äôre not yet that woke. Then I realised there were also a few men wearing skirts and I thought that was really funny! 

I completely forgot the plot of this episode, so I‚Äôm looking forward to the other episodes I forgot. Picard was kind of a dick in the first half of the two-parter. Generally, the first half of the two-parter was weird. Troi was way over-sensitive to emotions, Tasha was like a bouncer, Picard was a dick, Riker was the swot you laughed at in school and Data was way more robot than usual. 

However, after watching season one of DS9, four seasons of ENT and six and a half seasons of VOY recently, wow, this is different. You start, and you get this new captain on a luxurious ship, and all of a sudden, Q pops up and puts humanity on trial. What a start to this series. I love it!

bflaminio,1618697660,mt0c8b,9,1,"As we know, the runs of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), Deep Space Nine (DS9), and Voyager overlapped within the same timeframe. If one's intent is to watch them all, the viewer has several options:

* By release date -- this is the way we watched them fresh -- if you want to experience life in the 1990s, this may be for you.

* Chronologically -- the guys at the [Star Trek Chronology Project](https://thestartrekchronologyproject.blogspot.com/) have done a great job of putting together an order.

* Watch all of TNG, then all of DS9, then all of Voyager -- great if you dislike jumping around between series.

* Randomly; whatever happens to be on -- most of the episodes are reasonably self-contained, and so picking it up anywhere is not a bad thing.

I've been thinking of another alternative -- an order that preserves the chronology and avoids spoilers while not jumping around too much between series.

I've been bingeing *Stargate* recently, and this franchise likewise has series that overlap: SG-1 and Atlantis, with the same discussions about watching orders. In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/dllw8/the_official_rstargate_what_order_do_i_watch/c113muu/) u/rinnieangel puts forth such an order, and so far in my progress, it's pretty good. So, inspired by that and with u/GoldenSandslash15 's excellent notes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/mq7njk/interleaving_tng_ds9_vog_by_stardate/gueajr3/) I'll propose this watch order for the TNG/DS9/VOY run:

* TNG 1.01 - 6.11

* DS9 1.01 - 1.20

* TNG 6.12 - 7.01

* DS9 2.01 - 2.19

* TNG 7.02 - 7.20

* DS9 2.20 - 2.26

* TNG 7.21 - 7.26

* DS9 3.01 - 3.12

* Star Trek: Generations

* VOY 1.01 - 1.16

* DS9 3.13 - 3.26

* VOY 2.01 - 2.12

* DS9 4.01 - 4.10

* VOY 2.13 - 3.01

* DS9 4.11 - 4.26

* Star Trek: First Contact

* VOY 3.02 - 3.12

* DS9 5.01 - 5.16

* VOY 3.13 - 4.01

* VOY 4.15 - 4.26

* DS9 6.20 - 7.03

* VOY 5.01 - 5.16

* DS9 7.04 - 7.10

* Star Trek: Insurrection

* VOY 5.17 - 6.01

* DS9 7.11 - 7.26

* VOY 6.02 - VOY 7.26

* Star Trek: Nemesis

I tried to keep each ""chunk"" equal to about half a season, making sure not to break up two-parters and keeping crossovers in the appropriate chronology. I think there is room for optimization, and so any comments -- and in particular, error corrections -- are welcome.

I do want to emphasize that I do not consider this or any other order optimal or prescriptive -- ultimately, watch what you like, when you like.

MrDarkHorse,1618666599,msqvm0,1,1,"I think Picard is a lot like The Last Jedi.  I haven't looked at the RottenTomatoes score lately but I know when it came out, it was widely lauded by critics.  It took Star Wars in a new direction, subverted many of the classic tropes, and opened the door for widening the Star Wars universe in different ways by lessening the dependence of the story on the Skywalker family.

It also took a wet, flaming dump on the face of Star Wars' own established canon and Luke Skywalker's established character traits of optimism and determination.  Many, many fans were rightly outraged by this.  

There are also fans who will buy BB-8 toothpaste and will support anything else worth a Star Wars logo on it, regardless of quality or content.  So they didn't care.

There are of course fans in the middle who weren't necessarily happy with the changes, but were excited to see their old heroes in action again.  This is probably the majority honestly.

And naturally, many folks who never liked Star Wars in the first place really liked what Star Wars was doing by changing up the formula, and this is where your high critic score comes from.


Star Trek is experiencing The Last Jedi with Picard especially.  There is an extensive established character for who Picard is, what the Federation is and stands for, and a well known story bible for how to portray these attitudes and ideals in the Star Trek universe.  The original Star Wars story is a very simple good vs evil fantasy told in 3 parts.  Star Trek has many, many times more established canon.  

But Picard picks up the story from TNG, which is easily the most optimistic and professional ""in the heart of the Federation and it's ideals"" show and instead attempts to subvert that and show that humanity and the Federation was never anything special at all.  There were always bad admirals in the show, (it was basically it's own trope) or bad apples here and there (Ro Laren or Tom Paris types).  But these were always presented as an exception that proves the rules that the Federation, and Earth in particular, is a good, decent place that has overcome the frailties of its past.

Anyway, I don't begrudge folks who like The Last Jedi or Picard, because of course everyone is entitled to their own tastes.  But I do feel that folks who like Picard with no reservations are a lot more likely to be people who will eat up anything with the Star Trek logo, or people who didn't watch and love the originals.

I didn't appreciate what happened to Luke Skywalker, and I definitely don't appreciate what's happened to Picard, one of the most respectable characters in television history, and his beloved Federation.

korax-cz,1618606892,mscffj,11,1,"As a retro PC collector, I have recorded my entire collection of Star Trek MIDI music with an OPL3 sound card and uploaded it to YouTube.

Dial-up connection, small hard drive capacities, poor computer performance ‚Äì these were one of the reasons why besides MP3 files, MIDI music was popular in the 90s. Compared to MP3s, MIDI files were only fraction of the size, making them ideal for downloads even with slow internet speeds.

However, you won‚Äôt be able to play MIDI music just like that anymore, and if you would in fact manage to play it somehow, it would sound different compared to the computer you had under your desk when you were younger. While playing an MP3 file produces the same sound on any machine, MIDI files are interpreted differently by different sound cards, depending on the specific chip soldered on the card. Of course, if your PC is able to play MIDI music, it will sound different ‚Äì the tunes will be the same, but the sound will be different.

And so, the only truly reliable way to ensure truly authentic playback of MIDI music, is old hardware. However, that is becoming rarer and rarer over time. Surprisingly, I was able to find only 3 recordings of Star Trek MIDI music of this type on YouTube, and to avoid it being lost forever, I have played it on a PC from 1995 with the right chip on the sound card (OPL3) and uploaded it to YouTube for anyone to enjoy even on modern hardware.

And if you ask why there‚Äôs no Insurrection, Enterprise and all the other good stuff... well, kids, this collection is from time when First Contact and Voyager were the newest of the newest.

Let the ultimate retro begin!

I have been watching Enterprise and if anyone has seen it all the way through than they would have come across an episode that strikes a moral debate that isn‚Äôt easy to ignore. The episode in question that has unnerved me to the point of writing this post is called the Cogenitor. In this episode, captain Archer and the crew of the enterprise, come in contact with a race of explorers after investigating a hypergiant star. The captain of the ship proceeds to take a shuttle pod with captain archer for three days to examine the hypergiant star more closely. Meanwhile, on the enterprise, the crew is socializing with the other species and getting to know them. Commander tucker gets to know the engineer of the other ship and his wife. I‚Äôm doing so, he also comes in contact with the third gender of their species while have lunch with them. They pay very little attention to this person and explain to commander Tucker that the person has no name and is only there to facilitate the conception of their baby. You find out later on that the people in this species who are of this third gender have little to no rights, they are not allowed to read, and have no say in the matter of the reproduction of this baby. In essence they are also using these third gendered beings bodies for the purpose of reproduction without consent. Commander tucker is upset by this information and begins to covertly introduce this nameless person to literature and culture. He teaches them how to read in a day and takes them for a tour on the enterprise. After discovering that commander tucker had been doing these things, the people of this species bar him from entering their ship. But the nameless person sneaks onto the enterprise and asks to be given asylum because they feel that they will not be treated fairly. When captain archer returns and finds out what had been going on, he holds commander tucker in contempt and eventually hands the nameless person back to their people. The enterprise doesn‚Äôt get far before they are contacted with the news that the nameless person had committed suicide. The last scene shows captain archer berating commander tucker for the choices he made and blaming him for this beings suicide. 
I was really disappointed with how captain archer handled the situation. I understand the complexities of the situation and feel that diplomacy is important in this situation. However, I can‚Äôt seem to ignore the blatant disregard for human rights displayed in this episode. And if we are going to get into semantics than I would just reword human rights to sentient-beings rights. Tell me what you guys think. Is it okay to turn a blind eye to this kind of thing?

* The whole concept of a metamorph is just... yikes. (""The Perfect Mate"")
* The whole story of ""The Masterpiece Society"" kinda skims over one of the reasons Eugenics doesn't work: genetic mutation and degredation due to a limited gene pool. Even with gene editing, the colony would only last so many generations before collapse either way.
* ""Darmok"" definitely lived up to the hype! Maybe it should be shown to parents who have more than one teen these days - we have all at least once managed to convey an idea or short message by simply referencing a meme...
* Riker's response at the end of ""Conundrum"" to seeing his main love interest sitting and drinking with his most recent fling was perfect!
* 'I, Borg"" really struck me with The Feels. Kill them with kindness indeed...
* ""Cause and Effect"" should definitely be added to a storytelling Hall of Fame. Brilliantly done, especially each repeat being just so slightly different enough that it wasn't dull to watch over again.
* Picard may not be a fan of kids but he makes a good father figure all the same. (""Disaster"" mainly, though it has been true of the whole show so far.)

I am one of those that's a little harsh on Voyager, but I confess, Season 1 is actually much better than I remember. There's great character development stuff and they were laying a strong groundwork for story arcs. I would say it had the best first season of the Star Trek shows of the era (against TNG, DS9, and ENT). Only two episodes really stand out as bad IMO: 

Time and Again: It was too early in the series for a ""reset the timeline to erase the story"" episode. I'm not a huge fan of those anyway. 

Learning Curve: A meh episode on its own, but made even worse by not being season finale material. DS9's In the Hands of the Prophets did a much better job of bringing a conflict between two crews to a head.

What if the future Michaels mom is trapped in is one where the Borg evolved to the point that they contacted this alternate universe AI and it wiped out all sentient life. This means that something the Discovery does in the past ends up stopping the AI and preventing the Borg from evolving to the point that they can contact the evil race thus saving all sentient life.

Season 2 Questions:  


1. It was said that Spock killed the guards in the establishment he was kept in. This was not true, who faked the \*tape/record\* of him killing thoose guards? The Control or the Section 31?  

2. Where is the original lorca? The one not from the Terran Univers?  

3. The vision what captain Pike seein of his future when he touched the time crystal, is it his real fate in the other series? Or was the Klingon wrong when he said: If you take the crystal you seal your fate?  

4. Who brought the poeple to the Terralysium? I mean Michael did not do such things while being the second red angel. About her Mother, she wanted to save Michael and stop Control from getting the sphere date. But why saving random people and putting them to a random planet?  

5. They all know that there are 7 red signs out there before they even knew anything about time travelling. But when Michael said goodbye to Spock she told him to look for the 7th sign. (as if it did not happen yet) So did they all happen before or not?

Season 3 Questions:  


1. What was Booker hiding in his ship?  Dilithium?  

2. What was really wrong with Detmer? She seemed more stressed out than the others on the ship.  

3. Why did everyone know that Melody which one Gray was playing? Where did it come from?  

4. Did the Sphere date die at the end?  

5. When Philippa Georgiou (The Terran one) was sick of time, she had a vision where someone seemed dieing and she called for him/her as San or Hassan I am not sure anymore. Who is he/she?

JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,1618478885,mrb837,11,1,"I just watched the episode Field of Fire (season 7), and a number of things in this episode annoy me. What do others think?

Ezri becomes the primary investigator when several murders take place. Shouldn't someone in security be in charge? Odo? Ezri is a counselor. Her qualifications seem to be that one of her hosts was a murderer. I'm not saying she can't contribute, but seems weird that she's basically in charge. (Ok, I know Odo's involved... it just feels like it's all Ezri here.)

O'Brien made that weapon way too easily. We all know he's a great engineer, it sounds like he just took a few parts off a shelf and stuck them together with a gun. Those parts were a micro-transporter, and an eyepiece that lets you see through walls. Those are amazing bits of technology that we've never seen before, and it seems like O'Brien just had them sitting on a shelf somewhere.

Micro transporter: so now there's a transporter for beaming small things that can fit in your pocket. This would be an absolutely amazing tool in so many situations. But we never saw it before this episode, or ever again.

Eyepiece that lets you look through walls: Aside from questions about how such a thing could even work, what about privacy concerns? You can literally use this to look inside of anyone's quarters whenever you want. And Ezri does exactly that! I get that murder is being investigated, but there should be some oversight... something like a warrant, perhaps.

Ezri concludes that the assailant is probably a Vulcan because all the victims had smiling pictures in their quarters. Right or wrong, that reasoning is hugely racist. After making this conclusion, she immediately goes to spy on the Vulcan she suspects. She should at least have called security at some point to explain her suspicion, and to get some backup if needed.

And lastly, although not really specific to this episode, we see that Dax can basically recite some incantation and then say the name of a previous host three times in a mirror, and they will appear. On the one hand, this seems silly. On the other hand, it makes me sad she never does this to talk with Jadzia.

I do not like the dystopian perspective they espouse as opposed to the more utopian one that was presented in the older shows. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with loving both the old and new shows which I think everyone agrees on; but it's been bothering that some fans who like the new shows a lot act as though ""Trek has always been this way"" or ""it feels like Trek to me"", when they discuss it comparatively with the older shows. 

There is an objective difference in the tonal and thematic presentation of the newer shows vs the older ones.

Gullible_Risk5990,1618471854,mr9t04,26,1,"A few days ago, I started watched TOS for the first time. My exposure to Star Trek before was limited to the J. J. Abrams movies, which I think are good movies if taken on their own, but from what I gather they're not really true to what Star Trek is about.

I've decided to go with airdate order (I've been told it doesn't matter because the episodes are all standalone, and Netflix uses airdate order so it's easy) and I skipped ""The Cage"" (at least for now) because it was an unaired pilot that had a different Enterprise crew. I've just finished watching the eighth aired episode, ""Miri"". 

So far, I really like this show. I generally struggle with older TV (and by ""older"", I mean pre-Twin Peaks), but TOS is proving to be an exception to that. Even if the episodes are standalone (which is fine, I just prefer serialized shows, or at least partly-serialized ones like Buffy or The X-Files), I love how TOS uses science fiction stories to explore the human condition -- and that sort of psychologically-driven storytelling is what I look for in any TV show I watch. 

I also absolutely love the cast (especially William Shatner, who I always assumed was a hammy actor, but he's really impressing me so far) and I'm really digging the 60s aesthetic of it. Even though the show is set in the future, it's very much a product of the late 60s and I've always been attracted to the style and fashion of that era. And sure, the flipside of that is that it can be dated at times, but for the most part I think it holds up really well and it's remarkably progressive for something from that era.

I think the best example is Captain Kirk himself. The Abrams movies gave the impression that Kirk was a womanizing prick, a depiction of 60s masculinity that might seem problematic these days (like Connery's Bond). But he's really not, Kirk is an outstanding captain who has as much respect for his crew as they have for him. He's an uplifting, inspirational character to watch, and also a total badass, but not in a way that makes him seem like an asshole. The revisionist depiction of Kirk is in my opinion the biggest fault of Abrams' movies. I just really love Kirk, he's easily my favourite character so far, and Shatner does a great job in the role. 

My only real criticism so far is that the supporting characters (Uhura, Sulu, Yeoman Rand, etc...) don't really have that much focus or development. It's nice to have them there and they've all had a few moments to shine, but they don't really seem to do that much. The show is focused on Kirk, Spock, and McCoy -- who are interesting characters, make no mistake, but I guess I'd like a more ensemble cast. That's probably my only criticism of the show though, and it's a minor one at that. 

Anyway, here's my thoughts on the eight episodes I've watched so far:

* **""The Man Trap""** \-- a decent first episode. Obviously not a real pilot, but nonetheless it was a good introduction to the series. The lighthearted animosity between Spock and McCoy was well-established and the salt monster was entertaining enough, although derivative of 50s monster movies. I liked the ethical issues posed by a dying and lonely member of a near-extinct species just trying to survive by any means necessary. It's an interesting question, and it helps elevate what otherwise would be a disposable monster story. 
* **""Charlie X""** \-- the 60s are strong with this one. I don't know if it's the bright colors, the uniforms, Charlie's whole demeanor, or Uhura singing (fantastic, by the way), but this felt very much a product of the 60s, which in my book is a good thing. There's some interesting questions about the confusion of adolescence and how it's akin to being a child in an adult's body, and Charlie acting inappropriately with Yeoman Rand was handled pretty well for the 60s. But Charlie himself is a weak link, he's not a very interesting character and he drags the whole episode down.   
* **""Where No Man Has Gone Before""** \-- the first truly great episode. The title  emphasizes the vastness of space and how anything beyond our imagination can be out there. There's a cosmic horror to this one, and the idea that a fallible human mind (i.e. one that still craves self-preservation above all else) would become a monster if granted an indestructible body is both a terrifying and fascinating concept. And Shatner knocks it out of the park, especially when trying to convince Dehner that Mitchell cannot be trusted with his new powers. 
* **""The Naked Time""** \-- a virus spreading through the ship has an uncanny relevance now. The virus acting like intoxication is weird and leads to some goofy moments, but there's interesting stuff here. The crewman becoming disillusioned with the Enterprise's mission is solid because it reflects how in real-life exploratory missions were little more than plunderers. By removing the crew's conscience, we see that there's a darker side to the human desire to explore and discover, and that further highlights the nobility of the Enterprise's mission. 
* **""The Enemy Within""** \-- probably my favorite episode so far. It felt like the synthesis of the ideas that series has being dealing with up to now -- especially that everyone has a dark side, and that being a good person is not about purging that darkness but rather tempering it with more positive attributes. The idea of literally splitting up Kirk's light and dark sides and demonstrating how neither of them can survive on their own is absolute genius. This is a great script, and Shatner takes full advantage of his chance to shine here. 
* **""Mudd's Women""** \-- on the flipside, this is probably the weakest of the episodes I've watched so far. Harry Mudd was entertaining enough, an intergalactic pimp who's somehow both sleazy and hilariously bumbling, but the story was incredibly stupid and seemed to be based in some incredibly regressive ideas about gender roles. And yeah, this show is from the 60s and a certain degree of dated ideas can be tolerated, but TOS has been above this sort of thing so far. The script is just lazy and the ending is bafflingly dumb. This one's pretty shit, to be honest. 
* **""What Are Little Girls Made Of?""** \-- oh man, I loved this episode until the final 15 minutes. The idea that being human, even with all the flaws that entails, is better than being a machine is one of my favorite concepts in science fiction. And once again, like with ""The Enemy Within"", we get a Kirk doppelganger to highlight what it is that makes Kirk the leader he is. This episode does such a good job these ideas until the ending, which drops all the interesting ideas and just focuses on delivering a ""shocking"" twist. It's such a disappointing waste of potential. 
* **""Miri""** \-- a solid episode, not up there with my favourites so far but still entertaining and thought-provoking. I love the idea that the consequence of experimenting with eternal life is that a group of children are unable to grow into adults -- i.e. not coming to terms with ageing means that you can never mature. But what was with the planet being an exact doppelganger of Earth? I suppose the point was to illustrate that the civilization was identical to ours, but the fact that Earth has a twin deep in space is a bizarre thing to leave unexplained. 

So yeah, I'm quickly becoming obsessed with this show. TOS is dated, sure, but I don't think it's *outdated*, if you know what I mean. While it's obviously a product of its time (for better and for worse), there's also a timelessness about it and I certainly think that the ethical and moral issues that it raises remain relevant questions for our society to ask.

HauntedRaincoat,1618444702,mr39hx,8,1,"So I know that Star Trek has gone through a lot of general changes in terms of how everything looks. ToS to TNG, DS9, VOY was a change, then from there another change with Enterprise. I feel like ToS to TNG's change made sense. But everything always looked so comfy. Why wouldn't I want to join Starfleet? Rewarding position exploring the galaxy, saving lives and learning new things, all while being on a comfy looking ship.

Enterprise came out, and the lack of comfort made sense because it played into how archaic that era was compared to Picard's era. It was during a time where we were just dipping our toes into space and everything looked more military when Humanity hadn't become as peaceful as they were in TNG. 

Then came the Abrams films where they traded this comforting looking ship for a generic scifi look. This bothers me because I feel Star Treks beauty came from the fact that we were evolved to be better than we are now. The comforting environment represents how we have grown as a species in a technological sense. That we could still have huge warships capable of great destruction but yet still make it a comforting area to be in. Also who wants to fly in space for years at a time in a big metal box? That ""Space Hotel"" look the TNG, DS9, VOY ships had made Star Trek distinguishable from all other SciFi shows and movies.

I hate that the comfy aesthetic is gone since the Abrams films and I really wish they found a way to bring it back.

The only thing that has come close was Lower Decks but I can't take it seriously as it is a comedy show, and an arguably just okay one.",startrek,Star Trek's General Aesthetic Change,1602,297,5.393939393939394
twVC1TVglyNs,1618443972,mr32b5,46,1,"I didn't grow up with Star Trek at all, but always thought it would resonate with me. Last year, I started with TOS and it was everything I thought it would be. Since then, I watched TNG, which I immediately loved even more. After that, I went on to DS9, which was a bit different, but I now love more than TNG even. Now, 2.5 seasons into DS9, I'm starting VOY since that's when they aired and I like the idea of switching back and forth (seeing what's going on in the Delta quadrant and then what's going on back on Bajor).

All that said, I'm having trouble ""getting"" Janeway. I'm about 10 episodes in and I never know what to expect from her, and she seems to fluctuate wildly between being badass and confident and being overly worried by what seems to be the most minor issue. Sometimes, I almost feel like the writers are relying on her facial expressions to convey the severity of the situation when they can't figure out another way to do so.

In the past couple of episodes, I've started to realize that she's a lot more like Kirk than she is like Picard. I think I sort of felt the same way about him sometimes. And that makes sense since the types of missions the Voyager is on seem a lot more like TOS's missions of exploration than TNG's various missions spanning diplomacy, war, exploration, etc. Nevertheless, I feel like I still don't understand her value system or motivations or something.

Like I said, I'm only 10 episodes in, so maybe I just need to give it more time, but if anyone has any thoughts they'd like to contribute that might help me understand her motivations better, I'd appreciate it!

LavitzOfBasil,1618398435,mqo9qx,354,1,"This isn't meant as yet another ""new trek"" bashing post but it's just something that popped into my head as I was watching some older sci-fi shows. I know that television in general has changed to favor long, dramatic story arcs and all that nonsense and it definitely works when it comes to star trek (I loved the dominion War for example) but there's no reason why we can't have both. A lot of my favorite X-Files episodes were the random ""monster of the week"" episodes, a lot of the Stargate episodes that didn't involve the series' main antagonist were really fun and refreshing, and so much of what I loved about classic trek was them just exploring those strange new worlds and seeing what was out there.

But what if a commissioned officer wants to join his team? Is O'Brien still in charge, or is he instantly outranked?

Some of it is related in the mini-series ""From the Earth to the Moon"", the one that opens with Tom Hanks. (Fantastic, go watch it. It relates the Apollo-era compressed into 13 episodes I believe, in the frame of reference of the 1960's, by the people who lived it)

The rest is related by Memory Alpha.

&gt; El-Baz was the first Type 15 shuttlepod seen on Star Trek: The Next Generation.

&gt; The Star Trek Encyclopedia (4th ed., vol. 1, p. 231) stated the shuttlepod ""was named for former NASA planetary geoscientist Farouk El-Baz, currently on the faculty at Brown University.""

&gt; Rick Sternbach recalled on the naming, ""And in a supreme example of coincidence, I had suggested that one of the the little boxy shuttlepods in TNG be named El-Baz, after Farouk El-Baz, one of the Apollo lunar geology experts (one of my faves along with Hal Masursky). We had no idea that Rick Berman actually did some filming with El-Baz ages before Trek. The name was approved.

imbarkus,1617985009,mnkqu0,14,1,"I wish I could take you all back in time with me... to what it was like to watch TNG's 'Q Who' first-run.

Some people like new Star Trek, some don't like it. Most fans watch it regardless. The more things change, the more they stay the same. It was much the same as the Second Renaissance played its course after TNG went off the air, as fans split in online response to DS9 and Voyager. It's fine; it's all fine. This is the Third Renaissance. I enjoy it all on a meta-fan level now, after years and years, regardless of some of the details and specifics.

Yay! Star Trek again!

Now, step back, if you will... to 1989.

When TNG was new, it was on uncertain footing. Syndicated first-run television was a new experiment, a successful one that would later give fruit to a whole host of television hits of the 90's including Hercules and Xena and the like as well and Deep Space Nine and Voyager. Original Star Trek had enjoyed such a successful run in syndication during the First Renaissance partly due to the expansion of local televisions stations into the then-new syndicated rerun market, but also because it was entirely produced, and thus costless, to Paramount. A successful movie series (with modest movie budgets for science fiction) had been launched, but it had yet to be proven if a more expensive first-run independent science fiction television series could WIN OUT... with fans of the existing syndicated reruns they had watched for years, and in a financial sense balancing the revenue from the local stations buying the show against its cost of production.

The Ferenghi had bombed out as an effective villain, stooping and scheming and snapping their improbable laser-whips; it couldn't be denied. Q had lost some of his edge in his attempt to recruit Riker into the continuum in his previous appearance as well: begging for permission from the Continuum to do more Q things after Picard tricked him out of the agreement, leaving him stammering like a Kirk-Era AI stuck on a paradox. So, when a second season (tight uniforms!) TNG episode quietly crept onto the screen with an unusually subdued soundtrack, there was little indication of the wild ride a cold, alien, and independently-omnipotent Q would give us.

I won't belabor the point further. Watch the episode again, of course. It goes down real well all by itself, even separate from a full watch-through. I do it every now and then.

With the teasers from the Picard Season 2 trailer, I'm looking forward to seeing that old Q again: the Q that went away for a while until 'All Good Things,' and then settled down into a comfy Voyager family cruise, probably taking care of John de Lancie's mortgage; more power to him.

We saw the Borg again in New Trek, 3rd Renn Trek, I guess. They were almost really scary there for a minute, weren't they? But they wound up mostly a tease. Then again, I did like the implication that the plot didn't dare fully unleash then: at that point they become the main threat if they are true to their nature. And with Seven front-and-center, the Queen concept was key to how they were depicted. You know, people online bagged on how they were used in 2nd Renn Trek too: the feeling was they were a bit overplayed in the last four or five seasons of Voyager. Like TNG's 'Best of Both World,' Voyager's 'Scorpion' wound up a third season peak featuring the Borg reaching heights the series wouldn't hit again, IMO. Other Borg episodes were... fine.

We just had First Contact Day which is a fine idea if--like Paramount+ itself--a little late and not yet dripping with originality beside the featured content itself. Anyway, some people bagged on 'Star Trek: First Contact' at the time of its release for introducing the Queen concept in the first place.

There are fair points to be made for how the Borg concept was diluted and made less threatening. But, really, only 'Q Who' shows the purest, most undiluted form of the Borg; an unstoppable hive-mind concept originally designed to be an insectoid species by (shortly thereafter controversially departed) produce Maurice Hurley, and wisely modified to reflect the fears we naturally have of technology, the loss of our individuality among the mob's consensus, and ""the Singularity."" As much as fans love 'Best of Both Worlds,' and as much as that epic two-parter deserves that love for being amazing epic television that basically took all the uncertainty heading into the 3rd season of TNG and turned it into the Second Renaissance, it was the first dilution of the Borg concept. 

In 'Best of Both Worlds,' the Borg wanted Picard, specifically. When they captured and assimilated him, they improbably gave him a name, ""Locutus."" They put him front and center in all communications. This is a smart thing for the television writers and producers to do, to put the prowess of Patrick Stewart on screen and play the reversal and betrayal. It's great character work and great television that helped launch an era.

But maybe some part of me still hopes the Borg are refreshed again some day, back to the finest, purest original concept evoked in the post title quote. Perhaps after all these defeats due to having an assimilated representative, or even a Queen, they might decide to modify their network to be more like the real distributed internet and less like the South Park Giant Central Router internet. As cybernetic organisms, it's not unlikely they could merely install and upgrade and modify their routines: no negotiation... no regard of individuality at all... you're just RAW MATERIAL to them... resistance indeed futile.

But, if not, that's fine with me too. Yay! Star Trek again!",startrek,"""But for now... for RIGHT now... you're just RAW MATERIAL to them. Now that they're aware of your existence..."" ""...They will be coming."" --Guinan and Picard, 'Q Who'",5654,971,5.8228630278063855

climateking,1617966169,mneqvx,1,1,"and just thought I‚Äôd share my opinion here. 
Overall it was a decent show. I have avoided it totally since watching the first few episodes when it came out, mainly because of all the negative reviews it got. 
The first two series were the best I think. These followed the ‚Äòexploring the galaxy‚Äô theme that TNG had, with only a few double episodes and a vague hint at a bigger enemy contained throughout. 
S√©ries 3 was the worst I think, but only because there was 1 central story and each episode was part of getting to the Xindi and defeating them. It was a nice touch that there were different sub-sets of Xindi and they each had their own characteristics and values. The bigger enemy with the metal spheres was never really fully explained IMO though and I thought this should‚Äôve been explored more. 
The final series was.....stupid. And I don‚Äôt just mean the last episode. There was way too many two or three part storylines and the other storylines didn‚Äôt make sense to the rest of it. 
The last episode was as bad as I had heard. I didn‚Äôt know much detail about it but knew it was bad and that it had something to do with TNG. To have it set just before the decommissioning of the Enterprise, 6years after series 3 was ridiculous. What happened in those 6 years? What happened to T‚ÄôPal and Tucker? Why did they break up? What did they do for 6 years and why was no one promoted after 10 years on the job? I understand they had to end the show but to set it 6 years after series 4 was a bad judgement call. And for Trip to die?? What the actual?? What was the point in that? It was a senseless death, totally unnecessary. Was it the only thing he could think of to beat the aliens? Oh but then 4 days later abs everyone at the ceremony was happy and having a great time despite a colleague of 10 years being killed? Yeah sure.

So I've started a rewatch for the first time in years and noticed something I haven't before.

When Janeway talks to The Caretaker the 2nd time he admits he is dying and was stealing people to try find a genetic match to procreate with.... The subjects of failed procreation attempts were sent to the Occampans planet with a fatal illness.

Does that mean The Caretaker in some way r*ped Harry and B'Ellana? No not in the traditional human sense. Whatever his form of procreation is, it is invasive enough to result in an illness even he can't cure.

The intent of procreating without consent when the result of a failed attempt is illness and death sounds like a special kind of sci fi r*pe to me.

Dr. Bashir's parents seem to be quite average - they aren't famous, wealthy, or high-ranking in any way we know. Yet they were able to find and pay a doctor to have Julian genetically enhanced.

I started to turn to Star Trek to feel a bigger love for humans again and I've landed on Voyager, the same show my late father and I watched as a kid. Despite its deep issues it still has the heart of Trek and parades a humanistic spirit that I think we all need right now, when things are so scary and everyone hates each other and pregnant women are being attacked for where her ancestors were born. 

I just watched an episode where the Doctor has a hologram family to learn about humans and his holo daughter ends up dying. He decides rather than facing it to simply end the program. Tom Paris while in the medical bay gives a beautiful speech to the doctor on shared human pain and how it brings us closer together and that because something is painful doesn't mean it's not worth experiencing despite its awfulness. 

During a time when we've all lost so much I think it's something we can all learn from in these times. I hope that doesn't sound callous in the face of the very real pain others have experienced the last year. I lost my father, but others have lost more, and I know that by facing it together we can come out stronger. What a message. That positive, wistful hopefulness.

One of my biggest pet peeves comes in one of my favorite TNG episodes and it's such a stupid little thing but it's always bothered me. There's an episode where Geordi and Ro end up out of phase with the rest of the enterprise and they end up running through walls, people, computers, etc. They can't interact with anything except for the floor apparently. The fact that they can still walk around without issue has always bothered me and I yet to hear a good reason why they're able to do this.

Official_N_Squared,1617817770,mm7pre,47,1,"Picard S2 is understandably getting all the attention here as far as I can see. And I was under the impression the DIC trailer was a small teaser, but I finally watched it and it actually felt really extensive.

First off, I really like the new uniform. I liked the old ones too but they didn't really work on Discovery's bridge.

Then as I was thinking about how excited I was, and by the sound of things here these past few months everybody else was too, at exploring rebuilding the Federation I heard it.

&amp;#x200B;

""5 Light years across""

Oh no don't tell me-

""That's how large this gravitational anomaly is""

&amp;#x200B;

Then the rest of the trailer goes into ""crisis management mode"". Really, am I not the only one MASSIVLY disappointed at this? This premise just sounds like Burn 2.0 to me, and one crisis after another just kinda feels like you're never actually solving a problem. Take Enterprise for example, who took a season off mega-threats between the Xindi and the Earth/Romulan War. Except the Nazi 2-parter, which always felt really random, rushed, and unnecessary to me. Before even returning home from saving earth it was in danger again.

Even if this is a background that drives the plot on a bit this it feels like to soon. Do the writers need a mega-crisis to write the plot or something? I would love it if someone could sway me but I'm really curious as to what everybody else is thinking. Personally my feeling are that I have no interest in watching S3 again in S4 (though know I will watch in it anyways no matter how good/bad it is) and am actually rather excited d for Picard after seeing the interview with \*you know who\*. So a complete reversal of my anticipation for the two shows.  


At least there's Lower Decks which is a low-risk high-reward show for me. So that's nice.

gingerlemon,1617779866,mlwo8d,9,1,"TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT - to me these 5 shows ARE Star Trek, especially the middle 3.

There's a few qualities these shows had that are sorely missing in new Star Trek:

* Optimism/Tone! Nether Discovery and Picard have any of the optimism, hope, or utopian vision of the future synonymous with Trek. They've become grey and gritty like every other sci-fi.
* Episodes! These shows are more akin to a 10 hour movie than a tv show. Episodes don't have beginning, middles, and ends. You can drop in and watch any episode of Voyager or TNG, and pretty much every time the mystery or problem is resolved by the end - you don't need to know what happened the prior 5 episodes.
* Pacing! Star Trek is slow and methodical; scientific. The new shows are like rollercoasters in comparison.

The fans ask over and over for more Star Trek, so why can't the studios just make more Star Trek?

Why does it have to be ""Star Trek, but mass appeal! It's Star Trek, but for everyone!"" Why do they feel the need to this? Star Trek was never mass appeal, but it had a huge and devoted fanbase that just wanted more content. Why can't they just do this?

I found myself watching with a much closer eye since so much of this arc relates to ST: Picard now and I had a few thoughts that I wanted to share.

Generally speaking I thought the story holds up. I definitely got caught up with a huge grin on my face for Riker's line at the end of part one. This time through I had the thought that it would have been a really powerful way to start the part two episode to have Jonathan Frakes to the voice over for the intro rather than Patrick Stewart. Since Riker had been officially promoted (pips and all) hearing Picard do his usual voice over gave me a false sense of security that I knew the episode would be canned rather than really sucking the audience in that it could have been an actual permanent change. Given the era in which this was made this may be just too modern of a thought about how to mess with the viewers.

Will's promotion was also still as confusing as it was when I was a kid. I was always confused why it was such a big deal between him and Shelby for who was doing what job, and after ""Family"" it's not really mentioned.

Also, Shelby. I feel like in the subsequent seasons or other ST titles they could have used Elizabeth Dennehy really effectively. I thought her relationship with Will was really interesting and nuanced and felt like a much more modern Trek like ST Discovery.

RuudVanBommel,1617713150,mlatbm,17,1,"For the few ones left who aren't aware of TNG's 6x15 ""Tapestry"", Picard dies at the start of the episode due to a heart attack and is being greeted by Q, who offers him to bring him back to a key moment in time. Picard was involved in a fight with a couple of Nausicaans and was stabbed through the heart. He survived, but needed an artificial heart ever since. The whole incident shaped his character in a significant way, but will still ultimately lead to his untimely death, as seen in the opening teaser.   


Picard indeed acts different now, avoiding the fight by shoving his friend before the situation escalates. Picard finds himself alive back in the present on the Enterprise, but has to realize he's just a mere junior Lieutenant now, being an assistant astrophysics officer. Q explains that's exactly what happened in the new timeline. Picard played it safe during that moment and it shaped his character forever. Unsatisfied with such a life, Picard asks Q to bring him back once again to be stabbed, rather living a satisfying life and dying prematurely instead of living a life full of insignificance. Q grants the request and the episode ends with Picard surviving the heart attack after all and him and Riker unsure about all of that being just a dream or another test by Q.   


And now we got the Picard Season 2 Teaser, with the biggest reveal of course is Q being back, the omnipotent being capable of basically everything except wooing Janeway. Picard narrates with the key sentence being *""what we do in a crisis often weighs upon us less heavily then what we wished we had done, what could have been.""*, followed by an hourglass with a reversed flow. What's more, the clock in the beginning shows 10:04, which in my book is an obvious reference to Back to the Future. 10:04 PM was the time a lightning bolt hit the Hill Valley Courthouse, providing the energy to sent Marty back to..., well, the future.   


So my theory is that season 2 will be a whole Tapestry on its own. The teaser featured the bajoran tablet from DS9 ""The Reckoning"". Picard was fond of Bajor and its people and was also a strong proponent of them joining the Federation. One of the biggest indirect influences he had on them was being transformed into Locutus, destroying the USS Saratoga and killing Jennifer Sisko, which ultimately led to Benjamin Sisko being assigned to Bajor. What if one of the biggest regrets of Picard was to not have acted differently during Best of Both Worlds? Not getting captured and therefor possibly the initial plan of firing with the main deflector dish working? Sisko's life would have been drastically different, as would have been Bajor's history in those seven years. 

Focusing on the Stargazer might refer to Jack Crusher being killed during an away mission in 2353, something which had to do with a ""life and death decision"".",startrek,"So will Season 2 of Picard be one big ""Tapestry""?",2863,500,5.726

MitchyPower,1617661597,mkwnd6,2,1,"We are bound by are varying degrees of love towards various Treks, but if there's one thing we can all agree on, it is that Trek encompasses a moral lesson of helping others

If you go to most Star Trek Wikipedia pages connected with today's announcements, you will see them void for the most part. These additions range from the date for Lower Decks and Picard, casting, plot details etc...

As someone who had been watching these announcements trickle in, I began adding these snippets of news right? It's such a fulfilling thing, to feel like you are contributing in some small part to people's understanding of information, and in the pursuit of truth. But with the event being live, sources are hard to come by initially

Wikipedia requires sources, otherwise you could put literally anything on there without consequence, but with this being a live event, it meant websites would not report on these things until minutes or hours later. Which is why it is so important to get the info on there first, and then add a source when they become available

This next part requires context: Wikipedia has two modes, a visual editor, and a code-based editor. One of these is obviously vastly easier than the other, and as someone with difficulty typing things like that from physical disability, I simply cannot dedicate the time and pain required to learn the second of those methods. Wikipedia requires the text-based editor for tables, and other more complicated tasks, which obviously takes a good amount of time from a person like me to get right. So boom, Star Trek's table of series is updated, with the new dates. The source link is broken, but you hope that a better person comes along and lends a hand

Nope

I get a barrage of notifications, like machine gun fire, of one obsessive editor by the name of Alex, just wiping them all out. One of which was even done mere seconds later, insinuating that this guy was constantly refreshing, watching the stream also, and waiting for my contributions, just to remove them, out of some sick joy I suppose? Yes, many lacked a source, and the ones that did weren't formatted greatly, but to think Trek was something preaching companionship, and all fellow ""fans"" can do is kick dirt in your face. 

I use this analogy, imagine you are trying to redecorate, and you paint a room too bright of a colour. And you look at it and go ""Oh no, that colour isn't too right, how about we demolish the house now?""

Also context: This user demands evidence of said announcements, which are easy to come by, considering ""insert title of show"" into google and boom, source. So it required a whole lot more effort to undo what I had contributed, rather than to try and straighten out a few errors

So currently, Star Trek Wikipedia across the board does not acknowledge the events of today at all. Lower Decks is still ""TBD 2021"", Picard is ""TBD"", and pigs can fly.

Some of you might remember a somewhat similar situation with Memory Alpha, where a cast member, who was non-binary, was denied the right to simply have gender neutral pronouns on her page, and it was only after backlash that these things changed

Do not go onto Wikipedia and edit in spite of this unbecoming member, unless you are legitimately a skilled contributor who would be willing to help out on various pages, to everyone else, just take away the lesson that it is a whole lot easier to help someone out than to spite them.",startrek,Today I was reminded that not all of the fandom shares decency,3433,606,5.6650165016501655

joeyfergie,1617646137,mkqxm9,6,1,"In the early 2300's a group of starships, some Starfleet, some from other Federation worlds, some from Klingons, Romulans, and other races, are all attracted to a strange signal. They arrive to where this signal is, then they all lose all their sensor data and communications.

The Federation, having detected sensor distortion from that area and now a loss of communication from all starships, sends out a ship to see what happened. It is all empty space - no starships, no warp trails, or indication that anything was ever there.

Throughout the Federation rumors spread about disappearing starships. Political disputes broke out because each side claimed others attacked them - that they have new weapons and that their ships are still out there. After many years, when it became clear that this was a mystery, it became a distant memory.

Then, 46 years after the initial incident, the same strange signal appeared. Being careful, Starfleet sent a science ship to a safe distance away from the anomaly. The same happened, with strange distortion coming from the signal, but this ship was far away enough that it wasn't affected. However, this time, with the distortion, there was a message - from their lost starships.

It appears that they were transported to a far away galaxy. That after nearly a decade of in-fighting over resources and planets, the different races realized that they needed to work together. The area of space that they are in is not lush with planets, and even fewer are M-Class. So far, they have not discovered any intelligent life. It is suspected that they are in a newer part of space, one that is earlier in evolution than the Milky Way.

Starfleet, using old records, notes that exactly 46 years prior to the initial incident, a similar signal was detected, but this was in deep space at the time, and not something that they were able to investigate.

46 years later, and Starfleet has realized that they can send supplies to the others - they take a group of starships and load them with supplies, food, latest technology, the last near-century of history, as well as all the research that Starfleet had been doing to get them home. They also sent through a message so that if they weren't close by, they would know to pick up the supplies. The same distortion happens, but this time, no message attached.

46 years pass again, and we are approaching the mid 25th Century. Starfleet's top experts on the Anomaly think they almost have enough data to figure out a way home. They know that they may be trying to bring home people who don't want to come back, seeing how it has been generations since they disappeared, but if they are able to create a link between these two galaxies, who knows what that could mean for the Federation and scientific exploration.

So Starfleet builds a new ship purpose built to this mission, with the technology to safely use the Anomaly to reach the other galaxy, and then once there, to find a way to open a gateway home. This vessel would be lightly crewed, with the idea that they would build the crew from those on the other side.

So the ship arrives at the site of the Anomaly. The time arrives, their sensors go crazy and lose communication. And then everything comes back on, and all of the stars have moved. There are no Federation signals - no signals of any kind.

Then they notice what looks like a series of powered down starships. They fly over to see the fleet that was sent in 46 years years ago with supplies. They travel to the ships to see that they are all untouched - the supplies are in the same state as they were in half a century ago. Ship systems shut off to conserve power. No one had ever been there.

They do a scan of the local area of systems, and finds one that has an M-Class planet. They travel there only to discover the remains of a small city, with a dead starship in orbit. They can't find any sign of life, but do find one log entry on the ship. It is from over 50 years ago, and just says 'We found intelligent life. If you are reading this, don't let it find you.'

\--

So the show would follow this starship as they try to figure out what happened, if anyone is still around, and what this threat would be.

joeyfergie,1617644224,mkq7us,9,1,"Had this idea for an episode the other day. Tell me your thoughts!

Pike the USS Enterprise are on a routine mission where they encounter a Klingon ship sending out a distress call. They get onboard and discover what appears to be humans who claim to be Klingons. They take them back to the Enterprise, and the medical scans show that although they physically look human, they are in fact biologically Klingon, easily detectable on scanners.

Pike has a call with Commodore Robert April. Pike tells April how confused he is, because the only human looking Klingon that he knew of is Ash Tyler, but Tyler is biologically human - this is something different. April tells Pike he thinks he knows someone and tells the Enterprise to go to a Starbase.

The USS Enterprise arrive at the Starbase and are delighted and surprised when Admiral Jonathan Archer, along with Dr Phlox beam aboard. Archer is long retired, having last been aboard a starship when the USS Enterprise launched under the command of Robert April. He has since been living comfortably, although supported by many medical apparatus. Dr Phlox had been teaching at Starfleet Academy, but had taken a sabbatical to care for his old friend.

Pike asks Archer what is so important that he had to come himself, instead of just sending information. Archer reveals to Pike top secret classified information - that about a century prior, a group of Klingons had experimented with Augmentation, based on human augments, and had changed their physical appearance. Luckily, this did not spread to the entirety of Klingon society, and those who were ridgeless were shut out, made into a despised labour class, one that was kept from the rest of the galaxy. Some Klingons who suffered the Augment Virus were able to undertake physical reconstruction surgery to look Klingon, although that wasn't available to all.

Archer speaks to the Klingons, who reveal to him and Pike that a world has literally turned into a rotten place even by Klingon standards, and that smooth-heads are forced into slave labour for the chance to get the cure which is being worked on by the Qo'nos.

The Enterprise requests diplomatic envoy to Qo'nos, and meet with L'Rell, who reveals that these worlds are known to Klingons, and that they are a test to show that these Klingons still deserve their ridges. Dr Phlox asks about the cure, which they discovery stopped research decades ago. It appears that there was a decision by the High Council to keep them as a labour class. L'Rell, upon discovering this, put production right back into schedule, and they ask Dr Phlox to stay to help. At first Phlox says no because he is looking after Archer, but Archer tells him that he could help an entire species of people again, and that is more important than just one man. L'Rell makes a decision that smooth-head Klingons would no longer be in hiding, and that those who have proven themselves, even without ridges, can serve Qo'nos and command starships.

The USS Enterprise returns to federation space, and are informed that a ship will meet with them to pick up Admiral Archer. On the bridge of the Enterprise, Archer makes a comment about how he has missed things, and that he likes the feel of this ship, how the buttons and dials are how a starship should be run, not from just touchscreens. Pike quips that maybe all ships will be back to that sometime soon. Ops informs Pike and Archer that Archer's ship has arrived. Pike takes a look to the viewscreen, comments how it is a nice ship. Archer thanks him, goes to the turbolift, and the doors close on him.

Doors open on the Turbolift on the NX01 Enterprise bridge, and Admiral Archer walks on to the bridge. He looks around to the bridge, at unknown officers sitting at Science, Communications, Helm, and Tactical, and the empty chair at the centre of the bridge. As he approaches the chair and puts a hand on it, he hears his name being called and turns to see Ambassador T'Pol. ""I see you got my message."" Archer says to his friend. T'Pol simply nods, saying that she was on a diplomatic mission, but when Admiral Archer asks you to quickly re-commission a museum ship, you listen.

Archer takes a seat in the captain's chair, and with T'Pol on his side, looks forward out the viewscreen. In space, we see the Enterprise NX-01, in it's full refit glory with secondary hull, float by and above the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 as both vessels warp off into the stars.",startrek,Pitch for a Strange New Worlds Jonathan Archer Cameo Episode,4446,775,5.736774193548387

JAdoreLaFrance,1617579150,mk7lye,25,0,"I'm here to make the case for Genetic Engineering.

Yes, a lot of fingers caressed a lot of keyboards thanks to this topic.  But I want the fear to stop, and give way to *prudent* caution.

Firstly, what is this cosa nostra, ""Star Trek""?  Yes, a trek through and in between the stars, and the adventures that ensue both onboard, and when liaising with other species.  More generally, what is it?  It's science fiction.  It's entertaining speculation about science.

SCIENCE.

And I want to put the science back into this topic.  GE is merely an extension of Biology, albeit one with enormous potential (for good, or evil, hence the ethical considerations).  Human stewardship of science has so far proceeded for the good, if you use the population count, and quality of of life of all humans on the planet as a yardstick.

The introduction of new technologies tends to have both effects - humans innately and inevitably find increasingly more efficient methods of killing each other - the bow and arrow, the bonfire, the stockade, the gun, the gas chamber, the nuke.    Humans, with equally internal and inescapable drives, also find increasingly more efficient (and creative) methods of pleasure - the bow and arrow, the bonfire, the bottle, the shooting range, the tavern, the wireless, the restaurant, the dogging site, Reddit, Netflix...

As all 3 of the following - population and quality of life AND our capacity for self-destructiveness - have grown in very slowly, if not generally unchanging proportions, I surmise that we should continue to increase our technical capabilities.

I hear you, figuratively speaking (and I ""hear"" you speaking figuratively); you fret about a quantum leap in GE whose unfolding is so sudden, so abrupt, it overtakes the capacity and competences of the authorities whose competences you already question to decelerate, confine, quarantine, or in the ghastliest, most Hitlerian of scenarios, exterminate it.  There.  I said it.

How likely is that?

We already know the initial traits of psychopathy are evident at 2; such infants engage in notably anti-social behaviour, and are either socialized out of the same a couple of years, or it fizzles out by around 27/28, with however many spells in the the clink, or worse.  There is NO 2 yr in history smart enough to intuit and mimic normal 2yr old behaviour, with the specific goal of evading modern electronic detection, to a degree capable of beating adult, covert human surveillance trained in reading microexpressions.

""Yet"", you say.

At the risk of annoying, upsetting or generally irking some of you, who I really don't want to piss off - I just want to make you THINK - GE should be advanced *conservatively*.  The entire principle of conservatism is to make improvements at a monitorable, controllable pace.  This contrasts with revolutionary - when people have just had f\*cking *enough*, for longer than enough time, of something they shouldn't have endured.   While I have every sympathy for the latter - yes, EVERY sympath - the former is the prudent caution I mentioned at the beginning that constitutes the topic, and my point, here.

If we can increase intelligence in all people by a mere 10%, however you measure the initial 100%, yes, we risk, with the MOST awful sadness, not improving the lives of hundreds of millions as much as they could have been, lest we had done so by 50% and created a Noonien who then develops a weapon that ends humanity.  Forever.

We pay a price for the speed of our advance - that's a maxim that exists EVERYWHERE in life.  I do mean everywhere.  At some point, to be decided hopefully by men smarter than myself, we forego the potential advancements we can make to the Human Genome, for conservatively lesser leaps in intelligence - or beauty - or ambidextrousness, or whatever - that fall within our capacity to monitor, and control.

Now, don't get me wrong - as a Trekker, I salute the great Rodenberry's wonderful mixture of crazed hopefulness, and caution - but I'm gonna get mundane here, walk, while you're still learning to fcking RUN.  Gather, analyze, add to, extrapolate from your data, and refine your ongoing efforts from the results so far.  Rinse, repeat.

What you want is what I hope we ALL want - a species without depression, but with compassion.  Without dyscalculia, but without excess greed for money.  With an incredible gift for creating incredible music - and incredible programming code, or incredibly inspiring memes.

And without the fckh-headism that invaded Poland, or dragged people from Africa in chains, or thinks it's cool that 67% of people work at just over minimum wage and live lives of quiet desperation.

Julian Bashir cursed his parents for rescuing him from a life of the most grinding mediocrity - I think we fans, producers, and humans in general need to wise up, and take us up the wonderful mountain.

We are, all of us, TREKKERS - do we not owe it to ourselves to explore this new frontier?   And if no man has gone there before, let me just say now:

CrinerBoyz,1617566060,mk3ib9,232,9,"The previous longest gap between Star Trek movies was 6 years, 4 months, 25 days, which was the time between Star Trek Nemesis and Star Trek 09. We are currently approaching nearly 5 years since Star Trek Beyond released in 2016. Nothing is in production, although numerous directors and scripts have come and gone. If nothing comes out by December 22, 2022, which seems highly likely considering recent reports suggest they only JUST hired somebody to begin writing a movie in the last month or so, it'll be the longest drought between Star Trek movies since they started making them in 1979.

My question is, why is it so hard for Paramount to greenlight a project? At one point it seemed like there were 3 different scripts in development, but none of them have materialized into a concrete production. I know there have been various levels of strife - pay disputes with Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth (who they wanted to bring back), Tarantino waffling over wanting to do a movie, Bad Robot bailing from Paramount, Paramount's parent company Viacom overall being in awful financial shape - but you can't make money if you don't make something new.

With so many Star Trek television productions going right now, you'd think the time is right to make a new movie. And it's not like Paramount has too many franchises clogging up their schedule. Transformers does well enough but who knows how long it'll be until people get tired of those, and Mission Impossible is a Tom Cruise vehicle and will only go on as long as he's physically able to do them... and the dude's approaching 60. Star Trek is BY FAR their biggest living universe with the potential to tell a huge variety of stories that share the same DNA and either loosely or strongly interconnect with each other. So why the hesitation? Even if you can't line up all the right pieces for a tentpole blockbuster film, there's nothing stopping them from greenlighting some smaller, lower budget stories. Heck they should know that - some of the best Star Trek ever was made creatively on a shoestring budget.

I don't know, it just seems like horrible mismanagement to me. Say what you will about Kurtzman (and I have a LOT to say about what he's done and would prefer to see him move on) but at least he's been able to get things off the ground on the TV side of things.

I am part of many Star Trek groups and generally Enterprise gets a bad opinion. Though, the people in that post convinced me to continue. 

What an excellent series that was. I really only had one instance where I was disappointed (besides the finale not showing the speech) and that was the 2 episodes of the mirror universe. Even then, it was all right. Still better than TNG season 1. I will definitely miss spending time with that crew.

After finishing TNG, I really wanted to get my brother into Trek, but, he couldn't get passed the first few episodes and I dont blame him. Then I told him DS9 is more up his alley, but him spending 7 seasons on something that makes him think of season 1 TNG didnt really work.  With Enterprises production value, only 4 seasons (I wish it was 7) and lack of Gene Roddenberry (sorry Gene fans). I think I will finally get him into Trek.

We know that there would not be companies that work to make a profit, but there still should be some kind of platforms to orgize these services, right?

But I can't really figure out why? Is this because the characters are portrayed as much closer to our own century (they swear, party, gossip like us) or is this because cinematography has gone leaps and bounds for these past since the early 2000s?

RedDogRER,1617520922,mjrgve,12,1,"I love Star Trek. It‚Äôs quality sci-fi that‚Äôs hopeful, funny, poignant, and has been mostly well done on big &amp; small screen. What I feel has been lacking is good games for Star Trek (especially the last few years). They‚Äôre either half baked, money grabs, or Star Trek Online which is good but I don‚Äôt have MMO time any more.

So I saw Star Trek: Legends in Apple Arcade I was all for it for one simple thing: no IAPs. So how would this play out? Well I have to say, if you took a game built with IAPs and then removed them, this is what you would have. So what do I mean? Well you still have ‚Äòthe grind,‚Äô you have timed quests that increase in length as you progress, and you still have lots of random rewarding. You even still have a ‚Äòstore.‚Äô

What you don‚Äôt have is a way to skip, speed up, or specify things by buying. How much time you put in (and a bit how the RNG gods treat you) decide your growth.

I‚Äôm now up to level 40 with my prime crew at ~3k power and I‚Äôm enjoying it. I‚Äôve hit some grindy spots, but I‚Äôm also not worried about being horrifically left in the dust, I can see how much time I can put in and what rewards that will get me, and I also know that I‚Äôm not going to be annoyed that I can‚Äôt compete with people cause they spend $$$ on things. I‚Äôm gonna be happy where I‚Äôm at.

I also enjoy that (so far) PvP is just a way to do more stuff, not required for growth.

I REALLY enjoy this model. I‚Äôm hoping this isn‚Äôt a one-time thing. I see NBA2K and I think ‚Äúoh maybe this is the turning of the tide.‚Äù

I enjoy playing games like this but always avoid it because it is either a money trap or a annoyance because I don‚Äôt want to spend money.

To get this done: if you like Star Trek, get this. It isn‚Äôt breaking any ground for story (honestly it‚Äôs rehashed) but it is hopefully laying groundwork for greater things and I want to encourage that. There are bugs and foibles and areas for growth and improvement, and I hope to see the bugs fixed and the growth realized. If it happens, I think I‚Äôll be playing this for quite some time.

Don't watch all of them! It might sound like heresy to some but this is the fastest way I found to enjoy the story as efficiently as possible: in Star Trek seasons, many of the episodes are inconsequential, and 2 seconds of reading a quick synopsis (on Netflix for instance) is enough to get an idea of whether the episode has meaningful consequences. Skipping some of the filler episodes not only lets you advance faster in the story, but also leaves dozens of episodes you can watch for the first time after you've reached the end! 

You might think that there is a risk of either not understanding the story or missing a critical pivoting point in the story, but so far I haven't regretted any of it. All the episodes I skipped and watched later did end up being pretty inconsequential or of lesser-than-average quality, but it's very satisfying to get extra episodes to watch!

KratomHelpsMyPain,1617470690,mjcyv0,46,1,"TL;DR at bottom  


This thought started out of two of my bigger gripes from all trekdom:  


\*For a ship on a mission of exploration, Enterprise D does very little exploring  
\* Q's character arc goes from menacing trickster God who might just wipe you out of existence on a whim, to comic relief who gets treated like a minor nuisance.  


To the first point, every Episode of TNG starts with the only slightly modified narration from TOS. We're told a clear mission statement to explore strange new worlds and go where no one has gone before. Yet, in the vast majority of TNG episodes, they are going where plenty of people have already been. They are visiting human colonies, negotiating treaties with known species, looking in on planets applying for Federation membership, dealing with Romulans in the Neutral Zone, zipping back to Earth for one reason or another, etc. etc. This is an incredibly inefficient way to explore deep space. It would be like trying to drive from east coast to west coast of the US, but you keep turning around in the middle of the country to run errands in New Jersey.   


I'm currently on a rewatch of TNG and this has been bugging me. The entire conflict in Encounter at Farpoint is that Q is trying to prevent humanity from venturing beyond Farpoint station into the ""great unexplored mass of the galaxy."" They defeat the challenge posed by Q and push on into unexplored space. And then in the second episode they are in position to respond to a distress call from a Federation ship. By the second season, pretty much all pretense of the Enterprise as a deep space exploration vessel is gone. They are routinely rotating out crew, and are running errands around the alpha quadrant for Starfleet.   


A couple of things have caught my attention. First, in the episode ""Conspiracy"" Data detects an unusual pattern of crew redeployments as the first hard evidence of the alien takeover of Starfleet. We also know that there was opposition to the Conspicary from within Starfleet Command (though ultimately they fell to the aliens.) It could be explained that the Enterprise's original change in mission was caused early in the first season by the factions maneuvering inside Starfleet command, both trying to infiltrate Enterprise, and trying to keep Enterprise close to home to help fight the threat.   


After Conspiracy, Starfleet Command must have been deeply shaken, and it would be understandable that there would be a period of self evaluation before resuming normal operations. But that never happens. As things are getting back to normal, here comes Q. The very next time we see Q is the time he introduces humanity to the Borg. This has ripple effects.   


It is not long after Q-Who that we have the war games in the episode ""Peak Performance."" From the beginning there is resistance as ""Starfleet is not a military organization"" and Picard cites a ""shift in focus"" to deal with the Borg threat. From then on, the die is cast. Starfleet is preparing for an invasion. That means keeping your assets close to home.   


Looking beyond TNG, where else does Q pop up - On DS9, very soon after the Federation discovers the shortcut to the Gamma quadrant. Ultimately he doesn't have to worry about humans spilling out of their section of the Galaxy as the Dominion shuts down that path.   


Then he starts popping up on Voyager - the Federation ship on the wrong side of the Galaxy. Yes, there's always pretense for him popping in, but the pattern is that he's always checking in where humans are extending themselves out further across the galaxy.   


Although Q's offers to send Voyager all the way home are rejected based on the price asked, he does provide them with a route that ""takes a few years off."" Who knows what discoveries Voyager missed out on following Q's route? Ultimately Voyager drops off the only members of delta quadrant species and gets home after multiple ""skips"" forward through space Courtesy of Kes, the Borg, and others. Yes, they return with knowledge of different patches of the Delta quadrant, but no means of bringing humans out that far to colonize. Besides, what news they bring from the Delta Quadrant hardly makes it look inviting to explore: Kazon, Vidians, Hirogen, Borg, etc.   


But, the exploration setbacks don't end there, do they? We have a window all the way forward to the 32nd century now, and, as far as we can tell, there was no massive leap forward, no Apotheosis of man into a god-like creature as Picard imagined was Q's real worry. What else might Q have had a hand in that we don't yet know about? The Romulan star going supernova? The Burn? The events that led to the Spore drive becoming lost technology (in the 23rd century?)  


Maybe he wasn't involved in those, but knew what was coming and what needed to be done to hold back humanity just enough that when events played out, they would have the desired effect of keeping Humanity contained. Maybe the slapstick Q we get in Voyager is belying his real mission of checking in to make sure everything is happening according to plan.   


TL;DR - Q dropped the Borg on humanity right after the events of Conspiracy, so Enterprise-D's mission never went back to full on exploration. He then monitored humans wherever they were likely to make large advances outside the Alpha quadrant. Humanity was still on its heels when the Dominion War came, followed by the synth attack. The Federation shifted from an exploration focus to protectionism. Q accomplished exactly what he set out to do in Encounter at Farpoint.",startrek,Fan Theory: Q succeeded at holding back human exploration,5567,955,5.829319371727749

letsgetrandy,1617467144,mjbt03,26,1,"For me...

**TOS** - definitely Spock.  While Kirk was the center, I think it's hard to argue against the position that Spock was the most significant character. Without him the show would have never taken off, and we might not have so much more Star Trek material to work with today.

**TNG** - here, there were a _TON_ of great characters, probably the most character-rich series of them all. Had he more screen time, I might have gone with Worf. But alas, I truly feel that the glue in everything was written into Picard, and portrayed so well by Patrick Stewart.

**DS9** - without a doubt in my mind, Gul Dukat is one of the greatest television characters ever imagined.  But there were many good characters here too.

**VOY** - for me, there is very little doubt that without Seven of Nine this show would have probably been canceled. She added tons of depth to many otherwise shallow plots.  But the doctor was a good runner up.

**ENT** - this one is hard for me, because the screen time and plot focus was far more balanced than anywhere else. However if I had to pick, I would say T'Pal. She (the actress) had immense screen presence, and her character was central to the very idea of Starfleet... a Vulcan representative aboard an Earth-borne vessel.

**DSC** - there is absolutely no doubt that Burnham is the core character, as Star Trek has its first single-character-centered series. However for me, Emperor Giorgiou was the most significant character, and Pike was awesome too, and their absences will make two amazing spin-offs, but I fear the result might leave Discovery very hollow.",startrek,"Most significant character from each series, in your opinion?",1602,278,5.762589928057554
WaveMonkey,1617465109,mjb4xh,2,1,"Taking out an enemy fleet in space would not be that difficult.  You would just need to monitor their communication so you know where their ships are.  Then build a bunch of long range warheads like the one in the voyager episode warhead.  These are high yeild weapons that could probably take out a starship even with it's shields up.  They are much easier to construct because they are a lot smaller then a starship.  The only thing you really need is a lot of antimatter.  And preferably a cloaking device.  Build a few thousand of them and deploy them in space and send them against an enemy fleet.

Have them move into position and when they are ready have them hit every ship in the enemy fleet simultaneously so they don't have time to adapt.  If your really desperate you could also strap nova weapons to them and have them destroy entire star systems.  But that should be only as a last resort.

omahaknight71,1617459423,mj9cs7,129,1,"First off, it was an excellent series. The storylines, character development, and relationships within the series was probably the best of any Trek series I've watched. I enjoyed the series a lot more than I expected to which was a nice surprise and it's a little depressing knowing there won't be any more stories to tell from DS9, at least on video. 

I did have one problem that irked me and it was in the last few minutes of the series finale. &gt;!When Worf is leaving the station and they show the montage of some of his memories, they didn't include Jadzia in a single clip. To have such an integral and vital character that was one of the best of the series be omitted in the final episode was a slap in the face to the character Jadzia and the actress Terry Farrell. She deserved better.!&lt;

I don't understand the shift in understanding from the TOS to TNG where the combat aspect of the federation got replaced with the lie of exploration.  

Starships are not designed for exploration they are designed for war and typically come out on top of the Klingons.  In all the shows with Klingons the federation wins and the Klingons look like explorers.

One pet peeve this gamer has with larger starships in the games is that their saucer sections aren't tall enough to have shuttlebays along their edges.  The canonical Constellation-class starship is unique in this regard.  This hybrid's saucer is equally tall and has shuttlebays accordingly.

The top two secondary hulls are dedicated to shuttlebays, just like the ones on the Ark Royal.

The bottom two secondary hulls support the assault phasers and provide power to the rest of the behemoth, just like the ones on the 854-meter-long Yamato.

Unlike the Yamato, Ark Royal, or Proxima, this hybrid has two additional warp nacelles.

Undecided: Whether the three warp nacelle pylons should have weapon emplacements between the nacelles, just like the Constellation-class.

LEGO just recently released some pieces which I really needed for this, so I was finally able to complete by USS Cerritos model!  It's built at 1:1250 scale, assuming a length of ~450-460 meters (based on the diagram seen in the series).  Some of the shapes were definitely a bit of a challenge, but I'm pretty happy with how she turned out!

Here's a size chart of my fleet so far, plus a compilation of individual shots for each ship:

wowbobwow,1617288977,mhx2f6,5,1,"Not sure if this is allowed here, but I recently picked up a PC game that I suspect any Trekkie / Trekker gamers would enjoy too. It's called Starcom: Nexus, and it's really cool! it's in that nameless genre of ""you're a person with a tiny space ship set loose in a big galaxy, and you can pursue a career being a trader, or pirate, or take sides in interstellar wars, or whatever you want, all while exploring and customizing your ship."" If you're an oldschool gamer, you could think of this as a modernized version of Star Control, or StarFlight, or (if you were a Mac gamer in the 90's) like the Escape Velocity series.

It's not technically a Star Trek game but it's got a *serious* Trek vibe throughout, both in the aesthetic and in a lot of the things that you might find as you scan random planets or encounter various aliens throughout the galaxy. It's definitely the kind of game where you can be hyper focused on it, micro managing everything... or you can just pick a direction in space and turn on the auto pilot and let the ship fly itself for an hour (which can be helpful at times, since it'll start to fill in the *enormous* map). Anyway, I bought it on Good Old Games (gog.com) and it's also available on other platforms like Steam. I hope you guys enjoy this too!

Picard then says that Starfleet would seize Data and strip him down to the wires to find out what went wrong with him.

So ... Data is not an autonomous being, with the full rights and privileges of any other sentient being of the Federation? I understand the line was included to make the scene come across as very dire, but surely every civil rights organization of the 24th century would be apoplectic about Data's human / ""sentient being's"" rights being violated.

Data is obviously protected by the laws which protect other sentient beings--and this is an open and shut case. Sure, court-martial Data, and even imprison him after a fair and open trial--if he really did break the law, but it would go against everything the Federation and Starfleet stand for if he was subjected to ""extraordinary rendition"", and taken to some blacksite where he was in fact ""stripped down to the wires to find out what went wrong"".

All that said, this line of dialogue makes it easy to see that when Authorities, who have the capability, want to break the law, they just go ahead and do it.

I've had CBS All Access for 2 years, but just haven't had the time to devote to these little gems - apart from *having* to watch the first one because of its tie-in with regular-season DiscoTrek (little kids and work and all that).

I just finished *The Brightest Star,* and it struck me just how foundational this short story really is - not just to *Discovery*, but in fact to all of Star Trek.

So keep in mind, I watched Disco Season 2 *The Sound of Thunder* first. Basically, this episode is where the Kelpiens regain their freedom from the Ba'ul, thanks to Captain Pike ""doing the right thing"" (use of this term is probably debatable, but for the purposes of this post, that's the term I'm going with).

By season 3 of Disco, Kelpiens are now spread throughout the known galaxy. They were apparently at some point a member planet of the Federation (I haven't researched this issue enough, so please don't ding me if I have that partially or wholly incorrect). And let's not forget that The Burn was caused by a Kelpien child with genetic mutations.

And quite literally none of this would have happened, at all, if there was just better quality control on the Ba'ul ship that lost that piece of communications equipment. The same piece of communications equipment that Saru used to contact Starfleet, which resulted in Captain Georgiou ""rescuing"" Saru.

WaveMonkey,1617190225,mh439k,15,1,"If you ask me the maquis were insane.  They were fighting a war on two fronts.  They were fighting the cardassians but because of that they were hunted by the federation.  Also they settled on those planets knowing they were in disputed territory.  So that wasn't the smartest thing to do and it makes their cause less sympathetic.  But here is is how I think they could have won or at least better defended their planets.  

First set up planetary defense systems.  So that even if your ships are away they can defend their planets against almost anything. Not easy I know but considering they were trying to hold planets against a heavily armed hostile force it would be a smart thing to do.  A planetary defense system could destroy a fleet of ships.  So the defiant would have been annihilated when it tried to poison the atmosphere of a maquis planet.  

Second invest in long range missiles.  Something like the devices used in the voyager episodes dreadnought and warhead.  The raw materials for constructing these devices is minimal.  But you would need a lot of antimatter.  They would need to be able to travel at warp, defend themselves, and preferably cloak.  Just imagine if they sent a few dozen of them to the cardassian homeworld.  Or they could use them to take out the cardassian fleet.  This is a much better option then investing in building starships and they can also be used for planetary defense.  

Third support cardassian dissidents.  A lot of cardassians weren't happy with the regime at home.  So use them to try to cause choas on cardassia prime.  They may not accept support from the maquis so use the third party so they don't know the maquis are supporting them.  With any luck they can throw the cardassian empire into complete disarray.  Keeping the cardassian military busy so that they turn a blind eye to the maquis.  

Fourth  Get the klingons and or romulans to recognize you as an independent state.  That would make a huge difference with how the maquis are treated by the federation.  They wouldn't be outlaws anymore they would be a sovereign state and starfleet would have to follow the prime directive and not interfere in their affairs.   Also make deals with the klingons and or romulans to provide cloaking devices for your ships and missiles.  And maybe even schematics for old cloaking devices that haven't been used in decades so you can build your own.  And once the klingons invade cardassia work with them to bring down the cardassian empire.  

Five establish heavily fortified fall back bases in the badlands and other areas.  So that if you are overrun by the cardassians or the dominion you have somewhere to fall back to.  Once the dominion allies with cardassia you will have fortified planetary defense systems and powerful missiles that can repel jem'hadar warhsips.  So you can push the jem'hadar out of maquis territory.  If not then head for your fallback bases and prepare for war.  

So this is how I think the maquis could have won the war.  Their leaders weren't totally incompetent but they weren't exactly brilliant military strategists either.  Of course most of their leaders were former starfleet officers so that explains their somewhat incompetence when it comes to military strategy.  So  how do you think the maquis could have won the war.  Let me know what you think in the comments.",startrek,How the maquis could have won the war,3363,574,5.858885017421603

lukem8899,1617161425,mgx62z,15,1,"I've seen a lot of people complain about &gt;!Picard's death and return in a ""golem android body"".!&lt; I know I'm very late to posting a discussion post about this, but I guess the beauty of Trek is after 55 years we can still find things to discuss and debate. Anyway:

**I don't hate the fact that it happened, I hate that they're 100% not going to use that to the story's advantage going forward.**

When I think of pre-TNG movie Picard and how he would deal with this situation I imagine him asking these kind of questions:

* ""Have you taken into account the implications of what you have done to me? You have just found a cure for death. How many countless millions of lives could be saved using this method, but will not get the chance? Don't they to deserve a second chance at life?""
* ""If you had to program my new body to eventually die then that stands to reason that without it I might live a very, very long life. What right do you have to determine loosely when I will die? Have you fully considered the ramifications that you can now create a being, even an entire race of beings and tell their bodies when to give up on them, essentially commiting genocide disguised as 'natural causes'?""
* ""Who gave you the right to bring me back? I was fully prepared to take my last breath, a truly unique part of the human experience. Now that has been robbed of me, not by medical science, but by removing my body from the equation entirely. Also, how is my current 'consciousness' real and not simply a recreation, a forgery of the memories and experiences of Jean-Luc Picard?""

But, of course, none of these very rational, very thought provoking, deeply concerning and very Trek-like questions will be raised or explored in the slightest because *Star Trek: Picard* is a Pew-Pew show.

I'm really hoping I'm proved wrong and *Picard* Season 2 gives us an insightful look at mortality, identity and gives us the ""character study of Picard"" that we were promised. Guess I'll just have to make do with ""flesh and blood androids"" (sooo... humans? Just humans that haven't come out of a womb and are technological despite having no technology in them? *sigh*), a whole lotta punching and kicking, Seven of Nine in name only, R E F E R E N C E S, and cameos because the producers know that I'm a simp for all things TNG.

WhiteVell,1617147849,mgt5d4,4,1," I started my journey in Star Trek last year seeing the two seasons available for Discovery, then I started TOS (in its glorious slow pace, something I came to admire), ENT (and all its history of origin for the Federation) and it was in the third DIS season was when things changed my perception. I loved the first two and now that I have acquired an experience in this universe I saw how something started to bother me, Burham being Spock's sister. It seems that it was something that was only put in the series to serve as a lure for people who saw only the new films or who had a reasonable knowledge of ST. Do not get me wrong please, I think the series has very good points and it was a great way to be reborn ST in this new era, but Michael didn‚Äôt need to BE Spock‚Äôs sister, this is just a silly retcon to get attention through media. Okay, I ignored it and moved on, I started watching TNG (I'm loving all the dynamics that the team has and its subhistories) and some days I'm seeing LD and well ... after everything I've seen from Star Trek, that definitely not, of course I understand that this is an animation with an emphasis on comedy and I agree that it has wonderful jokes, but most seem to be something straight from the last season of Rick and Morty? (The one where they made Rick become a God why, yes? \[and the fans\]) (disclaimer: i still watch Rick and Morty, but the way the show is turning in the last season is not good) Returning, the main characters mostly spoil the series entirely with a model of humor and jokes worthy of a bully or a teen comedy movie ""nerdie"".

EmberOnFire13,1617142271,mgrcwf,24,1,"I'm relatively new to Star Trek. So far I've only watched VOY and TNG, but I'm loving it so far. I'm currently in the process of finishing DS9 ( second season ) , yet unlike the previous shows I can't seem to like or trust the captain Sisko. 

I think one of the main reasons I find it hard to trust or like him, is his approachability. Compared to the previous captains, he almost seems unapproachable, particularly when he lets his anger get the best of him .Futhermore we don't really see him form any friendships with any of the other crew members yet .So far, most of his relationships have been strictly business, save for Dax and his son.  


Secondly, maybe this is just my impression but I don't feel his motivations the way I did with the previous captains. Atleast with them, I could genuinely feel how much they cared about their ship and their crew members, but with Sisko, it doesn't really feel like he cares , or atleast he doesn't show it.

At first I could not tell the reason, but after having just binge watched The Expanse a few weeks ago and re-exploring some other Treks again, I start to realize perhaps it is the speed and voice pitch that makes words ""missing weight"" ?

SMG for example - her emotional acting (a lot of people dislikes Burnham crying all the time but I am ok with it tho) and action scenes I would definitely give good marks. However imho she definitely speaks too fast and too high-octave in many important scenes and moral arguments. Sometimes that really makes me forget she was supposed to be Vulcan-trained and highly analytical as a science officer.

Imho a great acting contrast to this is Mary Wiseman as Tilly, since she is portrayed as socially awkward so speaking fast would actually work in favour of her character's realism. When she plays Killy, who obviously is more firm and confident, she would speak slower and slightly low-pitched and it really gives me the cold-blood sensation.

While a lot of people dislike Discovery and I absolutely agree it is not the best Trek compared to past series, I still enjoyed it greatly and still am glad that the story can continue.

But I  don't mean his physical escape from their company and environment. I mean, how did he break the Borgs' hold over his *spirit*? It is clarified (in the same episode) that it isn't simply a matter of removing the implants (which Beverly says would be very difficult), nor is it a matter of blocking or jamming the Borgs' signal-link with Locutus-Picard (LP), because that might be fatal to Picard. Later, after Data has tried to interface with the Borg through LP, the latter suddenly shows ""increased neural activity"". Data says it's unclear what's causing that, but Ms. Troi steps in and says, ""No, it's not! It's him, it's Picard."" LP then takes hold of Data's arm, apparently in an attempt to establish a physical link to the human world. (And it sure is ironic that he does that with Data, who is a machine.) Ms. Troi then reports to the bridge that ""Data has made first contact with Captain Picard."" Data observes that the break of the Borg's hold over Picard was not his doing, and that it was ""Captain Picard himself who has somehow managed himself to initiate contact.""

Okay, but how? Is this elaborated on in any later episodes? I have not seen all TNG episodes, so I'm not sure. What I wonder about in particular, is why others can't (or don't) escape. The Borg aren't really a race, but a collective of ""assimilated"" races. Presumably all of those races were intelligent creatures like humans, Klingons, Romulans, Vulcans, etc. If Picard could be saved, can't many of them be saved? If no, why not? What made Picard unique? If yes, shouldn't the Federation make an effort to un-Borg the Borg? And if they did, what would be the method?Does un-Borging a creature require that he/she be extracted from the Borgs' physical environment?

So much so that the she started drinking like a fish and couldn't stop.  She would show up on the bridge completely wasted.  And unable to string together coherent sentences.

a_hi_lawyer,1617001122,mfjpaj,14,1,"Big Star Trek fan, and overall have been really happy with the new shows (DISCO, PIC, and LOWER DECKS).  Regarding DISCO, there are two points in particular I do not necessarily NOT like about the show, but it seems these points indicate that two ways, DISCO runs counter to previous Star Trek shows:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Too complex for my son to watch.**  I grew up watching TOS in syndication in elementary school, and I loved the show.  It became one of the shows that my mother and I used to watch together.  Now, I have a nine year-old son, and I think the story archs of DISCO are too complicated for him to follow.  I've watched episodes of TOS, TRAINING, and DS9 with him, with no problem in comprehension.  Either the DISCO producers missed the point that Star Trek has traditionally be a family-friendly(ish) show, one that parents and their children can watch together, OR they've deliberately made DISCO more complex to target an older, more **sophisticated** demographic.  Yes, I have watched DISCO with my son, and he likes it, but I think he is responding more to the visual effects and quicker-paced editing than to the plot.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Star Trek is about the team; DISCO is about Michael Burnam.**   Star Trek is basically ""e pluribus unam"" in space.  TNG is a perfect example: Different combinations of characters are able to solve different types of problems.  Yes, they are lead by a singular captain, but all the various characters are very competent, and the writers end up writing for different combinations of characters.  When different situations arise, different characters--who have been developed over time--assemble together to solve the problem.  DISCO, in nearly all three seasons, is about Michael Burnam, to the detriment of almost all the other characters.  Yes, some characters have have been developed, but I would argue only a few, and the rest have been woefully ignored.  As an example, when the bridge crew was fighting to retake the ship toward the end of S03, how many of the regular, reoccurring characters that were participating in the retake could you name? Other than Tilly.  And of those that you could name, could you describe their personalities as easily as you could the TNG characters after the end of TNG S03?  Like I said in my first point, above, this may have been a deliberate move on behalf of the producers, to produce a show with a more strongly-developed main character, in contrast to the shows (TOS, TNG, etc.) that came before.

canopus76,1616997978,mfizv1,1,1,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been recently rewatching some of my favourite Voyager episodes, after binging Stargate for the past year or so for the first time. 
One episode in particular has bothered me for 20 years, Season 4‚Äôs ‚ÄòWaking Moments‚Äô. 
During the course of the episode, we are made aware that Chakotay thought he had woken up after his lucid dream with the alien. However some time later, he wakes up properly and the EMH advises he has been asleep for almost 2 days. Fair enough. 
Later on, Janeway, B‚ÄôElanna and Tuvok are becoming aware that they are dreaming and are prowling around the ship. Ok, no problem. 
Chakotay at some stage goes to the bridge to do sensor scans, and sees the moon on the main screen. He starts saying ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt real‚Äô, and Tom Paris, Janeway and the EMH are present, and say ‚Äòof course it is‚Äô, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre paranoid‚Äô etc. Then they physically restrain him. Then he wakes up again due to the EMH giving him a stimulant.   
My question is where did this Tom Paris, Janeway and EMH come from? The EMH can‚Äôt be in the collective dream, as only the live crew members can participate. What this a completely disconnected lucid dream Chakotay was having? As soon as he wakes up, you see dreaming Janeway resuming her walking around Voyager with Tuvok and B‚ÄôElanna. So that Janeway was not in the last Chakotay dream, just prior to him waking up and then beaming down to the aliens cave. 
I hope that my question is somewhat clear, yes it maybe some disconnected dream that just Chakotay was having, but why? To me, this part wasn‚Äôt explained. It would have been better for the aliens to have intervened and say you‚Äôre mistaken that this is a dream.

treefox,1616929985,mezhkc,31,1,"I'm just about to finish watching Voyager from S2 onward linearly. Before this I'd watched the tail end of the series when it aired, then S1 when I got my hands initially on a DVD set, and then a great deal of the show in a more ad hoc fashion via streaming.

However, watching it in order, and in a short period of time, it becomes obvious that there are a lot of character and story arcs, even though the episodes generally aren't serialized. And you know...that actually suits Voyager's premise. They should be having encounters with a planet, then not really running into that group again or having sporadic encounters, and that's pretty much exactly how Voyager works.

But, it's the character arcs that really become evident when watching the episodes in order.

Tom starts out as a dick, initially pursues Kes, becomes the medic, gradually becomes more competent in that role, and him and B'elanna's romance plays out over multiple seasons. It is a point that he doesn't get any letter when Voyager gets the initial message dump, and also a point that he hears from his father when Pathfinder makes contact, a nice bit of continuity.

B'elanna's episodes do tend to be repetitive conflicts over her Klingon heritage, but at least some of them (particularly the episode over genetically altering her daughter to make her less Klingon) are still damn good and pertinent (unfortunately) today. ""When the people around you are all one way and you're not, you can't help feeling like there's something wrong with you."" To be honest, the repetitiveness in and of itself is thematic.

Seven's episodes gradually become less about her learning basic social skills to being forced into a role as a mentor or parent. Her persuasive strategies go from ""You must comply"" to becoming more contextually aware and persuasive. She starts to make witty or wry comments about the Doctor when he's being a little entitled or self-centered and doesn't seem to be aware of it.

The Doctor goes from passive-aggressive whining to having fluent full-throated disagreements with Janeway; the scene in Virtuoso when he argues Janeway into letting him stay on the planet to become a performer, imho, one of the low-key best written and acted scenes in the series because of how unscripted and spontaneous it feels. And eventually he grows into the ECH role and is forced out of his comfort zone. He stops requiring other characters to go to bat for him and goes to bat for himself more often.

Harry Kim, sadly enough, becomes more disgruntled and fed up with being just an ensign over time. I've seen the behind-the-scenes reasoning of ""someone needs to be the ensign"" and it's dumb. But at least by season 6 and 7 the show is self-aware enough to make it a plot point and run with him literally arguing what everybody in the audience is thinking, that he's overqualified for his rank, and give him a chance to do more.

Janeway also feels like she becomes more complex and thoughtful, and just less stiff, than she is initially. Arguments over individuality with her tend to become more reflexive about past character development - eg she let the Doctor or Seven evolve, so why not X. She starts out as a scientist and seems far more at ease at playing the negotiator or being crafty by the end of the series. I don't see S1 Janeway being able to handle Q and Junior with anywhere near as much savviness as she does in S7.

Even though Icheb doesn't really get *that* much screentime, I am much more pissed at Picard now. After watching him and the other Borg children grow over multiple episodes, him getting screwed over by his parents, then taking refuge on Voyager, trying to contribute and find purpose, and connect with Junior. There isn't really anyone else his age on Voyager, and he doesn't have anywhere else to go.

Neelix takes things less for granted over time, going from a kind of sketchy possessive boyfriend who oversells himself, to having an episode where he admits that they've reached the edge of his knowledge, and taking things much less for granted in the episodes after that point.

Even though Chakotay and Tuvok don't get a ton of character development, it kind of suits them. Tuvok of course is older than anybody else, and Chakotay already commanded a starship (albeit a smaller one) before Voyager.

Kes gradually goes from naive to wise, incites the Doctor's early character development, and gradually becoming more confident and competent, even being able to instruct the Doctor in surgery when he begins to forget (in the Swarm iirc).

And then there are incidental background characters, like Samantha Wildman, Naomi Wildman, or Vorik, who pop in every now and then to give the feeling that it's not just the mains and a silent Lt. Ayala in the background of every shot. If anything, Voyager needed more of these characters.

When Voyager runs into species after they've passed through their space, characters remark on them being out of their area of space; there's definite continuity to whether Voyager is near the Kazon, Vidiians, the Borg (to some extent), the Malon (sigh), or the Hirogen.

Kadis Kot and Vulcan Jenga / Kal-Toh also seem to sort of become fads at different points, as real board games do. Ditto for Captain Proton or Fair Haven, or that French bar, which are recurring settings and have their own story arcs of sorts.

Then there's technology, such as how Voyager's crew realizes that taking a ride in a shuttle, especially with Chakotay, is basically suicide. It's especially evident in either S2 or S3, when there's a run of several episodes where every other episode is basically someone going on a shuttle trip where they crash or it gets blown up. Paris eventually remarks that ""class-2 shuttles just don't cut it in the Delta Quadrant"". Prompting them to build the Delta Flyer, which manages to only get completely blown up just once.

The Doctor's holographic imager comes up in a few episodes as well, IIRC, even though it's only a pivotal plot point in Latent Image. The mobile emitter, astrometrics, Borg regeneration alcoves in cargo bay 2, etc. change character dynamics or the feel of scenes and help date episodes.

And of course there's the occasional issue of past characters or groups that badmouth Voyager as an easy scapegoat to avoid culpability, resulting in issues for Voyager's reputation when people reference a past incident from a different point of view.

As far as story arcs, for example, the conflict with the Hirogen is actually pretty serialized across at least two seasons, with Voyager pissing them off by accessing their network, taking the network down while trying to get a message from Starfleet, Arturis trying to use the message to lure Voyager's crew to the Borg, the Hirogen eventually catching up to and capturing Voyager, Voyager trading holodeck technology for their freedom, then dealing with the fallout from the Hirogen abusing the holodeck technology. Each of these are separate episodes in a long story arc, it's just that the story isn't told with back-to-back episodes. The conflicts with the Malon, the Kazon / Seska, the Vidiians, Suspiria and the Ocampa superpowers, the Q, etc can all be seen as multi-episode story arcs. Voyager's past actually catches up with them a *lot*.

So, the fact that a whole season or the whole series isn't a ""Year of Hell"" is not something I'm really upset about. There are enough little bits of continuity to make it feel like a group of people that are growing and changing. There's room for more, like accounting for resources or damage to the ship, or some question of how much Starfleet structure makes sense in the Delta Quadrant, but I'm not sure if pedantic accounting of the ship's dilithium stores etc. would really make for a better show. Even Battlestar Galactica only goes so far in accounting for resources, allotting a few episodes to water, food, fuel, or ammunition, then once it's solved (mostly in the first season) it's usually for good.

If I were to change something, I'd probably prioritize adding more recurring background crew members or passengers to add more variety to the episodes, give the leads more opportunities to explore different facets and relationships of their character, add more real tension when characters are put into danger, and give characters opportunities to join and leave the ship.

If I were to make Voyager's overall plot more like a particular episode, I'd probably choose to focus more on The Void than Year of Hell. The cooperative solution to the prisoner's dilemma there is something that I feel is core to Star Trek. Forming a coalition of people against a common enemy is easy. Doing it without a common enemy when everyone needs the same resources and the people with the most vital ones are the least ethical is hard. Having to decide where to draw the line in that situation is a hard call for which there isn't necessarily a right answer.

BoxedAndArchived,1616907576,meuw7k,23,1,"Trek has some odd pieces of lore, but it occurred to me the other day that writers of modern Trek have latched onto those pieces in weird ways, some are explained ok and are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, others are more major.  For me, some of the writing weirdness is why modern Trek has been harder to like than 60‚Äôs, 80‚Äôs, and 90‚Äôs Trek.  There are three examples of what I interpret as ‚Äúweird assumptions‚Äù that came to mind: Twin androids, Klingon Organ Redundancy, and the cause of the Burn

Picard featured a colony of soong type androids.  This is actually the best explained of the three since there was an actual technobabble explanation of ‚ÄúFractal Neuronic Cloning.‚Äù  Still, the entire run of Picard‚Äôs first season, I thought it was odd that all the Androids were twinned, but then it occurred to me that Data was a twinned android too, with Lore.  It made me wonder if the writers assumed that since Data had a twin, then did all androids have to have a twin?  Of course Data wasn‚Äôt created as a twin, nor was Lore, nor was B4, but I have to wonder.  Now, all things considered, since they actually gave an explanation, I can let this one slide despite the fact I think it‚Äôs a strange quirk.

The next one is visually annoying until it comes to one single scene in the season 1 finale of Discovery and that scene really annoys me.  In TNG, it‚Äôs established that Klingons have double redundant organs to compensate for the injuries common in Klingon life.  But, from 1979 until 2012 (Star Trek Into Darkness), the outward appearance of Klingons was relatively consistent.  Especially concerning their external biology, they are mostly the same as humans.  Look at all Klingons in TNG, DS9, Voyager, and several movies, specifically look at their nostrils: they have two.  When Discovery came along, now they have four nostrils.  It‚Äôs almost as if the writers saw that Klingons have double redundant organs and they assumed that logically they should double something that is visual in order to reinforce this piece of lore.  And then there was the one Klingon who was taking a piss on Qo‚Äônos and has two streams, implying that male Klingons have two penises‚Ä¶  There are several instances of Klingon/human relationships, how does that work? Regardless, the two dong Klingon irks the hell out of me, but so does the massive change in Klingon appearance.

This last one is one that has actual consequences, galactic consequences: the cause of the Burn.  The Burn was caused by a symbiotic relationship between a Kelpien and a Dilithium planet and a trauma to this Kelpien caused a wave to go out through subspace that momentarily rendered all Dilithium inert and therefore any ship with an active warp core suddenly had an unmoderated Matter/Anti-matter reaction destroying all of those ships.  The thing is, this makes the assumption that the only thing powering warp drive is M/AM throughout the entire Galaxy, when in TNG, DS9, and Voyager, there are multiple examples of ships being powered by things other than M/AM.   90s Trek took an IDIC approach to technology: given millions of civilizations all having different resources, there are bound to be many who figure out a completely different method of powering an engine that warps space allowing for FTL simply because they don‚Äôt have the same material resources as other races.  And when it gets down to details, we rarely see the Warp engine of most races and the only races that we know with absolute certainty use Dilithium in a M/AM reactor is the Federation and the Klingons.  On the other hand, we know that the Romulans use Artificial Quantum Singularities in their largest ships and MIGHT use M/AM in smaller vessels.  Add to that, since the Romulans had joined the Federation at the time of the Burn, why wasn‚Äôt the AQS used as an emergency replacement at the very least?  It wouldn‚Äôt require the use of a material that mysteriously stopped working and caused countless deaths, after all.  But no, the AQS isn‚Äôt even mentioned.  I can only assume that this is another example of the writers latching onto the fact that the Federation uses M/AM, therefore EVERYONE uses it.",startrek,Strange assumptions by the writers of modern Trek,4166,716,5.818435754189944

banjoman63,1615998637,m74cay,0,1,"I was reflecting today about how we have a lot of conversations comparing different Treks, but we don‚Äôt compare Treks to the media landscape at the time of their creation. I think it‚Äôs an important lens to view from.

I don‚Äôt necessarily want to focus on 1:1 relationships  (ST:TMP was obviously emulating 2001 A Space Odyssey, DS9 was related to Babylon 5, Lower Decks and Rick &amp; Morty, etc). I‚Äôm more interested in general genre and form of the era. So what was the most popular tv/film form of each era, and how did it influence these shows?  


* **TOS - The Western**. Yes, TOS shared many similarities with The Twilight Zone, but TOS was more often sharing the airwaves with shows like Bonanza, Gunsmoke, and The Rifleman. A working title for Gene Roddenberry‚Äôs new show was ‚ÄúWagon Train to the Stars.‚Äù Just like these shows, TOS focused on the virtue and strengths of it‚Äôs leading man. Westerns featured mustache twirling villains, mono-cultural indians, and admiring women, and some of these elements made their way into Star Trek.
* **TNG/DS9/VOY - The Sitcom**. u/A_Bird_Soaring ‚Äòs post last week made me think of this - they pointed out that in each episode, the captain leads the whole crew through the philosophy or morality of a given situation, weighing different perspectives. The story structure, the carpet, the ‚Äúvery special episodes,‚Äù and the emphasis on discussion all point to the Sitcom. And the inclusion of children/family on ships (Alexander, Jake/Nog, Naomi) created a focus on ‚Äútargeted, all ages content‚Äù  - as well as an increased emphasis of these crews as blended families themselves.
* **DISC/STP - The Superhero Movie**. I‚Äôm not the first to point this out, but these new shows with serialized narratives, heightened action elements, increased special effects, macguffins, and emphasis on world-ending (or Federation-ending) stakes are all elements of the modern action movie, especially a Marvel movie. Instead of the family of the crew, we focus on the main character and their antagonist. The twists and turns in each episode, building on previous episodes, is very reminiscent of comic books themselves.

I think this analysis can lead to interesting discussions - both about how these shows reflect, and reject, the shows they shared the airwaves with. But too often it seems we divorce these shows from their times, which I think does a disservice. It leads to unrealistic expectations, or creates misguided arguments of what ‚Äúis or isn‚Äôt Star Trek.‚Äù The only way for a show to be greenlit is for producers to pitch something that reflects what‚Äôs popular; what we can hope for is that they take the best of what‚Äôs popular, rather than parroting the worst. We inevitably get some of both.

Looking forward to thoughts you all have below - What do you notice by comparing TNG to Full House, or STP to Captain America? Or is that an unhelpful comparison? Where does ENT fit in?

They have the technology to make point to point transports without a transporter pad as we see them do it regularly from away missions to sick bay or space to the cargo bay.

&gt;&gt; RED ALERT &lt;&lt; (or Reed Alert if you want)

In the crash depicted in the episode (Harry's first attempt to fix things), Seven receives the updated phase corrections through her cranial implant, but they fail and they get thrown out of the slipstream. Tom states that they are ""just a few parsecs from the Alpha Quadrant"" and then Voyager crashes into the ice planet. The time between Seven receiving the corrections and leaving slipstream lasts 22 seconds.

In future Harry's second attempt, Seven receives the new phase corrections and both Voyager and the Delta Flyer leave slipstream without incident. The time between Seven receiving the corrections and leaving slipstream lasts 24 seconds.

Shouldn't Voyager have reached the Alpha Quadrant border by the end of the episode? A parsec is equivalent to 3.26ly. A few parsecs from the border is trivial using warp drive.

But for the rest of the series, it is depicted that Voyager is well within the Delta Quadrant, and from Janeway's log, they only saved 10 years (10,000ly), and haven't even crossed into Beta yet.",startrek,Shouldn't Voyager have reached the Alpha Quadrant border after Timeless?,1139,186,6.123655913978495

That said... I am new to Deep Space Nine! Just a few moments ago I finished the pilot, ""Emissary"". I found the plot a bit confusing, but I thought it was a solid introduction to the cast, I found the idea of an alien who didn't understand the concept of linear time to be intriguing, and I was engaged through-out. I'm looking forward to continuing the series and already I like the protagonist Sisko. 

However - and this is the point of my post - I'm a bit confused as to some of the elements of the show's premise :) 

I know who the Cardassians and the Bajorans are, and I get the general gist of their relations - Cardassians are brutal invaders of Bajor, and Bajorians are enslaved by them. But I'll be honest, I think the last time I sat down and watched TNG was over a year ago now, so I dont remember it all terribly clearly and I think I could do with a refresher and watch the most important past episodes to bring me up to speed with the Cardassians/Bajorans story-line. I remember Ro Laren and her episode from TNG, so I think I may re-watch it as it seems like it'd be important to catch up on. 

Are there any other important TNG episodes you would recommend I go back and re-watch, before continuing on with DS9? To make sure that I'm lost and can keep up with the story, and who all the different species are and what their motivations are?

The above title goes for many of the alien actors on various Treks, but I've always found Ethan's and Armin's performances of Neelix and Quark special in a way that no other actor of alien species could deliver as they did, if only because noone else the had the opportunity by the sheer number of times they were called upon to do so.

The above picture is a scene in S6E14 - Memorial, where he is suffering from PTSD, taken just before he lets Naomi go, whom he held as hostage up until then. It's all of 2 seconds long... His face first reveals an internal struggle as clear as daylight - between trusting a friend of many years or listening to his own self when every fiber of him is telling him that it's not safe to emerge from hiding, then it becomes set briefly into what I think of as Neelix's ""thousand yard stare"". 

The desperation, the tears on the verge of being shed, the fear, the almost maddening experience of being in a life &amp; death battle where so many die but surviving to continue on living, it's all there in his face in those 0,5 seconds that made it onto screen.

 There is a presidential election between a candidate who is more of a supporter of democracy versus one who's far more authoritarian in nature.

This is a situation where I can't help but think that if that accusation caused the one candidate to withdraw that could lead to the more authoritarian candidate getting elected and this authoritarian candidate has a very poor record in regards to women's right in contrast to the one accused of sexual harassment and is even proposing a ""Proof law""  that could make it harder for someone to file charges of sexual harassment against their employers. So while the democratic candidate withdrawing or being brought to Justice would indeed bring Justice to the alleged victim, in the end it could end up being far more harmful to other people in the future  who are sexually harassed or abused in a work setting

This isn't intended as a hate post, and I completely understand a long drawn-out fight scene would be awkward in every episode.

They encounter aliens on a ship that don't know how to repair anything, because they relied on the computers on the ship.

I need to know the specific series and the episode.  Does anyone know this?  Does anyone know the specific season and episode?  That would help a lot.

Again, I believe it was star trek the next generation.  There also might have been another plotline going on and it may not have been the primarily focus of the episode.  However I clearly remember it being part of the episode.  I think this series sometimes incorporated lesser plots or related plotlines into the main plot.  However they could have made this the main storyline since it seemed interested.  As in how did they lose what they learned.  Why did they become lazy in regard to learning.  Why did they just rely on the ship computer system.  There could have been other issues and history they could have incorporated, but they instead relegated this as a small scene within the main story of this episode.

Excited to hear y'alls thoughts and opinions!

----------------------

Knowing that Enterprise marked the end of 18 years of continuous Star Trek, I had my skepticisms on the show's quality. I was happily proven wrong and found myself loving Phlox's informal therapy sessions, Trip's sarcastic banter, T'Pol's infinite perplexities at the pink skins. By the end of the third season I felt invested ‚Äì these characters had made an impact. After all, the NX-01 is arguably the most important starship in the history of the Federation. Its place in history deserved a send off equal to that of the ship's notoriety. Instead, we got ""These are the Voyages"". 

**The Berman and Braga Maneuver**

After contributing over six-hundred hours of Star Trek, the duo had one final job before retiring once and for all to Risa.  It was an impossible task. They had to send off a beloved franchise that had influenced multiple generations and captivated hundreds of millions of people. More specifically, they were saying goodbye to the starship. Production and development of the series finale paints a vivid picture plagued by Paramount oversight, miscommunication amongst cast, and journalistic criticism. 

Paramount was reluctant to admit they had plans to cancel the struggling series. Their judgement misguided by larger ambitions of the Ferengi variety ‚Äì profit. As the third season was wrapping up production, Paramount believed they would more easily sell syndication if Enterprise was 96 episodes instead of 74. This was their primary motive in renewing for a fourth season. Despite knowing their intentions to cancel the show, they waited to announce until syndication was officially sold. The cast became aware near the end of production for season four. Attention quickly focused upon the show‚Äôs send off in their final episode.

Cast members began deliberating on what would be an appropriate and fitting send off for the series. Connor Trinneer, who plays Trip Tucker, later commented ‚ÄúI wanted us all to have the big M*A*S*H moment ‚Äî the really memorable farewell‚Äù ([TV Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20080210083618/http://www.tvguide.com/news/trek-enterprise-finale/050523-05)). The show‚Äôs producers had a different idea in mind. In fact, they had an entirely separate show for the finale. They had a vision to create a new episode of The Next Generation that reflected upon the final days of the NX-01 crew.

To Berman and Braga‚Äôs credit, this episode had always been planned as the fourth season‚Äôs finale. Through unfortunate circumstances, it became the entire franchise‚Äôs send off. The producers adjusted the script to have a greater emphasis on nostalgia and fanfare in an attempt to match the final episode‚Äôs status. When all was said and done, ‚ÄúThese are the Voyages‚Ä¶‚Äù came into creation.

**Have a Nice Trip**

My favorite character from the crew of Enterprise is Commander Trip Tucker. His sarcasm and relaxed demeanor brought a sense of normalcy to this grand sci-fi adventure. As the show grew, he became one of the most important officers in Starfleet. I was not alone in these sentiments, because the show‚Äôs producers had big plans for Trip in the series finale. Namely, they wanted to kill him off.

There is simply no benefit of the doubt here. Trip‚Äôs death was rushed, handled poorly, and an insult to Trinneer‚Äôs phenomenal work. In less than five minutes the show transitions from peaceful and nostalgic reflections to four gunmen ‚Äústorming‚Äù Enterprise. Going against all of Trip‚Äôs character development, he decides to disobey orders and trick the gunmen into a trap ‚Äì which consequently kills Trip as well.

At face value, Trip would be the type of person who sacrifices themselves for the greater good. It is the hastily scripted, rushed death that ruins this moment for fans of the show. To add fuel to the fire, unneeded guests Riker and Troi casually foreshadow Trip‚Äôs demise throughout the entirety of the episode. More time is spent building suspense and intrigue than on the character‚Äôs actual death.

The commander‚Äôs death is used as a point of intrigue by Riker. A means of solving his own personal struggles with morality. This structure detaches viewers from caring about a character they have grown to love over the past four years. Unfortunately, Trip was not the only Starfleet officer caught in the crossfire of this rushed finale.

**The Human Vulcan**

The episode placed heavy focus on emotion and nostalgia. Two things which do not meld (pun intended) with Vulcans. Instead of investing time and energy into developing a coherent conclusion to T‚ÄôPol‚Äôs character, the producers of the show decided to simply make her human. The result being an emotional, caring, and thoughtful individual that in no way fits the canonical definitions of Vulcan.

In all honesty, this is a problem that developed slowly throughout the shows life. T‚ÄôPol was used for everything from sex appeal, to love interest, and even a slave. In order to achieve these things, the shows producers disregarded her vulcanism and relied upon a rather lazy aspect of the Vulcan species. That being the fact that Vulcans do have emotions, they simply train themselves to forgo them in favor of logic.

T‚ÄôPol is particularly affected by Trip‚Äôs death in this episode. Wait, sorry ‚Äì that actually does not happen. Despite Riker awkwardly interrogating the Vulcan about her past relationship with Trip, T‚ÄôPol spends a few minutes discussing her desires to meet his parents and that is it. I interpret this lack of response as being indicative of the writer‚Äôs attempting to make her Vulcan. Their efforts are futile in comparison to Spock‚Äôs encounters with death throughout the franchise and are inconsistent with their handling of the character elsewhere.

These short comings painfully culminate in the show‚Äôs finale. Nowhere is a Vulcan to be found. Blalock was passionate about portraying this species, and has publicly spoken about her disappointment in how the character was handled.

**Archer's Not So Glorious Speech**

The show ends on a high note of Captain Archer giving his famous speech that marks the early foundations of what would become the Federation. An auditorium filled with thousands upon thousands of individuals from over 15 worlds are in attendance. A speech so monumental, children are taught to memorize it in grade school. It is the perfect sendoff to an important crew, a beloved franchise, and the NX-01.

Except the show‚Äôs producers decided to have none of that. Once again, the cast of Enterprise is set aside in favor of Riker and Troi‚Äôs story. The way this scene is handled is almost condescending to fans. The Next Generation cast banter about how important this speech is to their history. Troi asks of Riker, ‚ÄúOr do you need to hear the speech again?‚Äù At this point fans are angrily screaming at Picard‚Äôs first officer to let the holodeck continue. Instead, he ends transmission. Thus queueing the ending of the episode, which features a montage of Kirk, Picard, and Archer uttering the famous words of The Original Series‚Äô opening.

This set of events can only be described as a blatant bait and switch by the producers. Would lifelong Star Trek fans prefer to hear the very speech that gave birth to the federation, or have a lazy fanfare montage that adds nothing to the franchise? The answer is obvious yet we were refused such a monumental moment.

**All Good Things**

This episode marks a disappointing end to a show that remains critically underrated. It marked the conclusion of nearly two decades of Star Trek, and the last episode of the franchise for twelve years. Canonically, fans consider the episode before it to be the official send off of Enterprise. It is often ranked amongst the ten worst episodes of the entire franchise, but none held a more significant promise than that of ‚ÄúThese are the Voyages‚Ä¶‚Äù",startrek,"The Tragedy of ""These are the Voyages...""",8166,1315,6.209885931558936

Unapologetic_Canuck,1615766743,m57ymv,27,1,"TL,DR: watched Discovery S1 for the first time after not caring about it since release, general opinion has changed and am enjoying it so far. 



I remember trying to watch Discovery when it first started airing, but for whatever reason I couldn't really get into it and just pretty much just ignored it existed from then on. I've watched the previous series, including Picard, but Discovery just didn't grab my interest at first. I guess I was more into the older style of Star Trek than the newer stuff. 

However, I've been a heavy lurker of this sub for a while, as I like to read about other people's thoughts and insights when they share their thoughts upon watching one of the series for the first time, and I've seen many a post regarding Discovery and the events that have happened this far. But not having watched it myself, none of the details made sense, so I was unaware of events that had taken place this far. 

After giving it some thought, I decided to bite the bullet and give Discovery a round two, to see what happens. I've made it through the first season so far, and while it's definitely different from the older series, it's not the hot mess that I guess I came to believing initially. 

Now I didn't go into this completely blind, I do know the general overview of the plot throughout the seasons, I just didn't know any of the specifics. I am looking forward to watching the second season, and then the third.

One thing I will say though, is that I've always been the type to enjoy the starships themselves and their respective designs, and while the Discovery is slowly growing on me, it's still one of those 'this thing looks kinda weird' situations. Perhaps as I watch more it'll grow on me some more.

sunrisevampire,1615759219,m55ewk,58,1,"This might be an unpopular opinion and I'll probably get downvoted for this. I've been re-watching Star Trek TNG and DS9 for over a decade now and I never really paid much attention to how morally questionable Lwaxana Troi's behavior is. I'd always loved it when she came on the show. It was always a hoot watching Deana get all embarrassed by her. I immensely enjoyed episodes where her character would make an appearance.

This re-watch around I've been watching the show a bit more critically and it dawns on me how unpleasant of an individual she is. I know she's a character written for a show in the 90s as comic relief(and some serious ones too) and maybe I'm reading too much into this.

She's portrayed as this lovable and empowered woman who's a Federation ambassador and the mother of a beloved character. She's the auntie we all love. She's had a lot of powerful and fantastic moments on the shows which is all great. But.... she doesn't respect the personal boundaries of people. It seems that consent as a concept is completely lost to her. 

She reads people's minds using her Betazoid telepathy without their consent which is a massive violation of privacy. I have social anxiety and this is the kind of person that I'd dread running into IRL. In fact, I've known people like this who brush off their behavior like some personality quirk even if it's seriously affecting the mental health of people around them. 

In TNG, she's constantly hitting on Picard, reading his mind, and making him visibly uncomfortable. She makes inappropriate comments towards crew members and doesn't seem to have a filter. She can't take a hint which is even worse as she's a telepath and she can literally know and feel what someone is thinking.

A lot of the times Deana is mortified. Maybe there's a double standard. Imagine if your older father visited your place of work and started hitting on your boss and other younger co-workers. He would immediately be seen as a total creep and even kicked out of the place.

In DS9, Odo was seriously freaked out by her advances to the point that he had to complain to Sisko, who then completely trivialized it like it wasn't even an issue. She was practically harassing him and following him around the station. Odo was literally pleading to be left alone. I know the episode had a happy ending but I don't like the message that it sends. That it's okay to wear down someone until they give into your advances.

She's been racist towards Worf on more than one occasion. She even says that Klingon brains are too primitive to be capable of telepathy. As if telepathy is an indicator for a species' sophistication. She's clearly elitist about being a Betazoid and some kind of telepathy supremacist. Deana even rebukes her that it's common courtesy not to communicate in telepathy when there are non-telepaths around. She completely disregards it.

The shame is that I really liked her character before and these moments are really ruining it for me. I feel like skipping the parts wherever she comes on. What are your thoughts on this? Am I nitpicking this or does anybody else feel this way too?",startrek,I'm re-watching TNG and DS9 again and realize Lwaxana Troi is a bit of a creep and a racist,3137,548,5.724452554744525

When I was a teen I was suicidal. There was a lot of abuse in my home, with me or my mom being the primary targets. I had no one to turn too for help and the people I lived with were a very poor examples as to how a person should behave. Due to my home life I was very shy and timid which invited bullying and my school life became as much of a hell as my home life. 

I spent a lot of time trying to lose myself in fiction and media. Books, video games, TV shows, movies and music. Science fiction and fantasy where my go-to, and helped me forget about reality. 

TNG quickly became my favorite show. I loved all the characters and loved pretending like I was a part of the crew. The inclusiveness and non-judgemental approaches to problems was inspirational and made me hope that real life people can be like that. 

Captain Picard stood out as my favorite character in fiction because I wished that I could grow up to be like him. I stopped thinking of killing myself and started trying to shape my actions as if I were trying to be like Captain Picard.

It may just be a show, but it is part of the reason I am still alive today. It played a vital role in shaping who I am today. I have re-watched the show maybe 10 times now, and I still like to imagine being part of a family that actually cares about you.

Germanic_Pandemic,1615733341,m4we9d,80,1,"**Don't read this if you haven't watched the entire series!!**

There's so much potential for what they left off with. Cardassia is basically in ruins, its people trying to rebuild their society after the dominion attacks. The dark side of the Federation and Star Fleet has been exposed, the Dominion is changing into something we can't really fathom at the moment, Ferengenar (Ferenginar?) is progressing as a society after being stagnant for so long, and who knows what's happening with the Klingons and Romulans. There are so many storylines they could follow with this, and they could maybe even touch on them all in varying degrees, but here's what I'd wanna see.

The series should have two main focuses: the rebuilding of Cardassia, and reforms happening within the Federation (maybe even a large number of planets wanting to secede). I wouldn't want the same characters from DS9, I'd want some new characters to be explored. But there would maybe have to be one or two characters brought back as main ones. 

Garak, I think, is one of them. He'd probably be pretty important in the rebuilding of Cardassia, as he was very influential in the resistance and even seemed to lead on after Damar was killed, so it'd make sense to bring him back as a main character in the Cardassia storyline. I'm not sure who another would be, but others may have nice ideas for that (go ahead and say who you think should be brought back üòÄ). Possibly Kira, as well. Though, they'd have to resolve the issue of Cardassian hatred of Bajorans üòÖ

But it'd be cool to see the Federation in an even more desperate state than they were in during the war, as if it's golden age just came to an end. I don't know what the story would look like exactly, but there's so much that could be done. Heck, they could even weave in a storyline about the changes to the dominion after Odo helped the founders to trust solids again. It'd be cool to see what would come of the Jem-hadar (not sure how to spell it) and the... Well, i forgot the name of the species, but they're the ones with the mushroom hair, blue eyes, and xylophone ears (and Weyoun was one of them).

But, there is one scene that has always bugged the crap out of me:

UFP President Ra-ghoratreii getting briefed on Operation Retrive, a proposed rescue of Kirk and McCory from Rura Penthe, in his office. An operation that would illegally violate Klingon sovereignty and would quite likely result in the loss of Klingon life, in order to rescue men who have been convicted of assassinating the Klingon head of state. Something that, if it got out, would be absolutely construed by the Klingons as an act of war. And he is doing this incredibly risky thing IN FRONT OF THE ROMULAN AMBASSADOR.

Now, apparently this scene was cut from the theatrical version but it was put back in for home release so as far as I'm concerned it's canon.

So, is this just one dumb scene that nobody thought through logically? Yes, yes it is. And we can either accept that or come up with an insanely elaborate head canon to explain it away. Well, are we Trek fans or are we Trek fans?

So here's my theory: Starting at some point between their last TOS appearence in ""The Enterprise Incident"" and ""Undiscovered Country"" the Federation and the Romulans were not enemies. In fact, they were in a full bore military alliance.

There's little evidence of this, granted, but there's no evidence to contradict it either, as a result of the Romulans being used so sparingly in the movie era. The only Romulans seen in the films prior to Nanclus is Caithlin Dar, the quarter human Romulan representative on Nimbus 3. But that proves that the Romulans were at least engaging with the Federation on a diplomatic level, and that there had been some migration between the two nations in this period so I think it strengthens the argument for a Federation/Romulan alliance rather than weakens it.

Here's a few things that might be explained by a Romulan/Federation military alliance in the 23rd century:

1) Why Romulan aggression doesn't seem to be a worry throughout the TOS movie era.

2) Why the Federation apparently made no effort to develop cloaking technology between acquiring a cloaking device in the Enterprise Incident and signing the treaty of Algernon **43 years later**. Maybe it was a condition of their alliance with the Romulans?

3) Why the Klingons felt they had to militarise to the point that they caused the collapse of Praxis. They've been outflanked by a combined alliance of the Federation and Romulans, just as the USSR was when Nixon went to China (as the ancient Vulcan proverb goes).

4) Why the hell the Romulan ambassador is just chilling in the Federation president's office while this highly illegal operation is being outlined. Because how are those Starfleet troops planning on getting to Rura Penthe? In a cloaked ship, courtesy of their Romulan allies. Nanclus is there because he's an ally, and he's in on the heist.",startrek,Lore Theory: The Federation-Romulan Alliance of the late 23rd Century,3049,524,5.818702290076335

# Concept/Idea

 üññüèæ *Star Trek* ‚Äì TOS/TAS ‚Äì ‚ÄúAnd you people... you‚Äôre all... astronauts? On... some kind of star trek?‚Äù

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: The Next Generation* ‚Äì TNG ‚Äì Not your momma‚Äôs *Star Trek* (see also: *Degrassi*). The same *Star Trek* you know and love but involves people born outside the original era portrayed in TOS/TAS.

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Short Treks* ‚Äì ST ‚Äì Alliterative. Should be ‚ÄúSTS‚Äù as an homage to the space transportation system whose test flight vehicle carried the name of the ship from ENT. Features short, self-contained stories within the Star Trek universe^(\[1\]) (STU). 

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Lower Decks* ‚Äì LDS ‚Äì Nostalgia bait. References an obscure, much-panned, late series episode of TNG. Revolves around individuals who are not senior officers.

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds* ‚Äì SNW ‚Äì Nostalgia bait. References a deep-cut quote from TOS and, later, TNG. This series returns to the exploratory (alien/planet of the week) nature of past Trek. Cranial ridges TBD.

# Locale/Setting

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine ‚Äì* DS9 ‚Äì Nostalgia bait. References the existence of deep space stations (see also: Deep Space Station K-7; Deep Space 5) within the STU (do NOT see also: Leola Root Stew). Focuses on the senior officers of a station which exists on the fringes of Federation-controlled space.

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Voyager* ‚Äì VOY ‚Äì A damned good name for a ship. Revolves around the senior officers of the Federation Starship Voyager.

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Enterprise* ‚Äì n√©e *Enterprise* ‚Äì ENT ‚Äì Nostalgia bait. References the name of a space shuttle which never went to space. Centers on dinners served with ice tea and occasionally wine.

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Discovery* ‚Äì DSC ‚Äì Another damned good name for a ship. Whether they discover much is pointless. Focuses on an officer who finds themselves stationed on the Federation Starship Discovery.

# Outliers

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Picard* ‚Äì PIC ‚Äì Nostalgia bait. Focuses on a rather obscure, background character from TNG that resonated with fans. Fits within **concepts**, yet also **locales** in a poetic way the primary character would agree with.

 üññüèæ *Star Trek: Prodigy* ‚Äì PRO ‚Äì Remains to be seen. Clearly these kids are bright enough to operate a derelict starship. Whether that‚Äôs the right way or the wrong way to run a Federation starship, Janeway is involved.

In my opinion Star Trek Voyager is the best part of the Star Trek saga since TOS.

In this part of the Star Trek saga you can see a new species and civilization of the unexplored quadrant of the galaxy. You will see the first contact with specie 8472 and their bio-ships. You will see the ultimate battle vs the borg queen.

I just finished the show and it all just felt right to me. 

Aside from some occasional clunky dialogue I loved the new characters, how Rios ends up following Picard and believing in the mission despite the trauma that was plaguing him. That moment where he asks Picard basically ‚Äúwhat if we‚Äôre wrong‚Äù and Picard reverts right back to the confident, dedicated leader he used to be. 

I also loved the multiple versions of his personality split over the the ship‚Äôs holos. I think the draw of a new Star Trek show is getting to see how they creatively build a crew and keep things feeling fresh, (Spock to Data to Seven of Nine etc.) so a bunch of versions of the same guy each with different accents and personalities is just a perfect evolution to me.

I think Raffi is a great redemption of a broken, bitter person. Picard did sort of abandon her, he was selfish and turned away from the people he loved because of his pride, and she‚Äôs right to be upset with him. But I think  after she sees her son and it really doesn‚Äôt seem like things can be patched up, she realizes she can still make amends with him at least. Picard‚Äôs arms are open to her in the way she was to her son, the choice is her‚Äôs to fix things then. They‚Äôre very similar, solitary people with a lot of walls up, so I liked how they sort of resolved the faults in each other, I‚Äôm excited to see where their friendship/partnership goes. 

I‚Äôll also add that Elnor coming to her, needing someone to cry to, really got to me, that physical affection of this young person in need, being able to give him that comfort, was exactly what she might never have with her son.

Finally, that final scene with Data... I‚Äôm a wreck, and I didn‚Äôt see anything like that coming. The whole show Picard is having these dreams about being able to talk to Data again, not wanting the dreams to end. He finally gets his wish but in meeting the real Data again (or some form of him) he encounters Data‚Äôs wants and needs, the ultimate want to know his impermanence and to die. This isn‚Äôt at all what Picard would have imagined meeting Data again would be, (EDIT: for data to ask him to end the dream) but he fulfills his friend‚Äôs wish selflessly. 

Those shots of Picard sitting beside him as he goes in the simulation were really touching to me, because we never get to see our heroes die on their own terms, the way anyone would want, with someone they love holding their hand, content with their life. 

Anyway, I could probably rant incoherently about this show for a while, I just wanted to see what others connected with in the show. I know a lot of people here weren‚Äôt really into it, but I figure there‚Äôs probably some of us who liked it and wanna chat about it.",startrek,"For those who Star Trek: Picard worked for, what were some of your favorite parts?",2782,514,5.412451361867705

My suggestion.

Episode Part 1 opens.

We see Janeway walking through a corridor, she looks different, wait, her hairs in a bun. She enters an unfamiliar office and says, ""*Commander""*.  The adresse looks up, its 2271 era Benjamin Sisko,  complete with hair, clean-shaven, and only three pips. Opening credits roll.

We arrive at the present day in the Captain's ready room. Chakotay and Janeway are having one of theirs totally platonic, not romantic, no siree, dinners. Chakotay is talking about the Starfleet official history and analysis of the Dominion War battles of DS9, which came in with the last transmission burst. He says he is impressed by Benjamin Sisko's leadership, especially the mining of the wormhole. Janeway, mentions that she actually met Sisko before the fateful sortie into the badlands. 

We have a flashback to that, which continues sometime after Janeway had entered the office in the stinger. Sisko is sharing DS9 's badland navigation data and intelligence reports about Chakotay's cell, and his own assessment of the man. Janeway asks if he knows him, Sisko says no, but they overlapped at the Academy and everyone knew who Chakotay was due to his boxing prowess. Janeway then expresses some sympathy for the Marquis, which seems to annoy Sisko. Janeway, noticing this, gives thanks to him for his help. She says that this combined with Tom Paris's knowledge of the cell should be invaluable in completing their mission. Sisko then says he knows the former CO of Caldik Prime and he thinks Tom's punishment was excessively harsh, to Janeway's enthusiastic concurrence. Kira enters and advises Janeway that Voyager is ready to depart. She hands her a PADD, and tells her those are the unique Comm codes, which Voyager will use to contact DS9 on a secure channel. 

Back to the present day, the episode continues as in the original real-world one.  The Doctor diagnosis Tuvok's illness and has to report it to the shocked Janeway. Paris and Ba'lanna's baby is overdue and Seven is talking to Neelix, whose replacement as Mess chef Chakotay and Janeway are discussing when Harry calls them.  Sensors have discovered the Transwarp conduit as they did in the original episode., but the difference is that it's unguarded and small. Janeway, after a lengthy meet, decides to go to investigate, though Chakotay worries about the Borg.As Voyager approaches it and sends a probe through, the scene changes, and the Borg queen is seen viewing Voyager. She instructs ""*keep observing it out of range of sensors and don't assimilate, for now.*

We see a PADD carrying ensign walking, wait, why is she wearing Alpha Quadrant unforms, oh this is DS9 in the present day. She enters Sisko's old office, only instead of Sisko there is another Starfleet officer n command......well damn, it is Kira, in a Commander's uniform....Bajor did end up in the Federation after all. The Ensign says comms has been getting hails on a secure channel, but its an old code...Kira looks at it and exclaims that its the one she herself gave Voyager, seven years ago. She asks the origin of the hail and is told that it's from the other end of the wormhole.......Voyager is now in the Gamma Quadrant.

Jerrmaus,1615657730,m4bbg6,7,2,"Question for you all out there. (sorry if this has been address before).

I am going back and watching TNG, its what I grew up with and is always the pinnacle of Trek for me.  But....I did have something that struck me as odd.

&amp;#x200B;

In TOS, most away teams consisted of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and a bunch of random security officers.  It always struck me as odd that the captain would be put into potential (and most times obvious) danger so frequently.  

&amp;#x200B;

With TNG, they address that.  Picard almost never is part of the initial away team.  (He comes down from time to time after the site is secure).  However.....the away team is always made up of like....3/4 of the senior staff.  Almost never do they bring the random security guys anymore.  

My question is...with all the lore of Trek, is there ever a reason given for this?  Like....it looks to me that you have all these different divisions of labor....Science, Command, Technology and Security etc.  That you would have a group of people in their own section specific for away teams.  People that are trained in alien terrain/adapting etc.  Combat, both armed and hand to hand.  Etc etc etc.

Now the ""obvious"" and probably main answer, is they wanted the cast members to be on the away teams, but they could just have easily had some of the cast members be in that division.  

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't take away from the show or anything, just struck me as odd and was wondering if there was an answer in all the lore/data etc.

Does Star Trek need this?

Discovery's budget is roughly $8 million per episode. TNG's budget was $1.3 million an episode. I'd argue that TNG has some considerably more memorable episodes than Discovery or Picard (And I happen to like Discovery!) due to the writing.

I'm not saying slash a Trek show to a million an episode. Any new show wouldn't get very far on a million an episode these days, but I do think if the budget was tighter, it'd result in relying more heavily on solid writing, rather than punctuating the story with something grandiose.

However I do wish it was bit longer and it would have done a lot of good to make it into a two part episode. The episode we do have builds and builds.  It introduces Khan ,it has him interact with the rest of the crew, and ultimately his take over of the ship.  However once it seems he has 'won' he loses pretty quick.  Kirk is able to retake the Enterprise in almost no time at all.  It would have been better to end on a cliff hanger than have an entire episode about retaking the ship.

Fishy1701,1615594712,m3uyou,13,1,"Ive noticed a few people are on their first watch of the 90s series so wanted to warn. 

Im just doing a ds9 rewatch and i had forgotten how efficient dominion transporters were. They could reach several light years. The federation recovered a dominion ship mid series and even gul dukat in 2375 had access to one. The tech was all over cardassian space at the end of the war as well.

The federation had 800 years to advance their transporter technology far beyond that. But even assuming not a single advancement in 700 years the tech of 2375 was enough - so why couldent the federation function just as well without warp. Andor / Vulcan is closer to earth than Terok Nor is to Empok Nor so maintaining a chain link style transporter based federation would be entirely possible- the only reason ships were used to transport goods and people was because 23rd and early 24th century transporter tech was localised.  

By the 25th century all the major powers especially commerce based ones like the ferrengi alliance would have entire networks of transporters that just materialise anything  within the range of the entire federation and allied powers - 8000 light years in first contact (probably far larger by the 2900s) 

If anything starships by the 2600s - 2900s would be only for defence and science as they no longer function for the transport of good or sentients. So why was the burn such a hindrance? 

Actually just thinking a species voyager encountered could beam 35000 light years in 236? and the cube in Picard had the same tech undamaged in a central chamber that crashed on a world protected by the federation in 2399. Are they really not going to study a crashed cube?  

Is there an explanation i missed or in one of the comics or dvd ect that explains why the federation couldn't function without ships? Actually it was just dilithium so what about other tech like slipstream or bajorian solar sails - that thing hit warp 4 or 5 i think. 

Forget the solar sail thats kinda silly and might only work in between certain systems but what about the transporters? And other techs we have seen.

Matsu_Hanako,1615490983,m2ylmq,10,1,"I just finished the entirety of DS9...and it was very, very sad. The ending of TNG was sort of just...abrupt, so this ending was jarring and emotion-inducing. I cried. For sure. 

I was jarred and possibly a bit angry about Odo going off to live with the other changelings. I was very disappointed about this choice since Odo basically went through four or five similar character arcs, though it did make sense for his character. The only thing that did make me sad was that Kira and he had just gotten together (basically). So that was sort of a hammer to that subplot, even though their goodbye was beautiful. Also, Colonel Kira as the new station's Odo is a good touch. 

I can't believe that they would replace the magnificent Jadzia Dax with Ezri, who's just...I dislike Ezri. And by that I mean I really don't like her. I think I would have liked her better if they introduced her sooner, but she just didn't stick with me and was not a good replacement for Jadzia. But I guess I'm happy for Julian or whatever. 

Speaking of which, I love the bromance between Bashir and O'Brien. They make me so happy with their manchild bonding activities (not to mention that they remind me of Troy and Abed from Community). It was pretty heartbreaking when they broke up. But I liked it, and it was a good end to an amazing friendship. (Though I was pretty torn up about it.) 

And lastly, the Sisko part of the ending. Marrying Cassidy Yates was really sweet, but I still don't get it that the Prophets said that she would bring him to ruin? And that he needs to walk the path alone? Like, I understand, but how did she do that, exactly? Cassidy was obviously upset about it all, but Sisko didn't seem that fazed by the end of it. 

Also, they gave her a baby, just so that he would never see it? Furthermore,  why would they give Cassidy a baby, just so we show watchers would never see it? That makes me even sadder that DS9 is done. 

But I did enjoy the finale, even with my complaining. I always loved Dukat. And I still think...no never mind, I don't know who is my favorite captain: Picard or Sisko.

jeremy1015,1615481294,m2unmt,131,1,"The easiest way to start the notion of this is by reframing the [Epicurean paradox:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Epicurus)

Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.  
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?  
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? 

The first example:

Imagine a species like us... roughly similar IQs, but a few centuries of technology ahead. Imagine them watching us from a starship in 2021, parked in orbit around our planet but using their technology to prevent us from seeing them.

Imagine knowing that they have the medical technology to have come up with not only an effective treatment for COVID in a day, but a one shot vaccine to boot. And they sit there and watch. 

Who are they to sit there and not intervene as millions of sentient lives are snuffed out - often in agony - as their loved ones are forced to say goodbye over a remote viewscreen? Who are they to let an \*entire species\* suffer the mental health degradation brought on by a year of isolation? Who are they to say ""well, they haven't developed replicator technology yet, so I guess we can just let those less well off financially (remember when we were like that guys? lol) put their lives at risk preparing food and delivering it to the wealthier folks""

It would damn well be unconscionable and unjustifiable in the extreme. You might as well look at a six year old child with an ugly infection and say ""Well, she hasn't invented antibiotics, so we might as well let this progress to sepsis.""

The notion that a species of sentient beings need to suffer the right amount and make it through the other side is even more horrifying. It's a sort of patronizing arrogance that says ""If I suffered, you need to suffer too, never mind the fact that I never really suffered, but I definitely have historical records that say my ancestors suffered.""

There are terrible, horrifying implications there. Consider the second example:

Imagine being in the Federation as it is written, and imagine observing a planet that has hit a level of technology that clearly implies (I mean, you've been an observer of many species by now that hit this point) that they are going to eventually hit warp drive technology. They're every bit as smart as humans, just five hundred years back on the tech curve. Airplanes, sent a rocket to their moon, etc.

They are facing some sort of Great Filter level disaster. Maybe they didn't get climate change figured out fast enough, because they're a bit closer to their sun or their atmosphere had just a bit more CO2 to begin with than ours did. By the time they realize they have a problem, they're already headed to an irrecoverable accelerating cycle that will turn their planet into a Venus-like hotbox.

Do you let them all die? Along with their culture, their hopes, their dreams, and their aspirations?

What if most of the species is peaceful and even advocating for the sort of ""enlightened humanism"" of the Federation but the planet contains one warlike culture that's going to dominate and eradicate them? Like ""if the Nazis had won"" kind of a thing. Could you let such a Holocaust occur if you had the power to prevent it? Could you condemn an entire species of sentient beings for the actions of a small number?

The answer to that one is so obvious that it's addressed by the ancient Jews in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Consider, even, a third example, somewhat different from the other two:

Imagine coming across a planet where there is a species of clearly sentient Cro-Magnon like beings that have covered their planet and are just now settling down into agriculture in small pockets around their globe. You've looked into them and they are roughly the same as us in terms of intelligence.

How do you \*not\* interfere and accelerate their progress? Why sit back and let them discover slavery, suffer through their Genghis Khans and their Black Plagues and their racist imperial periods? You've already found a better way, and you know damn well that left to their own they might turn into something like The Borg or The Cardassians or who knows what else.

Even if you don't want to come down as conquering aliens and super mindfuck them, go scoop up a few thousand of them, take them off planet, and introduce them to the federation. It's absolutely absurd to believe that the vast majority of them wouldn't get the picture pretty quickly. Let a generation of them live as at-large members of the Federation, and then have them go back down to their planet, set up some high tech bases, and let them teach their own bloody species everything they've learned.

And before you say this third example smacks of the exact cultural arrogance that the Prime Directive exists to prevent, allow me to issue two points in rebuttal:

1. The notion that the Federation believes that all cultures are of equal value is at best them talking out of both sides of their mouth. They judge new spacefaring species all the time and make the decision about whether they are ""worthy"" of joining the Federation. That implies that the Federation does, in fact, believe that their culture is superior and that other species would be better off joining them in their brotherhood of species.
2. The very notion that all cultures are created equal smacks of the worst kind of western absurdism. It's the kind of notion you can only hold dear to your heart if you are willing to stand by and let any amount of human rights atrocities occur without raising your voice and saying it's wrong. You can't say all cultures are created equal and then turn around and complain about Blood Diamonds. You get one or the other, you can't have both.

Anyway, just thinking lately about how our species might actually fuck ourselves up to the point where we don't make it out into space, and it got me to thinking about how severely I would judge an alien species that was watching us and ""waiting for us to mature."" 

It's racism at its worst to judge humanity by the concentration camps in China, or the anti-science nuttery that's made its way through social media lately. In conclusion, I hereby declare independence from the Federation and I'm going to make my own Federation, with blackjack and hookers.",startrek,"After thinking about the last few years of human history, I have come to the conclusion that the Prime Directive is at best misguided arrogance, and at the worst downright moral idiocy.",6349,1106,5.7405063291139244

I was reminded last night that some of my favorite moments with him in ST involve food:  in 'Revulsion', as a murderous hologram, he confronts B'elanna about how disgusting eating is from his perspective, what with the grinding of bits of plant and animal matter with teeth, using saliva to wash it down into the stomach, where stomach acids start to dissolve the remains---'so disgusting you humans can't even stand to think about it!'.  Creepy and menacing stuff.  And then in ENT, he plays the sleazy alien-collaborator in ""Carpenter Street"", where he insists on getting some fast food, much to the distaste of T'Pol.  IIRC, he even spills some of his burger or french fries on her, and she is unbelievably disgusted and uncomfortable.  I know he shows up in DS9 too.

Filming is now imminent and would have likely begun already were it not for COVID...and yet all we know are three actors as three chracters that we've already seen them play. Now, admittedly my memory is a little rusty when it comes to character/casting announcements from previous series/seasons but it feels like compared to those we should know a great deal more at this stage in the game.

There is a post on the front page about potential for Scotty and I've seen similar speculation regarding the return/recasting of legacy characters. It just seems strange to me that despite how close we are to filming we don't even know more. I would have a cast list, crew names, or both at this point. If nothing official, I would have at least expected leaks or unconfirmed but likely rumors.

So am I way off base in my thinking timeline wise? Are they purposefully holding things back till late in the game? If so, why? Avoid backlash? Surprise fans? Some kind of ""event"" announcement? Perhaps there isn't much to say and it will be less of an ensemble than 90's Trek and the remaining cast will be less important supporting characters while Pike, Spock, and Number One will mirror the Kirk, Spock, McCoy leading trio.

What bothers me about Discovery and what fundamentally separates it from all other Star Trek shows is that the epistemology and moral compass of the show is totally missing, which are the core of Star Trek. 

On every other Star Trek show, The Original Series, Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, Picard, the crew would be present with a hard moral choice or quandry.     They'll struggle with it.  The Captain will lead this struggle, carefully weight what's happening,  apply morality and ethics and logic,  and try to do the right thing in a bad situation.  

Sometimes they make a mistake, and they end up being wrong,  but they've always worked together, in at least attempted unity as a crew (with the Captain leading them)   and what always makes them carry the day is carefully weighing what's wright and wrong, really struggling with that choice and challenging what they think is true,  and confronting their own mistakes or shortsightedness. 

on Discovery, that doesn't happen.   Instead, a problem arises, and Burham is always right.   She'll have an instant, gut-reaction to a situation, decide that she's right,  and if anyone tells her otherwise (or, god forbid,  the Captain tells her to stop and gathering information or proceed with cuation)  she'll mutiny, go lone-wolf,  dash off on her own and make unilateral decisions that affect everyone...

And always end up being right anyway.   Her recklessness and an impatience and shortsightedness always end up getting rewarded because she gets proven right.    The Captain (whoever it is)  and all her other crewmates (and maybe even every other character on the show) only exist to tell her ""no"" so she can defy them and then end up being right all along. 

It's basically a show that glorifies rushing off and making irrational decisions without all the facts.   Her first gut-reaction is always the right one and she just spends the rest of the hour slowly being proven right by the story.     This happens over and over,  every episode.    (with the only exceptions being the episodes that weren't about her) 

It feels disingenuous and unfaithful to the core ideas of Star Trek, which were about hard, careful moral choices, about teaching us (The audience)  about the virtues of patience, empathy,  keeping an open mind, and seeing the humanity and value in others, and learning from our mistakes.  

Every Burnham story instead feels like a narcissistic fantasy where only she knows the right way and every other character is just an obstacle to her being proven right. 

I'm not saying this out of ignorance, either.  I've watched just about the whole series.  I'm currently on episode 8 of the 3rd season, but who knows, maybe things will change by the end of the 3rd, but I doubt it. 

But this is the core of, the whole ""It doesn't feel like a Star Trek Show"".    It's this, not any of the other superficial stuff that people complain about.     It's that, fundamentally, this is not a show about struggling with hard moral choices or learning how to see other people as human beings who have value, like every other Star Trek show.  

Instead,  the show is a solipsistic fantasy about one character.",startrek,I figured out what really bothered me about Star Trek: Discovery,3311,553,5.987341772151899

To explain; I‚Äôve just recently gotten seriously into the Star Trek franchise and I‚Äôve been watching Deep Space Nine. For starters I thought that they would continually have a new race come aboard the station and have to deal with them similarly to how The Next Generation did. I was pleasantly surprised by how detailed DS9 gets with the culture of the Bajorans, Trill, Ferengi, and Cardassians. Learning about the history and lore of these seemingly major players in the universe makes for an amazing show! 

With my general praise for the show out of the way I‚Äôd like to say that when it comes to the various aliens of the show I do like for them to appear more ‚Äòalien‚Äô but not too much. Bajorans basically seem human with the exception of their ridged noses (if there is any other difference I haven‚Äôt noticed) and Cardassians have so many differences to humans visually that they seem almost insect like to me. But seeing the result of these two species smooshing their respective reproductive organs together makes me hope they can improve relations! It‚Äôs like the perfect blend of the two. Just enough differences to show she‚Äôs an alien while still having a hint of familiarity with her features that wouldn‚Äôt frighten off humans if she were to be the one we made first contact with. 

Now I haven‚Äôt seen much of her yet (I‚Äôm only on season 4 episode 21 and I haven‚Äôt even finished the episode) so I do hope I get to see more of her personality in future episodes! So far she seems to at least have a decent head on her shoulders. She was the one to ask Garak out which shows that she doesn‚Äôt expect the man to do everything (a trait I personally love because boy howdy am I shy as heck). She loves her family (even though it‚Äôs Dukat) which I believe is important. I will say she doesn‚Äôt have to and I wouldn‚Äôt hold anything against her character if she did hold some grudge against Dukat for nearly killing her, but she still loves him. 

I know this whole post may seem somewhat excessive for a fictional character, but I love doing these sorts of deep dives/examinations of characters from shows!

Holograms are synthetics too and there exists at least one sentient hologram, The Doctor (has he called himself Joe yet?). The Romulans in Picard didn't seem to particularly care what *form* a sentient AI took, but seemed lazer focused on Soong-type androids in the series even though holograms were more than obviously ever present.

While I get the focus of Picard was to highlight the relationship between Picard and Data, ignoring Holograms seems to be a huge oversight! Voyager had at least a handful of episodes showing sentient Holograms (even beyond the Doctor). If the Romulans were so against sentient AI, they would have attacked holograms as well (causing Star Fleet to have included them in the ban). I find this especially irritating as they bright 7of9 into the show! If this was going to be a fight for the rights of synthetics to exist, then how much better would it have been if, while Picard was trying to find/save Soji, Seven was trying to find/save the Doctor as well! 

Even if you want to say sentient holograms are somehow different when speaking of ""synths"" than Soong-type androids are, at least acknowledge this in some fashion! Humans are hypocrits all the time, especially about exclusion of races, so, fine, Holograms are safe... at least bring that up. Make a case for Soong-types to be a greater threat.

Atheissimo,1615218450,m0ii8s,9,1,"Just a thought I've always had about a potentially different direction DS9 could have gone, but didn't:

DS9 sets up a conflict between Jem'Hadar bred in the Alpha quadrant and those bred in the Gamma quadrant in the episode One Little Ship, then never mentions it again.

I'd have loved it if the Alphas decided to stop worshipping the Founders and joined the cult of the Pah Wraiths, going rogue and setting up their own faction based on freedom for the Jem'Hadar, ruled by Gul Dukat. They think they're better than the Gammas and that their Founder gods have failed them, and it's only through allying with the Pah Wraiths that they can take their place as a dominant species in the Galaxy. Maybe the Pah Wraiths can even use their timey wimey magic to cure them of addiction to the white, cementing their place as gods and giving Jem'Hadar a reason to join them.

This could have been seeded by showing strange Dominion activity like mysterious battles and destroyed outposts, and the appearance of Pah Wraith cult sites among the Jem'Hadar as the Vorta lost control of them, which would have been an intriguing little mystery to solve, with the big payoff coming at the Battle of Deep Space Nine.

Rather than having the Prophets deus ex machina the whole thing by destroying the Dominion fleet in the wormhole, they could have had a large part of the Alpha fleet go rogue in the battle and attack the Gammas as they come through, doing enough damage to neutralise their threat before warping off to Empok Nor.

It would have given Dukat something to do and the little tribe of followers he always wanted, as well as a sensible motivation beyond moustache twirling evil. It would have given the Pah Wraith threat a form rather than shady cultists and glowy balls of light, and it would have paid off all the angst about the place of the Jem'Hadar as sentient beings in their own right.",startrek,Missed opportunity in DS9 (*spoilers*),1890,335,5.641791044776119

captaincreideiki,1615172975,m06f08,1,1,"Another redditor [just posted about](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/m027ng/in_sons_of_mogh_ds9_worf_and_bashir_wipe_worfs/) how cringe-inducing the ending to DS9's ""Sons of Mogh"" is. And, frankly, I have to agree. However, when reading through that post and comments, I developed an idea about the episode that makes me feel very differently about it. I've come to the conclusion that, if not for a few missed storytelling opportunities. ""Sons of Mogh"" *should have been a great episode*. Prepare yourself for a TL;DR -- I'm in quarantine and have nothing better to do. :)

&amp;#x200B;

To start, ST:DS9 4x15 ""Sons of Mogh"" is a callback to ST:TNG 5x15 ""Ethics."" Both show how Worf's worldviews and attitudes have been changed by his time in the Federation. In ""Ethics,"" Riker refuses to help Worf commit ritual suicide -- just as Worf refuses to help Kurn in ""Sons of Mogh"" -- and eventually another option presents itself. Worf undergoes an untested and risky procedure that will either restore motor function or result in his death. In the long-run, Worf is grateful that his shipmates aboard the Enterprise convinced him not to undergo Hegh'bat, and he goes on to live many more glory-filled years.

&amp;#x200B;

The missed opportunity in ""Song of Mogh"" is that there's no actual callback. No one ever mentions the events of ""Ethics."" Worf never sits Kurn down and tells him about the time he was paralyzed. Sure, they talk about how Worf lived in dishonor, for the sake of the Empire, for years, but no one mentions the time that he faced a life-changing back injury and asked a friend (a friend that Worf considered to be a brother!) to help him with a ritual suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

There are clear similarities. Like Worf's shipmates in ""Ethics,"" Worf enlists the help of his colleagues to find another option for Kurn. Like Worf, Kurn struggles with the ideas they come up with. Just as Worf could not envision a life worth living without the use of his legs, Kurn cannot envision a life worth living without his honor. Eventually, in both episodes, a radical and risky idea is presented, one that will give each a chance to find a life worth living. Here again, however, ""Sons of Mogh"" misses an opportunity: there's no scene where Worf and Kurn discuss the mindwipe, no scene where they talk about the tradeoffs. We can *assume* that Kurn consented to this, but we never see it. Which is shame in  part because Tony Todd plays Kurn and would have nailed that scene, and in part because this non-existent scene could have placed this episode at the heart of a major theme in TNG *and* DS9: the Klingon Empire's struggle with its own identity.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout TNG and DS9, we see the Klingon Empire at an inflection point. Positions of power are held by corrupt politicians, the Empire's centuries-long expansion has halted, the alliance with the Federation has brought about an unprecedented (and for many, deeply unwelcome) era of peace. Holding to the old ways will eventually lead to the Empire's demise, but surviving in this new age would mean abandoning some traditions. The Empire can either double down and perish, or it can change its ways and survive. What is at stake for the Empire, either way, is its *identity*. To hold fast, unchanging, and die, or to change, at least in part, and survive.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, ""Sons of Mogh"" fails to make the connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking the episode as part of the broader storytelling arc of TNG and DS9, rather than a one-off episode, it is *powerful*. Many in the Empire view Worf's way of life as a perversion and a corruption of traditional Klingon society; they would rather die than change their ways. In ""Ethics,"" we see Worf struggle as his values clash with Federation values, and Picard helpfully explains that, for Worf, ""the road between"" ritual suicide or living without use of his legs ""covers a lifetime of values, beliefs."" Here, Kurn is facing that same dilemma: Kurn ""can't make the journey"" that Worf is asking of him. Even two sentences about this experience from Worf would have been a brilliant callback.

&amp;#x200B;

Kurn's identity is partly personal; he has a life, a family, personal honor. But the bedrock of his identity is his identity as member of a group. Klingons value their identity *as Klingons* in a way that Federation civilizations often have trouble fully grasping. The choice that Kurn faces (or, that he should have faced -- again, we have to assume that he was presented with the choice and consented to the mind-wipe), is to trade a *part* of his identity in order to continue living *as a Klingon*.

&amp;#x200B;

The Empire faces the same conundrum: to sacrifice a *part* of its identity in order to survive. This arc was prominent throughout TNG and one of the central themes of DS9. ""Sons of Mogh"" *should* stand as a poignant episode in that arc. Instead, we are left  wondering whether or not Kurn even agreed to the procedure. And that lack of consent, that lack of consideration, that lack of Kurn *making a choice*, guts  the poignancy that this episode should have had.

&amp;#x200B;

Had the writers made the point just a little more clear, that Kurn is trading a *part of his identity* (not his whole identity; the way of life of a Klingon, his membership in that society, that bedrock part of Kurn's identity, would actually be *preserved* through this procedure) for a chance at a life worth living, and made it clear that Kurn considers the risks and decides that he was willing, I believe this the episode would have resonated as one of the best of the series, perhaps even the franchise. Worf offers Kurn a drastic and risky alternative to an honorable death: he offers him a way to live. And, as Picard said in ""Ethics,"" ""a Klingon may not be good at accepting defeat, but he knows all about taking risks.""

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of *two entire series*, Worf convinces the Empire to make choice that Kurn *should* have been allowed to make for himself: to sacrifice a part of its identity for the chance at a new life. This choice *defines* Klingons in the TNG/DS9/VOY era. What a shame that ""Sons of Mogh"" doesn't make that connection.",startrek,"Why DS9's ""Sons of Mogh"" should have been a great episode",6201,1054,5.883301707779887

Mr_Westerfield,1615168054,m04zag,15,2,"I recently watched *A Piece of the Action*, and it really exceeded my expectations. Going into the episode, I was expecting campy, stupid fun, with everyone dressing up in pinstripe suits and talking in bad 1920s slang. There is a lot of that, certainly. You can‚Äôt help but laugh at the way there are just pedestrians casually walking down the street with Tommy Guns everywhere. But what really got me was how well it works on an intellectual level.

You, see, despite the goofy premise, it actually has a solid theme: the importance of being able to adapt yourself to the worldviews of others and work within their system of values, no matter how strange they seem. Even though the fact that the Iotians almost border on cartoon villains, Kirk and Spock never talk to them. On the contrary, they constantly note how ingenious the Iotians are, and quickly realize that, in their way, they have an accurate diagnosis on what‚Äôs wrong in their society and how to fix it. While they initially have a difficult time understanding the Iotians inverted system of ethics, they don‚Äôt dismiss, but rather try to work within it to devise a solution that fits the Iotians cultural norms. This might seem like a bit of a broken aesop at first, since Kirk ends up strong arming the Iotians. But what he‚Äôs really doing is playing the game as they‚Äôd want it played.

In short, it‚Äôs a wonderful example of the show‚Äôs open minded philosophy.

My only regret is that nobody ever followed up on the stinger at the end, where they left a communicator behind and joked that the Iotians might use it to invent a warp drive. How great would it have been if the Iotians had shown up 100 years later at DS9 or something.

I've had the same reaction to most pop things in geek and nerd culture. In fact, my default position of 'nerds always overhype. It can't be that good' held up pretty well. Until started watching TOS that is. Star Trek to me is above and beyond the wildest praise that has been laid on it. The way the narrative stretches, the concepts. It's everything I want in a series.  This is one of the few series where the story is the protagonist and the actors are the tools. Star Wars, Marvel, DC and what have you all revolve around a person or a group of people. Star Trek, so aptly named, is the stories and boy am I here for it. Why aren't you folks as rabid about Star Trek as other fanbases are? I could've got to watching it long before if you were. But this is a good thing, I guess.

I've been browsing the catalog of a company you know that makes tiny starships and one thing I've noticed is how a lot of the ships of the nuEra seem to lack...dimension. The Discovery is a (arguably, I know) handsome ship, but it is kind of flat. So is the Kerala, the Shenzou, the Shran and a bunch of other. It was a design choice, I guess, but the saucers look so thin compared to, say, the Enterprise.  Even the Klingon ships (the Qoj and the Qugh classes) are just kinda flat.  Even the nacelles are just boxy and flat, which is somewhat unprecedented. 

Also, the Zheng He--the USS Copy-and-Paste from Picard--is just really weird. Now that we have more images (and a teeny tiny ship model), it is a strange, Non-Euclidean ship whose dimensions promise  eldritch horrors. From most angles, except directly above, it looks almost asymmetrical.

Cagliostro2,1614894106,lxw756,13,5,"This is a crazy idea but

I really do think the internet has fundamentally altered human civilization, and the period of lightning fast tumult we've entered won't slow down for many generations until essentially every major institution has been reformed for this new mode of human interaction.  Government, schools, medical, its all a matter of time (the only question is whether or not we can survive til then).  

Now, that being said - it occurred to me that the way the internet has swept across the globe?  It reminds me of the way the Prime Directive gets violated.  As far as I know the US government and military are the ones that developed the internet and turned it into what it is today.  And then that advanced level of technology is disseminated to every culture on earth - whether or not that culture is capable of responsibly handling it (which is not to say that America is ready or responsible!).

Ragman1992,1614889768,lxue6o,66,61,"One of the most common types of post I have seen on the sub lately relate to how much fans have come to appreciate Enterprise particularly the final two seasons. I myself love the show. The interactions between Archer, Trip, and T'pol are all fantastic and side characters such as Shran and Soval are fantastic additions to the show! I understand there have previously been campaigns to renew the show that have failed but why not try again? CBS has developed and is currently developing so many new Trek projects (Discovery, Picard, Brave New Worlds, Lower Decs,etc..) why not make make a petition &amp; subsequent campaign to  get a proper conclusion?  Think about the possibilities. We never had a chance to visit Denobula, explore the full extent of the Romulan/Federation conflict, explore the direct events leading up to the formation of the federation &amp; we never got a chance to see fleshed out storylines for Hoshi/Travis/Malcolm.

&amp;#x200B;

Things Working in our Favor:

1. All the Actors/Actresses are still alive and I'm positive they would enjoy coming back in some capacity. Many have expressed bad feelings regarding the shows ending and the possibility of a proper conclusion to show would be appealing.
2. CBS is looking for creative new avenues to explore and ways to gain fan approval what better way than giving fans a proper conclusion to a series that has become increasingly popular on streaming platforms.
3. It's possible that aged versions of the Enterprise crew could make Cameos or have connections to discovery or Brave New Worlds.

Perhaps this idea has all ready been explored before but I felt compelled to make this post considering all the positive posts about Plox, Trip, the show itself, and the sadness over the potential storylines that were never developed due to the shows cancelation. Brining shows back with satisfying conclusions is possible just look at what r/TheExpanse did!

All the responses to this post have been great. I had not even considered the possibility of finishing the series using animation, or considered the possibility of concluding the series with a movie.

Would locals, say roughly the equivalent of Bajorans, be allowed to open shops there?  And how would UFP citizens pay for such exchanges?

choicemeats,1614870404,lxmjm4,10,10,"One of my favorite idiosyncracies of our beloved franchise is despite looking forward to our future, the show is still a product of the time it was made in.

Some of my favorites include:

- P2P communication: Writers came up with sub-space as a way to communicate over vast distances almost instantaneously, but did not scale it down to a shipboard wifi network. Sure you could send messages or date from one console to the next, but Riker is still handing over a padd (""his"" padd?) to Picard for approval instead of a wireless interaction.

- Media and Social Media: The Doctor totes his holoimager around like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Meanwhile, the show ended a few years before the short rise and fall of the digital point and shoot (supplanted almost immediately by both the iPhone and also affordable, higher scale photography gear for the masses). Does anyone in Trek have anything similar to the imager? Or do they find them pointless where you could create your own landscape in the holodeck, or internal sensors can create a more accurate, higher quality image. After all, how do they monitor security footage? Similarly, people communicated face to face a lot, which is much easier in a contained space like Voyager. But what about if Geordi wants to slide into DMs from some woman from Risa--does he have to wait for a dedicated comm window for them to chat? Is the long distance relationship kind of difficult or dead? Today it's hard to fathom *not* texting anyone or being informed about their lives via social media. Or what if B'Lanna wants to mess with Vorik--can she text him on his padd or console?

LowerDecks has kind of retconned this, showing Mariner frequently messaging using her padd

-  Holodecks and personal entertainment: I liken holodeck time like a trip to the movies--between all their work plus the aliens that make their lives difficult, its a nice getaway that would have a much more immersive experience than maybe 2D media or whatever hobbies they have (although the holodeck could harbor any hobby you can think of)...when you can get it. Two holodecks for 120ish people on Voyager? There's enough hours in a week for everyone, but everyone still has to work and sleep, so maybe there aren't. Do I have to wait two weeks for my next recurring holodeck time? Am I limited to what I can do in my quarters? Wait, what can I do in my quarters anyway?

**Deep Space Nine**

Bashir was 27 when DS9 started, Worf was 32 when he joined the crew, Odo was found 35 years prior to DS9, Jadzia was 28 when DS9 started, Sisko was 37 when DS9 started, O'Brien was 41 when DS9 started, the Dax symbiont is 346 when DS9 started, Kira Nerys was 26 when DS9 started.

Quark is harder as he has no official birth date, but we know that his Age of Ascension was 2351. We also don't know when Ferengi reach their Age of Ascension, but Nog tried to purchase his apprenticeship in Starfleet when he was 18, so let's assume it's roughly then. That means his date of birth is about 2333, meaning he's about 36.

**The Next Generation**

Picard is 59 when TNG starts, Riker is 29 when TNG starts, it is 26 years since Data's activation date when TNG starts, Troi is 28 when TNG starts, Tasha Yar is 27 when TNG starts, Worf is 24 when TNG starts, Geordi is 29 when TNG starts, Beverley Crusher is 40 when TNG starts, Wesley Crusher is 16 when TNG starts, Guinan is roughly 514 when TNG starts

**Voyager**

Janeway is 43 when VOY starts, Chakotay is 42 when VOY starts, Tom Paris is about 29 when VOY starts,  B'Elanna Torres is 25 when VOY starts, Seven of Nine is 24 when she is liberated in VOY, Tuvok is 107 when VOY starts, The Doctor is &lt;1 when VOY starts, Kes is 2 when VOY starts, Harry Kim is 22 when VOY starts",startrek,Characters in-show ages,1541,298,5.171140939597316

I started off thinking Sisko and Dukat are going to chat around the fire and rescue beacon until a ship shows up, with the roles reversed and some redemption for Dukat, but then twist! 

Dukat's been saved by the Dominion already and they're just toying with Sisko, but then twist!

Dukat's seeing people.  Ziyal's death really has hit him hard. Maybe he will off Sisko because he's not well in the head. 

Turns out, the rescue beacon wasn't transmitting after all, Sisko fixes it. The Defiant picks up two life forms on a planer, but twist!  It's not Sisko and Dukat.

Dukat gets his ""trial"" with ""Judge"" Sisko and to see Dukat's pretzel logic on display was amazing. (amazing performance) Since Sisko realizes Dukat's hallucinating, he takes his shot during Dukat's monlouge to attempt an escape. 

Why he didn't lift the phaser off Dukat and fully stun him is the only head scratching thing to me, but the plot required it.  Sisko was in a hurry in his injured state to leave I guess.

TorgoLebowski,1614704590,lw6wlu,6,1,"Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to really like here:  most of the cast is solid (Michelle Yeoh is always a treat!) and the new additions in season 2 are really great (Spock, Pike), the writing is usually pretty good, the visual effects are often terrific to spectacular, the serialized plot works for me, Season 2 is much improved from Season 1 (I'm just finishing Season 2), etc..  Sure, there are some flaws (yes, too much crying, the romantic arcs tend to be slow and plodding, still not sure if I like these very alien Klingons, etc.), but considering I'm only in Season 2, these are minor quibbles and most ST franchises are still finding their footing in their 2nd season.  

So why am I just 'trying to enjoy' it?  It has everything to do with the absolutely terrible way that CBS All Access is editing it.  That is, they are 'missing' the ad breaks.  When a scene is building to a climax, CBS will cut into it about 5-10 seconds too early, jarringly cutting to a several minute long commercial break (weird pharmaceuticals, and endless flogging of Paramount +), and then when DISC comes back on, we get the last 5-10 seconds of the dramatic scene we left a few minutes before, now devoid of its dramatic impact, and then that scene ends and then there is the obvious spot where a commercial break is supposed to happen.  It completely destroys the impact of so many of these scenes---Burnham is struggling and about to be killed, whoops, let's cut to a commercial, when we come back we get the last few seconds of that dramatic fight; or Pike is making a heartfelt speech and the music is swelling and bam!  jagged cut to commercials, when we come back, and we get the last few (now dramatically neutered) moments of the heartfelt speech, etc., etc..

Discovery in season 3 is after the temporal cold war, but the events of the temporal cold war are blurry at best. If there were any types or humans that would cause havoc in the humans ranks during a temporal cold war it could be Napoleon-esc genetically modified beings like we saw in Khan, or part of section 31. Two things that Bashir has ties to from Ds9.

Bashir would be perfect as that vessel to tell the story of the people who would have fought those who would try to effect the timeline. Many episodes involve Bashir talking about the importance of protecting the timeline, and had content with section 31 and the time agents. Along with his high security clearance in star fleet it all makes him a possible choice.

There are multiple ways Bashir could be a part of this distant future as well. Being a time traveler stuck in the future is doable, but that is already the Discovery's plot arc.

Official_N_Squared,1614459271,ltx3ks,19,26,"Ok hear me out. We recently got a look at the bridge crew of Star Trek: Prodigy. In case you haven't seen it: [https://i.imgur.com/h46CQan.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/h46CQan.jpg)  


Probably the most striking thing about this image is that I didn't have the foggiest idea what species any of these people are. Now every Star Trek has introduced a new race or two in the main cast before but I don't think anybody expected this. I'm interested to see where it goes but the comments to the OP that brought this to my attention recognized 2 species. One is the big rock guy from beta cannon, cool but not important. But what I want to focus on today is 2nd from the left. The general consensus seems to be that that guy is a Talaxian, and I agree.

We know this series takes place sometime during Janeway's lifetime. I know there's a theory floating around that it's the far future and she's a hologram but given the title of this post you can imagine I'm ganna ignore that idea here. There's just not really evidence for it.

From this article: [https://www.startrek.com/news/breaking-star-trek-prodigy-first-look](https://www.startrek.com/news/breaking-star-trek-prodigy-first-look), we also know this group of ""six young outcasts ***know nothing*** about the ship they have ***commandeered***... but over the course of their adventures together, they will each be ***introduced*** to Starfleet and the ideals it represents. Kate Mulgrew was previously announced as reprising the iconic role of Captain Kathryn Janeway to ***lead*** this brand new¬†*Prodigy* bridge crew.""

Now if this series takes place in the alpha/beta quadrant near Federation space how do you NOT know anything about the Federation or Starfleet? Clearly these people are aware of other alien races, and the Talaxians should probably know about Starfleet if this is a post-Voyager show. Especially if they can get to the Alpha/Beta quadrant somehow. And there's the key, we know they can't. Or at least we can be VERY confidant that they can't do that.

Voyager, S7ep25, Endgame. The USS Voyager returns home to Earth in the year 2394 (5 years after ST: Picard). This means at the absolute earliest Starfleet developed the technology to reach the Delta quadrant in 2394 to get Voyager and bring them home. Except, 2404, Janeway goes back in time after 10 years dedicated to trying to get Voyager home early. And what does she do? (Warn Janeway about an attack on Mars/Roulan supernova? Wait no that's a topic for another thread.) Does she just hand young Janeway the schematics to a transwarp drive or whatever advanced propulsion was developed to get home? No because none exists. And that's with old Janeway dedicated with trying to get Voyager home. In the ""real"" timeline I doubt anyone in the Federation is trying to reach the Delta quadrant. The Romulan supernova would have taken up everybody's time and the great journey to the Delta Quadrant isn't mentioned in Picard.

Plus this is Captain Janeway we're talking about. Captain ""I never violated the Prime Directive"" Janeway. If there was any way she could return a commandeered Starfleet vassal to Earth she would do it. Or at least contact the Federation. So why didn't she? Why is she out on this ship alone with 6 kids?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in the mid 24th century a Federation starship goes missing, presumed destroyed. (Bonus points if it's one we know like the one Geordi's mom was on.) In reality it was taken by the caretaker and ended up somewhere in the Delta quadrant, crew dead. Either it is stolen and makes it's way to the Prodigy crew or it never made it all the way to the array and lands near their system. But somehow between the years of 2371 and 2377 it does. Meanwhile Captain Janeway has been in the Delta Quadrant for 1-7 years now and is on a solo mission to the planet McGuffin to secure parts to finally be able to replicate photon torpedoes or something who cares. She will be away from Voyager and out of coms range for some time and will rendezvous with them at a scheduled date weeks in the future.

However everything changes when she finds the unbelievable: another Federation starship, noticeably older the Voyager. She is even more dismayed to find a crew of teenagers form unknown species, save for a Talaxian. Clearly this crew is not from the Federation. She knows she can't have a Federation starship crewed by six random teenagers  in the Delta quadrant. ""The Federation stands for something. It stands for ideals an principles which embrace cooperation and mutual freedom for all life forms. They don't let just anybody serve on these ships."" she tells the crew. And they do not understand. The Delta Quadrant is a harsh and fractured quadrant (much like a lot of the world these days). These kids have no reference for these ideals. Cooperation? Trust? Something more then themselves? What could all that mean? All they've ever known is a life of hardship and having to work hard for everything you need, not be given it.

Janeway knows she can't take the kids with her, and she can't just leave them out here. So she decides to stay with them and take the ship to Voyager or their homeworld or whatever. But the journey will take awhile, and along the way ""they will each be introduced to Starfleet and the ideals it represents."" By the end of the first season the kids learn the value of friendship and cooperation and what it means to be part of something like the Federation. Meanwhile Janeway realizes the Federation isn't about Starfleet or training or even being a Federation citizen. It is about ideals and core values that these kids have come to embrace and live by. She feels confident leaving them with their ship in the knowledge they will represent the Federation just as well as any Starfleet crew she has ever seen. Janeway returns to Voyager, End season 1.

The entire season took place in one of the gaps between Voyager episodes where they reference species and events we never saw.

geraltofrivia783,1614423038,ltlnvd,40,3,"A ongoing theme within the universe is that characters behave within close confines of what their species is expected to do. Its easy to draw parallels from this to race oriented stereotype in our world. Apart from humans, the most defining aspect of every character, of how they would act normally or under pressure--is their race. I believe there was some mumbo jumbo about it in the last/second last season of Enterprise as well - the fact that humans can be as logical as vulcans, passionate as X, etc., and are thus uniquely positioned amongst all the species. 

Case in point: TNG Season 3, Episode 19 - an exhausted Picard is on vacation at Risa, where a Ferengi confronts him about something. His response: ""You'll find that Ferengi demands carry very little weight with me."" I could write this off as just him expressing federation's technological superiority over the Ferengis but I think it is a representative of how the audience is expected to think of _all_ of them.

All too commonly characters claim ""your species is too weak"", ""your species is too barbaric"", and so on. I find it slightly unsettling, and a bit problematic. Rarely do individuals to determine their behaviour, and act out of the box their species has been type-casted as.

A 1950s TV style courtroom drama, with fashion that nods to Shatner's twilight zone days.  All the cameos in the world can be explored, from the movies to TOS villains, and even nods to the novels. 

As what seems to be an imminent conviction grows nearer Kirk begins to piece the true nature of his existence--he is an imprint of Kirk's consciousness, trapped in the nexus, which is about to tear apart a thriving three-planet colony (so we can intercut some starship action with a small cast of new characters), and where locals have reported sightings of the late Starfleet hero dismissed as ghost stories or a disrespectful conspiracy theory of some kind.  Kirk makes the ultimate sacrifice one more time, saving the planets by causing the nexus the breach and dissipate-- destroying the imprint in the process.  Which Kirk experiences as a window into all of the timelines and gets to deliver a tearful farewell to Spock, who appears to hear him, using leftover footage from Kelvin films.  

Epilogue has Shatner appearing to Pine in a dream/vision in the shipyard bar back in Iowa, suggesting he may have survived outside of the Nexus. It also might just mean Pine is now aware of his life in the other timeline because of the intersecting that happened when the nexus was breached, and lol you can't kill Kirk.

While none of us are 'trekkies', we thought jumping into the sci-fi world of Picard and his crew would be a great start to our adventure. So jump aboard the USS Enterprise (our podcast) and journey with us as we explore strange new worlds (TV shows).

scoopawaythrow,1614386642,ltc7gu,14,0,"Man I loved this episode. It was such a product of its time.

First off they kept using the word 'gender' as a synonymn for 'sex'. Because, you know, 99% of the time, up until very recently, gender was a synonymn for sex.

They kept mis-sexing the cogenitor. The aliens kept calling it an it, and I believe tpol corrected tucker and told him that it wasn't a 'she'. Archer did the same thing and kept calling it a she. Which, for me, I can totally relate with.  I really don't care about gender, I think it's super unimportant and outside of transgenders/sexuals, I don't think there should be nearly as many people obsessed with gender.

Third, we get a really good example of the prime directive in action. A solid explanation here. While our society would see the way these aliens are treated this cogenitor sex as cruel it's not our place to change it. When you see a fence in the middle of nowhere your first instinct should be to find out why it's there. Not to tear it down. Maybe Trip is right, maybe he's wrong, we really don't know and that's the point. We really don't know what's right or wrong unless we've walked a mile in someone else's shoes.

Lastly, my wife walked in the room when Bakula was going to chew out Trip. I stopped it and told her to check this shit out. This is the most angry Bakula will ever get. And he just falls -so flat.- Jesus. He's so bad.

I've been a Trek fan since the 90s and couldn't really get into TOS. I put this largely down to the fact that TOS is one of the planks for sci fi tropes we are so immersed with today and so to go back to those old episodes feels quaint and unsophisticated. I feel that way about City.

But this original script? Wow, I'm blown away by it's attempts to reach for something much more profound than what we got. I totally get why we didn't get that version of the episode but it's given me a new appreciation for the struggles that network television must have faced in those days.

scoopawaythrow,1614282768,lsf8dl,28,14,"I'm probably all wet on this one, but damn, it's so out of place and unnecessary. They got the 2 parter ending in the prior episodes. It was a fitting ending. It showed the beginnings of the Federation and you got the best acting performance of Tucker in the whole show. I almost teared up at the end when he was crying to tpol. 

Then they stick us with a 1-part ending when they decommission Enterprise... it's so bizarre. Riker and Troi show up for no apparent reason. They added nothing to the show except to contrast TNG with Ent. And contrast there was. Riker talking to the crew as the chef really showed how forced and hamfisted the actors of Ent really were. Riker was fluid and effortless, his cadence was fluid and spot on. Compared to the crew who just felt forced.

Then the story is just generic as fook. They brought back Shran, because everyone loves Jeffrey Combs- I have no complaints here about that-. You have Archer butting in again on an away mission, 'I wouldn't let you have all the fun!' yeah, no shit Scott Bakula, you do everything in the show. He literally has his hands in everything interesting or important. Give the spotlight to someone else for a change.

Then they kill Tucker for no reason, like, why was that necessary? It felt so hamfisted. They had a perfect ending previously leaving tpol and tucker's relationship ambiguous. Then they just deus ex machina in and say, 'ha-ha, all that sexual and emotional tension, all that psychic shit, the baby they cried over, and nothing happens between them and nothing will, Tucker dies.' What kind of bullshit is that?

It makes me almost think Bakula had something to do with it. Like he wanted Tucker to die so he couldn't get his own spinoff show and upstage him, because, lets be honest, Tucker upstaged the fuck out of Bakula at every turn.

Then, my favorite part is when you have the three captains of the enterprise reading the tagline, 'these are the voyages...' You have Picard who's voice and cadence is just so damn good. He's like Morgan Freeman, his voice is like the voice of god. Then you get Shatner who's an absolute icon. Very 1960's alpha male. Then finally Bakula who's just an absolute goober. I wonder how many takes they did of that and if they intentionally used the worst take, because he sounds so out of place.

I wouldn't trade the weekly discussions about the episodes for anything. They are what made the show enjoyable for me... finally getting to talk Star Trek with other fans again. That said, the structure just made for a better watch without the wait. The first three episodes flow together as a nice prologue. And some of the character decisions and arcs flow more nicely when watching episodes closer together.

Stardust City Rag still stands out like a sore thumb, though. And in my view, it weighs the show down and stunts its pace. The focus on Seven is cool, but she really didn't factor much into the rest of the show in a significant way.

He admits in the start of the episode that its a project to help him understand patients better and while he does become more involved/invested in it than he thought imo they never become real family to him and here is my reasoning.

His daughter has a terrible accident and is now dying, he tries to save her within the parameters of the program/experiment but beyond that tried to abbandon them, and then finally after speaking with tom paris to let it play out to completion. Thing is though if he genuinly cared for them he would not allow some arbitrairy moral opinion to prevent him from simply changing the program so that she is no longer injured, he essentially has Q-powers in this world hes made and rather than do everything at his disposal to save her he puts his own experience at an authentic human family ahead of her life.

To me that ether means 1. The writing was not good 2. Hes a sociopath 3. He never really saw them as a real family.

Ik and I'm overthinking it tbh I just wanted to see what everyone elses thoughts where on it. I think personally a MUCH better ending would have been that events are written so the tom paris rescue and death scene co-incide at the same point, after she dies the doctor says ""fuck it, shes more important"" and tries to change reality BUT the astral eddies outside damage the ship casuing some pwoer overload or whatever, and since hes trying to to re-write his daughters story at the time its her code/character data that becomes corrupted and is lost. Or if the writers had wanted to justify forgetting the doctors family existed (a repeated problem of voyager in a lot of things i know) the whole program could have been corrupted buy the surge with them all being erased, then you would have had a canonic reason for them never appearing again.

MedicalJelly,1614239690,ls1cio,7,12,"I just finished watching the voyager episodes about unimatrix zero, it inspired me for a borg origin theory (just for fun):

The borg was originally a society like humans and developed virtual reality world (unimatrix zero) that allows them to interact online.   
As the population demands to spends more time ""online"", they developed memory uploading, cybernetic and nano technologies. This gave them the ability to control their own body in the real world while they are ""online"".   
The nano technologies could be developed first to prolong their physical body before they were able to upload memories.  
So at this stage,  they still had individuals, and their own body became drones that they can control inside the online world.

When the memory uploading technology was completed, the original borg population became immortals. They might even had a online social structure, where the rich owns and controls many bodies as drones while the poor have single or no body and only exist virtually.  
Over centuries the elites of the immortal borg population continues to gain power, knowledge and pursue perfection, but each time they change themselves for perfection, they left behind things like emotion and empathy. The borg queen could be the current evolution of one of these immortal elites.  
And at somepoint during the borg evolution of ditching emotion, assimiliation technology was created so the elites can gather more power, knowledge and own more drones.

They didn't know exactly where they were going to go with the series right from the start thus the information we're giving at the beginning of the series which is a lot of about our characters backstory up till that point might not fully mesh with information we're giving later when the series had really gotten into its stride.

I will also say I'm sure many of you have made the same observation I'm new to this subreddit.

With all that out of the way let me make my point.

Ok so early in the series it is established that when Data was discovered people were unsure of his origin and this is reaffirmed several times throughout the series, what is often discussed alongside this is that he was a particular point of interest and study of many starfleet scientists.  Now it is not until during the series that Data discovers his origins to be that of a Soong android.

Now this is the obvious backstory and information we all know because that's what the series shows bluntly but what's never fully explained is why the hell did no one notice he was a soong Android based off the fact that he looks exactly like doctor Soong.  Soong was a renowned cyberneticist who was trying to create a positronic brain why on Earth would people who are studying the successful creation of such a thing not be aware of the person who famously got closest, and why would they not go back and look at his work and maybe a picture of the guy.",startrek,They should have realized that data was a soong android,1692,313,5.405750798722044

JeremyAPerron,1614211435,lrr26d,24,5,"There are a number of great articles around the web that discuss how the public in general has misperceived Captain Kirk in terms of being a rebel, a womanizer, or space cowboy etc.  I think these articles are spot on. When watching the original series Kirk reputation for violating the prime directive is also shown to be an exaggeration.  In most cases he has a legal excuse for doing so.  

Excuse #1 The Klingons or some pre-Prime Directive Earth ship has caused a mass interference with this culture's development.  The rules say I can correct the imbalance from prior interference so I am going to do that. Examples A Private Little War, A Piece of the Action

Excuse #2 Technically the Prime Directive only applies to *developing* cultures this culture is *stagnant*.  The computer that rules them will not allow the people to grow I am going to destroy it to free them to *develop* again.  Examples The Return of the Archons and The Apple

However there was one episode where the Kirk decided to forgo the prime directive because he just doesn't like what he sees.  That is  A Taste of Armageddon.  The two planets Eminiar VII and Vendikar have been at war for over 800 years.  They have sanitized it so that when attacks happen they are simulated by computer.  This way they have no physical damage but every one who was in the simulated attack now must commit suicide.  These two cultures are allowed to grow and continue with an acceptable causality list every year.  Kirk is appalled so he decides to destroy it.   In my review I wrote: 

&gt;You can try to make excuses and blame Fox for creating the situation or invoke the right of self-defense when Anan and the rest of Eminar tried to kill the crew of the Enterprise.   Those excuses however can only be used to justify the Kirk doing just enough to rescue the Ambassador and get back to the Enterprise and have an escape.  Kirk goes much farther than that he is altering the course of two neighboring worlds with a shared history.  He demands they change at gunpoint or he will destroy their civilization himself.  Captain Kirk has decided that there is something about this developing society that he does not like and has decided to change it, so much for the Prime Directive.

There was a Star Trek that mentioned this episode, I forget which book, but I remember in the novel Spock's father Sarek brings it up.  He states Starfleet Command and the Federation Council shared Kirk's feeling about how awful the situation was and decided to let it slide. (That tiny detail is another reason why the books can be awesome.)

It seems completely arbitrary for the Founders to make him Human of all possible species.

Odo is much more likely to view Bajorans as the ""default"" sci-fi species. Odo has lived among Bajorans for most of his life. His appearance is based upon a Bajoran's, hence why his face doesn't have the little indent between the brow ridge and the nose bridge that most humans have. Bajorans don't have that indentation; their nasal ridges run over it. Odo, not being skilled enough to actually form the ridges, has a smooth, straight, Bajoranesque nose. Furthermore, the Founders believe Odo's attachment to his Bajoran friend Kira Nerys to be the main reason for his wanting to be with Solids over them.

So why did they make him physiologically Human?

And in Pegasus, Riker is deeply troubled the moment he sees Pressman on the transporter pad right up until Picard lets him out of the brig.  Riker's mood in Voyages is nothing CLOSE to that, and the whole part of Deanna counselling him through making a decision to violate orders, what was that?  Why was the last Enterprise episode about Riker's little moral issue 200 years later?!?

And on Enterprise side of things, the whole story with Shran having his daughter kidnapped, and them catching up to the enterprise and Trip taking them out; that was so forced.  Trip should have died in Terra Prime.  There is no tension in the entire episode.  We know how it's gonna end.

Whenever I explain why something happens in a work of fiction, there is an ""in-story"" reason and an ""out-story"" reason.  The in-story reason explains why the event happened in terms of the narrative, whereas the out-story reason explains what the author wanted.


For instance, in the Star Trek TV series, Starfleet ships have no cloaking devices.  Only the Klingons and Romulans have them.  The in-story reason is that the Federation signed a treaty at one point in which they promised to never use cloaking tech in their ships.  The out-story reason is that the writers of the show felt that cloaking tech did not fit the honest and forthright character of the Federation; in the lead writer's words, the good guys ""don't sneak around"".

I really enjoyed Aaron Eisenberg‚Äôs scenes. He was absolutely incredible. It felt like I could have watched 5 hours of interviews with him.

I enjoyed learning various things such as the relationship between the actors Avery Brooks and Cirroc Lofton, who played Ben and Jake Sisko.

I also found it interesting that Michael Piller, a senior writer, introduced a process for screen play submissions for episodes, which helped to jump start a few writer‚Äôs careers.

I enjoyed seeing the remastered visuals for the space battle they shot.

However, there were a number of issues that I had with it.

It was way too pompous and self-serving. It felt like it was done so Ira could pat himself on the back, and circlejerk with others. I understand that it was Ira‚Äôs project, but it was way over the top.

They talked about why Terry Farrell left, and it was awful. It was mentioned that ‚Äúsome producer said if it weren‚Äôt for DS9 she would  be working at K-MART.‚Äù and quickly covered it up. Terry cried as she was talking about it, and it was difficult to watch especially to see how they covered for the producer. Rick Berman and his chamber-pot boys were the ones that harassed her about working at K-MART. She was also sexually harassed by Rick Berman. It was jarring.

The self-serving nature of the documentary also repeatedly touched on how progressive and feminist various aspects of the show were, which fell flat with the blatantly awkward coverup they did with Terry.

The documentary also only briefly mentioned Babylon 5 in some angry fan mail that Aaron Eisenberg read.

For too long, Discovery has been fighting an internal battle between being a show about Burnham, or being a show about its titular vessel. With Burnham stepping up to command, that conflict is potentially resolved. Most of the legitimate criticisms of Discovery stem from said conflict. Now the writers have the opportunity to make a show that is both about Burnham and about the ship without having to go to ridiculous lengths to justify one or the other.

For my story, I'd love to get a few interviews with Star Trek fans about their own personal story with Star Trek, and what drew them to the franchise and kept them engaged. 

I'm not looking for a specific demographic or reason for liking Trek, in fact, the more differences the better! Because this is an audio story, video chat isn't necessary, and I don't have to include your last name if it's something you're not comfortable with. 

I should also mention that this story isn't made to be published, it's an assignment, but I will still be treating it as a news story. Interviews would be conducted over Skype or Zoom with or without webcams, and will probably last no more than 15 minutes max. 

So! If you're a Star Trek fan who's interested in and willing to do a brief interview before the end of February, please comment below or DM me with your first name, age, and a brief synopsis of why Trek matters to you! I'll shoot you a message and we can set up an interview.

zen_mutiny,1614103283,lqonwz,95,18,"*Reposted because the old title may have been a bit misleading*


I have a few ideas for interconnected shows.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starfleet Academy**

I honestly have no idea how this one hasn't happened yet. It's pretty much a no-brainer, there's not much to explain here, except using previously established characters as some of the professors (and connective tissue to the prime universe: think O'Brien, Nurse Ogawa, and more) the idea of spinning off graduates/interns/cadets into ensemble roles in other shows. The cast should be somewhat fluid, especially as far as the faculty is concerned, bringing in guest lecturers who aren't necessarily permanent faculty, or some teachers only being temporarily assigned and possibly moving to other spinoffs as time goes on. Overall, I'd like Trek to explore the idea more that in a pseudo-military organization like Starfleet, people would move around a lot, instead of staying in the same post for seven years because an episodic business model demands it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starfleet Medical**

Another no-brainer. Think House meets Grey's Anatomy in space(ish). Starfleet Medical bigwigs like Crusher and Pulaski could have anything from cameos to major recurring roles. I, for one, think it would be fun to see these two interact, and more importantly, give Crusher more to do and more personality than TNG gave her. Students from the Academy series could show up as new graduates or as cadet/interns.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starfleet Corps of Engineers**

Same as the above, as far as Academy and prime timeline connective tissue goes, only here, expect the likes of O'Brien, LaForre, Torres, etc. Again, the legacy characters could be anything from cameos to major recurring roles, as the plot demands. Overall, as in all of these, I'd push the ensemble model as far as possible. Both the medical and engineering shows could mainly be procedurals with arcs, focusing on the biggest problems of the week in their respective fields. Maybe we could even see why O'Brien is the most important person in Starfleet.

Years ago, I got a physical board that used magnets so you could invert the attack boards.  I looked for rules and didn't find any I liked so I created my own.

A year ago I took the /r tridimensionalchess subreddit.  I did it because the pandemic had hit and I thought, why not?  It never got popular and honestly I don't think it will, but it's there.

Now, I got TTS on sale and looked for Tridimensional Chessboard.  They existed and were pretty but all the comments would complain that they were non-functional.  No one had made a functional tridimensional chessboard.

So I've done it myself.

The code is rough and I don't think TTS was made to create true three dimensional play BUT it works.

You can:

* select a piece then select a square to move the piece to that square
* select a piece then select another piece of opposite color to take the piece.  The taken piece ends up under the board; I may create an area where these go later.
* Select an attack board peg that has an attackboard over and under it to select it, then select another peg to move it.  The pieces moves with the board.

I may have my own rules but I made the board independent of those.  You can play how you want.  I'm very happy with how it turned out and just wanted to share it with the world.",startrek,I created a working TriDimensional Chess Board in Table Top Simulator,1492,248,6.016129032258065

RawrSean,1613981125,lpineh,17,1,"Hello everyone. I wanted to post an update to my [post from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ljh44v/new_to_the_whole_series_which_next/) where I asked for some help getting through what I now know were some really troubled episodes.

So, at the time of posting, I had finished Voyager and was feeling quite distraught. I made it through about 10 episodes of TNG, and a few of DS9. I really had no idea where to go from there. I was sad when Voyager ended, but could not find interest in the other series. I turned to you guys, and I have to say, you really, really came through. I cannot thank you guys enough. Covid has been really rough guys, I really needed something to do. You guys have no idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without further ado, lets dive:

I had no idea that early episodes in StarTrek are pretty much universally trash. I decided to start over because I had no idea what was going on. I didn't pay a lot of attention evidently. I utilized two ""Skip lists"" -- [the first, from a long time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1769mz/need_advice_on_watching_tng_over_again/c82lmr5/) and [the second, from my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ljh44v/new_to_the_whole_series_which_next/gnhncup?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (Thanks /u/Kepabar) which I found quite agreeable, and quite enjoyable.   


I am watching on Netflix, so I went down the list. If an episode was on either of those two lists, I would read the description AND give the episode a shot. 5-10 mins, depending on interest. If the episode was not on either of those lists, I read the description and made a decision based on that. This worked very well. The lists were spot on, and absolutely perfect. Now that I am a few episodes into season 3, I can safely say that I now understand, and agree -- early trek is hard! There were one or two episodes not recommended that I found enjoyable, and one or two recommended that I skipped.

Heres what I ended up skipping: S01E02, 03, 06, 10, 11, 15, 19 (half way, lol) S02E02, 18, 19, 21, 22( I was so confused when I did not see a season finale on watch lists. This was fun to find out about. Couldn't bring myself to watch it). Season 2 was much better than Season 1, and Season 3 is great so far.

Whats next? Well, I'll probably finish TNG soon enough, I'm on season 3 now, and so I'll need a similar list for DS9 - my next stop!

^(\*checks notes\*) OK. I fear I am just rambling. I wanted to say thank you, let everyone know what my method was, and what I ended up skipping. Guys and Gals, I can't say thank you enough. You are all amazing. 

TL;DR: Finished Voyager, needed help getting into other series. Posters overwhelmed me with amazing facts and help, which allowed me to weed out the bad episodes and fall in love with TNG.

I was wondering how the economy of Star Trek works. It always looks like there is no money, everyone can eat for free from replicators but everyone still works.

And so you end up with the small cabin and then you do what to make your life better? Only going up the ranks for a bigger cabin? Status seems to be some kind of currency as well and Picard always can somehow bring out some latinum in case a trade is needed. But in total it looks like socialism there.

Also there are colonists there. They work hard for a measly life. What are they working for? Fruits that one could just replicate with some cheap energy? And why doing it at all?

If it's socialism I wonder how the economy can stay in motion since we know from countless experiments that socialism doesn't work because of the missing price discovery and the uneven spread of power.

Crimdal,1613957751,lpbyf3,32,1,"As far as I know, Guinan is the only character that has been publicly invited back to the star trek universe for the upcoming season, during Patrick Stewart's appearance on the view where he asked in front of the audience if she would come back.

So who else might they bring back that would tie into precious canon and mix with Guinans character?

The one that I am hoping for is Q, the one I think seems obvious and easier to pull off with success is Worf.

Michael Dorn has been in more star trek episodes and movies than any one else, even Leanord Nimoy I believe. The Klingons have been pretty much dormant in discovery since the first season, and I think nonexistent so far in Picard unless they are somewhere in the background that I didnt notice.
Romulans and Klingons were mortal enemies forever, but towards the end of DS9 Worf started changing his mind about the romulans, remarking in the end of the war of the dominion about the romulans having honor despite his entire character arc up until then saying the opposite.

Michael Dorn is awesome and I wouldn't mind that being season 2 canon, and Guinan and Worf obviously had a subtle connection on TNG where multiple scenes involved them spending time together in ten forward. In a way, Guinan is a big part of the reason why Worf did the right thing and chose to try and become a good father. Plus, prune juice.

What I really want to see is Q.

Yes there are moments between 'micro brain with a macro head' and Q, but Micharl Dorn stated he would only come back for an important role, so bringing back all 3 seems improbable unless Worf is the major part that would seemingly be a seed for a Worf spin off afterwards.


We don't know a lot about 'Q the misanthrope', but what we do know is that there is a strong connection with Q and Picard, and Q and synthetics. Most people are aware of the connection between Q and Picards character, Q was there when his heart exploded and pretended to be his God, etc.

The more interesting parts to me are between Q and data, and  by extension synthetics. As well as between Q and Guinan.

Q and Guinan. Both have preexisting knowledge of each other before their time on enterprise, and both claim the other is dangerous. Guinan at one point even pretends to be doing some sort of defensive stance when she sees Q in ten forward, like she knows some way to defend against Qs powers. The whole episodes adds so many questions (Borg introduction episode) without a lot of answers that this part is easy to miss but the writers never got around to addressing that plot hole. Guinan is also the only thing to do physical damage to Q and not face repercussions for it. She stabbed Q with a fork while he had no powers, but getting vengeance on her after getting his abilities back didnt even seem to be a part of his thinking, granted the Calamar did more damage to him.

Q and Data. While Q was mortal and aboard the starship, the only person who advocated for Q was Data. When Q was caught in the tachyon (I think that's what it was) beam from the Calamar ship, and being pulled towards the calamar ship, it was data who saved Qs life while risking his own. Q even gave data a genuine gift on parting, allowing him to experience laughter without changing Data beyond a level which he would have been comfortable with.

So in a way Q now has an interest in synthetics as well. Picard is now a synthetic, and so is Soji, feels like a good time to update humanities trial by the Q.",startrek,"Season 2 of Picard: what legacy characters do you think they will bring back, and why?",3480,646,5.386996904024768
Adamsoski,1613956813,lpbnyr,94,1,"I am going through my first full rewatch of TNG, having first watched it a few years ago. It was the first Star Trek series I'd ever watched, but since then I've watched through everything Star Trek there is. This episode is deeply moving having a deeper history of Sarek - from TOS, but also from DIS (which, regardless of wider opinions on the show, I think most people can agree did an excellent job with Sarek's character). On top of that, I've also seen great in-depth exploration of Vulcans in VOY and ENT, which makes [this scene](https://youtu.be/URZLKECFjaY) (please ignore Brent Spiner's imitation violin playing) where Sarek sheds a single tear at a string concerto even more powerful, it emphasises how genuinely tragic it is to see a Vulcan let emotions get the better of them. 

I feel like in many ways this episode is the conclusion of the Vulcan 'storyline' in Star Trek - even though many Vulcan episodes were written afterwards, and set afterwards, this episode, by showing how a Vulcan can lose control at the end of his life, allows us to put a capstone on all.the rest of the understanding of Vulcan's we've picked up. (And yes, I do know Sarek make another appearance in Unification, which I watched recently in preparation for the DIS episode, but I don't think it's quite as moving or conclusive as this one).

This episode also gives us [arguably the best piece of acting in any bit of Star Trek media](https://youtu.be/MGd1z2OhHXA).

Voyager did this a few times as well I believe. But, until this episode all other 2 parters in Star Trek TV were planned and shot as a two-part episode. Not WoW; it was shot as a 1hr33 min (according to IMdB) feature length tv movie. But I always wonder...

If WoW was given today's budget (I'll make it easy not to use 1990's dollars), plus add a little to the film  I maintain that it would be one of the best Star Trek movies ever made. So I'll ask the community for fun to do just that!

My only guidelines, is not to go crazy on the budget (not Avengers: Endgame money, something reasonable like $50-$100 mil), increase the running time by about 20-40 min so it's closer to 2hrs like most modern theatrical films, and maybe add a character or two. The Way of the Warrior movie would have modern special effects, 4K HDR and sound, and the budget of films in the 21st Century. But, the film would largely stay the same as the episode we know. I will come back later with my idea, but I wanted to put this out in the universe to get the party started.",startrek,Star Trek DS9: Way of the Warrior - The Movie,1194,229,5.213973799126638

dahat1992,1613952794,lpaf4a,9,1,"Spoilers ahead for Star Trek Voyager, just in case that's necessary for a 20 year old show. 

I've been going through Voyager again, and in S3 E4, The Doctor starts losing his memory and intellect because of all the additions he's been making to his program. In the end, they cannibalize the diagnostic program for the EMH, which, according to the diagnostic program, has the same matrix as The Doctor. It suddenly hit me that, if the doctor is a life form, a person with rights of his own, isn't the EMH diagnostic program an intelligent life as well?

The diagnostic program consents to giving up his existence so that The Doctor can live. Currently, I have a couple pretty messy questions. First, is that program aware enough to be able to consent to the procedure? Remember how the doctor viewed himself at the very beginning. Like any other hologram. And second, even if we assume that he was fully aware of the gravity of what he gave up, why didn't the show have at least a moment of pause, like it had with Tuvix?

ardouronerous,1613831263,lo86vb,59,1,"I watched TMP in 2001 when I was 16 years old, and I loved it, it was my first exposure to TOS since I've never watched TOS, my first exposure to Trek in the early 90s was TNG, DS9 and VOY, although my first exposure to Kirk was Generations.

TMP was a visually stunning film in my opinion, I love the design of the V'ger exterior as the Enterprise enters the cloud. I love the Enterprise refit design, that's probably because I wasn't exposed to the TOS Enterprise, and what made me love the design was the Enterprise flyby, I love the score of the movie, especially the music for the Enterprise flyby and the V'ger entry, its a breathe taking score in my opinion.

I love the interaction between Spock, McCoy and Kirk, and this was my first true introduction to Spock and McCoy, yes I have seen them in TNG, but I didn't truly know who they are really when I was 10 years old.

I love the story of V'ger, for me it's very compelling, a machine trying to find its Creator, I find it compelling because it speaks to our human need to find meaning I'm our own lives, that is why we turn to religion, since our questions, who created us and is this all that I am, these questions cannot be asked by science, but by religion, so in a way, this makes V'ger's struggle relatable somewhat.",startrek,I think TMP is an underrated movie,1283,243,5.279835390946502
Khan_Cena,1613825365,lo6hpz,6,1,"Hello again all. Due to the overwhelming positivity I had regarding [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/lmgv41/i_just_watched_my_first_ever_episode_of_star_trek/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I figured you would all like an update on my journey so far into TNG. I‚Äôll warn you now, though, it‚Äôs a bit of a long post. So far I‚Äôve watched the first 10 episodes of season 1 and would like to share a couple thoughts I‚Äôve had while watching it thus far. (As a side note before I begin- I would like to say thank you to everyone who recommended that I should use a watch list instead of every episode, but I have to politely decline. I am just one who thinks that watching the bad episodes along with the good ones only enhances how good the good episodes are.... if that makes any sense at all lol)

The Naked Now- I‚Äôm sure if I watched TOS first this episode would‚Äôve been more enjoyable to me. I‚Äôm unsure how exactly Data got infected, is he part organic? For some reason I thought he was the first truly sentient synthetic life form. Not much else to add to this episode. 

Code of Honor- This episode was.... interesting to say the least. Getting some backstory into Tasha‚Äôs past was interesting, however. Was not expecting rape gangs in Star Trek, I was under the impression that the Federation (and humans in general) had grown past such things?

The Last Outpost- After I watched this episode I had to look up when it was released (1987), only to be surprised (more like impressed, actually) that an episode riffing on capitalism released only a few months after Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúTear down this wall‚Äù speech. Other than making me realize that this show isn‚Äôt afraid of making social commentary, I was introduced to the Ferengi... so that‚Äôs neat I guess. 

Where No One Has Gone Before- so there‚Äôs apparently beings other than the Q who can, to quote another show, do wibbly wobbly ~~timey-wimey~~ space-time alternating things? Also has a nice ‚Äúthe children are our future‚Äù message in there too which is always a nice reminder (funny on how that kind of message gets a new meaning every year, right?)

Lonely Among Us- Obligatory ‚ÄúWorf lookin‚Äô pretty sus‚Äù line here. In all honesty though this is my favorite episode thus far- all for one simple reason. Sherlock Data (specifically with the pipe) is amazing, and I love Ryker all the more for going ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø whenever anyone was like ‚Äúwhat the...‚Äù. Already looking like my favorite season 1 episode by far. 

Justice- I‚Äôve heard of ‚Äòprime directive‚Äô episodes, and now I‚Äôve experienced one. Interesting morals about interfering with the progress of a society, and I love how Picard just immediately shoots down the classic train scenario. I haven‚Äôt yet mentioned it yet but I think he‚Äôs a great captain with a great crew. 

The Battle- The mice people are back and they‚Äôre ready for revenge! Or at least they kinda are. I like the backstory about Picard and the world building surrounding headaches/medical advancements, but what I enjoyed most about this episode was the showing that not all ‚Äúhats‚Äù are the same. What I mean is that although the Ferengi are a society of hats, it‚Äôs not a one size fits all (something I felt wasn‚Äôt done in the series so far). The turn at the end by the Ferengi number 1 had me like ‚Äúah, so they aren‚Äôt all bad. Good to know!‚Äù  

Hide and Q- Q‚Äôs back and he‚Äôs after Ryker. I like the take on human nature this show is going for- one that likes to strive for achievement and improvement on its own. I also think this is very much a Ryker episode as it, and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, shows that he‚Äôs not just a Kirk 2.0 (from Star Trek 2009 and Into Darkness, I feel as though Kirk would‚Äôve taken those powers... and maybe would‚Äôve used them to slap Q around a bit.)

Haven- this was the first episode I wasn‚Äôt excited about. I just felt like it kinda went on for hours... I‚Äôm not sure why. I‚Äôm glad that didn‚Äôt get rid of Troy, although deep down I knew she wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the show so soon. 

And there‚Äôs my general thoughts on TNG so far. Again, I was blown away by the support you all showed on my last post and I‚Äôm excited to get to the later seasons. Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.",startrek,Thanks for being so welcoming!,4229,743,5.69179004037685

majordisinterest,1613815878,lo474h,11,1,"I've been thinking about this in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and the measures our society has taken to avert the risk from it. Some of the arguments made in Star Trek episodes persuade me that we may have become too risk averse. Like when Picard first encounters the borg, Q tells him ""if you can't take a little bloody nose maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondorous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross, but it's not for the timid."" And that absolutely applies to life in general as well. Maybe we should crawl back under our bed if we don't want the risk, but we'd be losing out.

Or TNG: A Matter of Time - at the end of that episode Picard is left with a choice: ""To try or not to try. To take a risk or to play it safe... I choose to try"". That's part of being human and I'd hate to see people lose that by becoming so risk averse. Like Archer said throughout ENT, they didn't send probes out into deep space to meet new species. They sent humans, or what's the point?

Then we have TNG:Tapestry when Picard is given the choice of a pathetic lonely existence or his own his death. And as we all know, he choose to die rather than to live the life he saw. It's the same choice we're given with the pandemic and it's sad to see so many people being so risk averse.

In DS9, when the changelings inflitrated Earth, Sisko's father refuses to take a blood test and I think he was right. ""You can't go around making people prove they are who they say they are. That's no way to live and I'm not gonna go along with it."" Equally I don't think you can go around asking people to prove their vaccination status or expect them to take a test.

In TOS: Return to Tomorrow, Kirk puts it best: ""Risk is our Business. That's what this starship is all. That's why we're aboard her.""

If you hate what I've said please tell me why, this is just to start discussion on the topic.

Tryingtobebetter07,1613784809,lnvyrh,15,1,"Grew up on all the TOS and TNG films. TNG was on TV while I was growing up and would watch an episode here and there. 

Last year I watched through all of TNG and loved it, I knew I would because I loved all the movies growing up. 

Anyway, I'm working on DS9 now. My initial thoughts. 

First of all, I think this show starts off a lot stronger than TNG. I'm up to episode 19 and very few episodes have been bad, compared to how rough the first couple seasons of TNG was. 

Commander Sisko - the first episode, I felt like the actor was trying too hard ? I'm sure he was under a lot of pressure being the next Captain after Picard. 

I'm sure Avery Brooks is a qualified actor but I'm waiting for something to happen with Sisko. So far I like that he's a good father and we are shown a lot of Sisko and Jake. There's also his previous relationship with Dax I guess and he's the ""Chosen One"" which I can never stand in any show but whatever. His relationship with Kira has it's interesting moments. I'm still waiting for him to grab me I guess. 

Kira - good actress, some interesting moments of where her loyalties lie.

Dax - Jesus Christ is she beautiful, it's distracting how attractive she is. Her previous lives and past friendship with Sisko is interesting I guess but I don't feel like they use her much. They keep talking about how great she is and how important she is but I feel like they aren't showing why. 

Odo and Quark - love both their characters and their relationship. I dunno if either of them will have anything more to do outside of what they currently are. 

Dr. Bashir - meh he is what he is. 

Jake - way more likable than Wesley lol I don't know what they'll do with him though. 

O'Brien - I like O'Brien and I feel like they could do more with him. Why is he such a low rank? Lol he's the chief engineer of the space station and he has 1 empty rank? 

Nog - I watched a bunch of Nog clips on youtube and it's kind of what got me started watching every episode, his arc is great and I think the actor did a great job. I wish we could of gotten Captain Nog somehow. 

I like that the show is on a space station with people coming and going. One thing that I've noticed is everyone is pretty low rank which I find interesting. There's this space station right beside this important worm hole and it's crewed by a low ranking ramshackle crew. 

Over the years of having DS9 on my to do list I've wikid it so I kind of know about Worf showing up eventually/The Dominion War and the ending kind of. 

I've heard that the Villain Gul Dukat is great and I'm waiting for him to show up. I wasn't impressed by the Cardassians in TNG so I'm excited that they are a big part of DS9 and can't wait to see how it all turns out.",startrek,First time DS9,2742,533,5.144465290806754

TheManofHexen,1613782255,lnv506,130,1,"I've noticed in several sci-fi franchises that there's usually very little attention to the *time* something happens, and I see it generally cause issues when exploring the lore of the franchise in question, but Star Trek doesn't have that problem due to stardates. Even though stardates might be confusing or sometimes meaningless, they are crucial to understanding how events took place in the franchise. 

Let's say you wanted to know when DS9's ""In The Pale Moonlight"" took place. Chances are, there's probably a stardate to tell you, or a year you can place the events of that episode in. But let's say you wanted to know how long Luke Skywalker trained on Dagobah in Empire Strikes Back. There isn't really any way to pinpoint that solely within the movies, as there isn't really any dialogue or anything to indicate how long that scene was in-universe. Could have been a few days, a week, there's not any way to tell. There might be some expanded universe explanation for it, but generally comes after-the-fact and by a different author/creator.

Stardates existing in Star Trek, across the various series, are an amazing concept and tool for dissecting the lore and timeline of events that happen within it's universe. They allow fans to figure out *when* something happened, and in what order it happened in. With stardates, you can explain what was happening in DS9 during an episode of TNG, or pinpoint when a character from DS9 showed up on TNG or Voyager. They might not be in every episode, but they're everywhere and there's enough to fill in the gaps between events. 

So, I'm glad that the writers kept using stardates and gave fans enough of them to piece together the timeline of Star Trek, I suppose.",startrek,Star Trek's concept of stardates is actually amazing compared to other sci-fi series,1720,294,5.850340136054422

Scotty gave the past aluminum glass. (1) Though we have made it today, so umm a 15 or so advance on tech ant that bad. But Voyager saw the computer boom of the 60s onward explode in a way that we have not seen up till janway blew the source of that advancement sky high.

Then we got Enterprise, I forget the guy's name, think he was the science officer? Seems like he had a thing for stealing future tech from that one guy. (2) T.O.S Flew into the unwon with outdated tech and ship to the one we see in discovery.  
The tech you see in both discovery and in Enterprise is tech that should not have existed in their timeline. Fro kirk the transporter was new, yet for Archer, it was also new. Shields were not an advent of Archer's time, yet his ship was shield near the end.

One of the few joys I get from the whore that is std. It's cheap and all it wants to do is fulfill our base instinct as apes, with action and violence. Yet I do like watching how the tech advanced from such abuses of the time.

Telek_RMor,1613748188,lnieqv,98,1,"I have been thinking a lot lately about how there is so much discourse and frankly, a lot of unreasonable hate towards people who are fans of Disco. I for one cannot stand the show, I can fully admit that I haven't given it a fair chance. Having said that, I found the first two episodes to be unwatchable but powered through them anyway. I couldn't stop finding things to hate/nitpick about it. I wanted it to be good. I got excited hearing about it being put into production. But I dislike the design of the ship, I don't think any of the bridge crew would make it through Starfleet Academy based on their behavior. There are other things I did not care for but I don't want this post to be a list of things to hate on. That is not helpful. Before anyone says ""Oh you just have to get through \*Number\* of episodes, I would like to say that I shouldn't have to watch a show until I get Stockholm syndrome in order to find it enjoyable. I am not expecting every episode to be great tv or amazing Star Trek, Code of Honor happened after all. I shouldn't be held hostage by a show until I think its good. Now I did also watch the episode 5 of season 1, where they notoriously drop a couple F bombs. While that's fine with me I do feel that kind of robs something from Star Trek, after all people are supposed to just be better right? I found the whole scene where they drop the F bomb to be really weird. It felt like the writers had a misunderstanding of this type of scene that has been done in trek for years. People standing around a console talking out their plan as a plot device to keep the viewer informed. But who were they talking to? They all clearly understood the plan already, normally at least one person in the scene is having the plan explained to them so its not quite so weird. It makes sense, the characters are talking to each other. In this scene they just talk at the air and state the plan, for no ones benefit. Now even if the characters are supposed to be flushing out a plan with each other I did not feel that it read that way. Normally I won't fault an actor for a bad script, but this scene I think it was a team effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having said all of this, it took me years to come around on Enterprise. I enjoy it now, but I was very critical of it when it came out but now it is a good series I enjoy. The writing was ok, the characters were underdeveloped and underused, some of the episodes were not that great but overall I think it has a lot going for it. I wonder if one day in several years from now when Disco is over I might end up enjoying it. But honestly after hearing about how there is a school of though that Disco lacks re-watchability I also wonder if maybe I will just forget it exists, like Star Trek Beyond. Which until a couple days ago I forgot about completely.

jurassiccomputer,1613742809,lngcup,31,1,"Season 3 of Discovery was highly anticipated because it opened a whole new timeline for the franchise, farther in the future than ever. But also because of the possibility of Saru, who is really a popular character in the show, perhaps even more than its protagonist Michael Burnham, being promoted to captain (which he was) and further developed as a character, and that‚Äôs what was somewhat disappointing.

He was portrayed as a weak captain, undecided and shy (inconsistently with his changes in season 2), a poor judge of character and intentions (inconsistently with his whole arc), lacking objectivity in his perspective (even though he demonstrated an impressive capacity fot self control that even improved that during his previous arc) and almost a token to highlight Burnham‚Äôs talents by opposition.

It almost seems like the writers, seeing how much Saru is loved by the fandom, gave what they want and then proceeded to ‚Äúsubvert our expectations‚Äù (a quote that will always taint Rian Johnson‚Äôs legacy, but I digress) in order to sell Michael as the true captain for Discovery, since she is the protagonist of the show.

The problem is, Michael already has amazing feats but even her purposed flaws work for her in the end with no accountability, no character growth, bordering on blockbuster action hero, which is great for a couple hours of entertainment but IMO doesn‚Äôt work so good in a TV series format, or at least in Trek (imho).

While weakening Saru so he also becomes an action blockbuster trope - the by-the-book character to be always outshined and schooled by the ingenuity and wit of our great heros - may disappoint a bit the fans who were eager to see captain Saru in all his glory.

Moreover, it seems that the character was sidelined for the next season. I simply don‚Äôt see another character as charismatic. They show will surely need one.",startrek,"Why does it seem that one of the fan favorite characters of DISCO (if not the absolute favorite), Saru, is not loved as much by the show-runners?",1867,316,5.908227848101266
dablor,1613738593,lnezc2,0,1,"I reviewed the second episode of TNG - The Naked Now on [Rough in the Diamonds](https://spoti.fi/342ePtZ) podcast.

Want to know a little about it? Ok, I'll tell you!

It was an amazing episode: amazing not in the sense that it was good, but the combination of elements that made it up were extraordinary. There was a flying couch, a soundboard phone prank, a sweaty man hanging out with a child, all kinds of sexy times, and an android doing a Google search for a good part the episode. See what I mean? Amazing.

Yet it (should have) had a strong plot: mystery disease makes it aboard &gt; infection spreads &gt; doctors cure sickness &gt; doctors are wrong &gt; everyone will die &gt; doctors find a true cure at the last moment. Add an existential threat of an exploding star or whatever, and we should have a really really good episode on our hands.

But we don't.

And it's not.

It was the second episode in the entire series, a show trying to win new viewers while winning over viewers of the original series. To do an episode so irrational and bizarre was... well... irrational and bizarre. 

If they'd dumped the outrageous silliness (they could have kept plenty of fun), kept these new characters in character while we learned what they were like, and maybe even moved the episode somewhere deeper in the series, it would have been much better, and much more appreciated.

I kind of loved it though.

I was born in 2001 (so I'm currently 19) and I never watched Star Trek when I was a kid because I always assumed it was a ""nerdy"" rip-off of Star Wars or something, which is a very cringe statement in retrospect. I sort of ""discovered"" the franchise in 2016 (when I was 15) by accident during a Google search for a school assignment. The movie that I stumbled upon was JJ Abrams' Star Trek (2009).

I was bored so I decided to watch it and I loved it! I then watched Into Darkness. And then Beyond in cinemas! I'm lucky I discovered this trilogy soon enough to be able to watch its last entry in cinemas. I feel sad that I wasn't able to watch the previous two movies in cinemas. Anyways, after all of that, this trilogy became my ""special interest."" This means that I would spend a lot of time thinking about it and making cringy art and fanfics, binging any video and podcast remotely related to them, and constantly talking about it with my friends at school.

When I started listening to podcasts about these specific movies, I accidentally absorbed and learned a lot of information about the rest of the franchise as well, leading me to get out of my comfort zone and watch more Trek outside of the Kelvin timeline. I watched Wrath of Khan to compare it to Into Darkness. Needless to say that it was a lot better and now it's my second favorite of the movies. Beyond is still my number one favorite. But I might be a little biased because it is the only Trek movie I watched in cinemas. I didn't watch The Motion Picture first because I kept hearing it was boring. I eventually watched it and while it wasn't my favorite, I still liked it just fine. Then I watched the rest of the movies prior to 2009, followed by the Star Trek Discovery and Lower Decks TV shows.

I've recently started to check out each one of the older TV shows before Discovery and Lower Decks. I've watched around 10 episodes of each of the shows just to try, and I honestly don't see myself finishing these shows, not because I don't like them, but because I usually never finish TV shows. Especially those that are TOO long for me. I think that my ADHD might have something to do with that, but we'll see...

Star Trek is now one of my favorite series right now. I love the characters, the starships, the stories, and the different iterations of it. And while it is true that I have outgrown JJ Abrams' Star Trek trilogy when I started to watch more objectively better iterations, I still hold this movie trilogy with a lot of fondness in my heart because I wouldn't be the Star Trek fan that I'm now without 'em.

I know that these movies are HEAVILY despised by a lot of Trekkies, and I now understand why. However, I firmly believe that these movies are a great entry point for people who are new to the franchise. They are accessible, fun to watch, and introduce you to the basic elements of Star Trek.

Welp. There it is. I hope that in the future I can get more involved in this community. Love y'all! ‚ù§Ô∏è",startrek,How I became a Star Trek fan!,3207,602,5.327242524916944

Some are obviously Sentient, like Data; that was proven in Measure of a Man. I will use the criteria from that episode to judge everything else (Are they intelligent, self-aware and conscious). Androids like Soji are obviously sentient as well.

What about holograms like the EMH and Vic Fontaine? What about the evil hologram Seska who steals the doctor's mobile emitter and tries to take over Voyager? All three of them are intelligent, drawing from large computers, self-aware, as they all acknowledge they are holograms and try to better themselves, and I would argue conscious as well, at least in the cases of Fontaine and the Doc (they both understand what it is like to be turned off and on again. The EMH dreads being turned off and Fontaine asked Bashir to let him sing a little longer when he left, as he enjoyed it. Let me re-iterate: a Holosuite character wants to sing a little longer after everyone left the Holosuite because he likes it. He has emotions and hobbies.

CleanReserve4,1613664295,lmq31h,42,1,"Full disclosure, a certain label as it is placed on Wesley Crusher annoys me quite a lot. For one, the fandom really ganged up on Wil Wheaton and it had serious impact on him. But it's also not fair from the show standpoint. In fact, I think Picard tends to take him for granted.

In ""The Game"", Wes meets makes friends with a new Ensign, and they basically save the ship, and possibly Starfleet from an infiltration of potentially large scope, by applying critical thinking skills. But at the end, we don't even see him get a thanks. I think he deserved a commendation.

I think this is showing some taking for granted, but maybe a little resentment from Picard? The Captain should have caught this, or Deanna should have been paying attention. But they failed. Hell, the Captain almost lost his ship. Such a close call almost deserves an inquiry.

This gets back to the label. Wes was no such thing here at all here, he just asked some simple questions and used his skeptical mind to solve a problem.

In a bigger sense, young people aren't Mary Sues for being creative and smart. Nineteen year old Sean Fanning upended the music industry with his creativity. Twenty Six year old Albert Einstein upended our understanding of reality with three revolutionary physics papers in one year. And Lennon/McCartney revolutionized pop/rock with four incredible albums before they were twenty seven.

The lead characters are fantastic and get great dialogue to work with, and the side characters to after a little while, the stories are sometimes actually thought-provoking and compelling, and the direction and special effects, for the time, can be quite dazzling.

But let's be real, after the first season, I dunno, maybe they start to run out of fresh ideas. A lot of the episodes are the same blueprint of the crew landing on an alien planet where it's just humans from a different time period like old Chicago or the Wild West. Some of the allegory and social commentary is so obvious and hamfisted that while it might have been profound once, it's pedantic now. And while some of the episodes are thrilling and exciting even by today's standards, a lot of them are just agonizingly dull.

Scott's comments in ""[Relics](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Relics_(episode))"" would seem to support this.

From Wikipedia:

\- ""There is no [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(Star_Trek)) information about the ship's fate beyond *Star Trek VI*. In the epilogue of [*Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_VI:_The_Undiscovered_Country), Uhura had stated they received a communication from [Starfleet Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet#Starfleet_Command) that ordered *Enterprise* to report to space dock to be decommissioned. However, she may have been speaking only of the ship's original crew members as [Captain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(Star_Trek)) [James T. Kirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk) previously stated his crew was due to stand down in three months, while [Spock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock) noted this would be his last voyage on *Enterprise* as a member of her crew; and Captain Kirk states in his closing log entry the ship ""will become the care of another crew,"" but no further information is given. 

There is the theory that the A was put into the emergency response fleet at Wolf 359, but the evidence for that is pretty fuzzy.

It might be a stretch, but, with all the possibilities open with Trek these days, man, it sure would be fun to see the old bucket of bolts make a real appearance once more.

I don‚Äôt know much about Star Trek, but I finally thought I‚Äôd give it a shot (with a name like ‚ÄòKhan‚Äô I was turned off to the franchise due to people yelling ‚ÄúKhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan‚Äù at me all to often growing up).

After much thought I decided I would start off with The Next Generation, for a few main reasons. First of all was the fact that TNG seems to have a lot of gravity in the community, and secondly I think Patrick Stewert is a great actor.... and I have to admit I actually really enjoyed it. 

I don‚Äôt know too much about the series, but I knew a lot of the basics/memes going into it. A couple thoughts I have had:

I hope Wesley doesn‚Äôt become a marry sue, but my hopes aren‚Äôt all to high since he seemed to know everything about the captain‚Äôs chair before he ever sat in it. 

Q kinda seems like a dick tbh. Like I know he‚Äôs a reacquiring character and everything, but all he seems to want to do is be a jerk to the Enterprise specifically.

Ryker feels like some sort of Kirk 2.0, all while being someone totally new and different than the Kirk I knew from the movies. He gives off a ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm pretty dope and I know it‚Äù vibe at the same time he gives off a ‚ÄúYeah I have more to learn from this older captain‚Äù vibe as well.

I thought Worf and Geordi played larger roles in the ship going into it, but they both seem like interesting characters nonetheless.

I‚Äôm kinda curious about Picard and Dr. Crusher‚Äôs history together, seems like it could be an interesting plot point.

klarhedskontrol,1613627716,lmf87o,1,1,"It was early 1992. My dad had been given a posting to Germany (he being a part of the British army in Germany), and he'd been given enough leave time to take me, my brothers and my sister home to the UK to meet up with family for Christmas. I've never been someone that did particularly well in crowds; in school I was desperately unpopular, unhappy, and much of that frustration boiled over to home life. However, through all the hustle and bustle, my uncle steve had popped down to say hi and noticed me in the corner very much trying to keep out of the way of everyone else. He gave me a nudge, ruffled my hair and said ""come on, I have something to show you"" - at that point, I excitedly made my way upstairs to my uncle Steve's room.

Now I should explain, that my Uncle's room was nirvana to me; full of transformers, star wars, a multitude of books that he excitedly pushed the latest acquisitions into my hand...and star trek. So much star trek. I of course knew a little about star trek from the original series; occasionally my dad would let me stay up to watch an episode of the original series on SSVC, or the films (a forces broadcaster of the day) but....Getting content from the US was slow to say the least; in those days it often relied heavily on knowing someone that knew someone who had cable in the US and willing to mail tapes over, or satellite. All I knew was that my uncle was *very* excited about the tape that he had in his hands, pushed it into his VCR and pressed play and then just sat back. I think most of the time he spent just watching me for a reaction; I watched, intently at the life on the screen; images washing over me of Jean Luc picard conversing with Sarek; deep in the throes of Bendii syndrome, and desperately spewing out all of his feelings and regrets for his son.

To this day, the episodes remain my very favourite episodes, but recently they've really shone out as something special - you see my uncle is 63, and has early onset dementia which is...rare because he started developing it fairly young. I have him living with me so that he can enjoy the independence he still has for as long as he can, but the other day I found the VHS of the episodes i'd watched with him all of those years ago; spent a few days fixing my old vcr and loaded it up for a sake of nostalgia - you see, our house is filled with much of his old star trek memorabilia, but he really doesn't recall any of it and instead focuses on stargate and NCIS, but while watching these episodes he just...Sat down and watched them with me, just like he would 30 years ago to keep me company. I don't know why I'm sharing all of this with you especially; i guess I just wanted someone out there to know how overjoyed I was to have my uncle back for a moment, and how special it feels to me that these two particular episodes where  as a grown man I could now draw so many parallels brought him back to me for just a few moments. it's been a rough year, for him especially...It was nice to have a calm in the storm, and a true moment of grace.

The basic answer is that consoles explode because it makes it look like exciting and dangerous things are happening on the ship. But that explanation is boring, so lets look at why a console would shower people with sparks and blow up.

Strange as it may seem, it is possible to make a console/object explode even with a working fuse. The reason why is because of the way a fuse works.

\*A picture of a fuse\*

This is a fuse, just like you would find in any piece of electrical equipment. The way a fuse works is that in a normal state of operation, and under the fuses rated amperage, nothing happens. But when there is a power surge, the amperage going through the fuse shoots up like crazy heating up that filament and causing it to break.

[Fuse (electrical)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical))

Now the time it takes for a fuse to reach that breaking point is determined by different factors, but the important thing to realize is that it may not happen instantly. Additionally, the break caused by the overheating may not be all that large, which is also important.

What happens when a ship is hit is that vast energies are sent like shockwaves through the electrical system. Those energies may be from the phaser directly hitting the ship, or (more likely in my opinion) from the vast energies the ship has to use to create the shielding used to protect the ship from the energy blast. The sudden cessation of which would cause a generator to over power. Where ever it comes from that energy has to go somewhere, and it will spread through the electrical systems blowing fuses along the way.

Now remember that a fuse is nothing more than a piece of metal designed to melt when a certain amperage limit is reached. This melting happens very quickly, but is not instant. Also due to the high energy levels, it is also possible for the electricity to jump the small gap that is created. And once past the fuse, it will invariably start to impact the next object on the circuit in a negative manner. This can cause the panels on the starship to explode.

This is also why it is recommended that you turn off electrical equipment like TV‚Äôs and PC‚Äôs during a lightning storm, it is possible for a lightning strike to get past all of the circuit breakers and fuses in your house and destroy such electrical equipment.",startrek,"Exploding consoles.

Also I'm not a fan of episodes where characters are trapped inside the holodeck with the exception of TNG's Ship in a Bottle which is also in my top ten). 

The funny thing is both my exceptions besides being among my favorites have something else in common. In Duet it's not one of the major characters on trial, and in Ship in a Bottle while it is major characters in the holodeck, they don't realize it until near the end, it a minor character that's actually trapped in the holodeck. So maybe it's okay to repeat a trope as long as it's not centered around a major character? Not sure but it happens to work out this way.

You mean to tell me that this is a ""skippable"" episode? I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I absolutely loved Data in this!

I have fond fond childhood memories of ONLY the first seasons, because TV4, the network who aired it, only aired a few eps of the first, possibly the 2nd as well.

In this season we see how and Q gave his powers to Riker in one episode

Sure, some dialog in the Q -&gt; Powers - Riker, like; ""Is this sex?"" Worf: ""Yes! But I have no place for it in my life now!"" meanwhile hitting or being hit by a female klingon, is a bit on the, eh, tamer side, perhaps... but does it spoil an entire FASCINATING episode? Heck no! :)

I was 10 when these episode aired, in Sweden. And they only showed one or two seasons of episodes, and then claimed they would be back after ""a short while"". That is TV lingo for ""half an eternity"", or in this case: NEVER :(

Luckily for me, after 3 years or so, another network picked up the series :)

BUT, for the LONGEST TIME, I only knew star trek the next generation for it's first season (possibly 2, my memory may be incorrect). And I just LOVED IT!

&amp;#x200B;

It's in these eps where we get to met the traveller, who takes the enterprise to ""the very end of the universe, or the very beginning of it"". I was just FASCINATED.

A lot of people seem to think that a TNG episode needs to have our minds blown each and every time, and while I agree that that is sure a great thing when it happens, I was just PSYCHED for the RIDE that these first few TNG episodes gave me.

What a ride, what a ride :) The quality of the pacing, editing, the cinematic feel to it. Just WHAT was going to happen NEXT on this EPIC scifi series? I had seen NOTHING like it, ever, and this was back in 1990 in Sweden. (Yes, we usually got series 3 years later than in the US).

Middle_sea_struggle,1613547117,llovx8,1,1,"I was watching the often reviled TOS episode ""The Alternative Factor"" the other day and I realized something very strange. The plot, and stylistically, for some reason, matches up with elements of Twin Peaks: The Return. To a degree that I think a case can be made that David Lynch may have drawn some inspiration from it.

 The first thing I noticed was when Spock is explaining the magnetic wink event to Kirk the exchange ends with Kirk saying, ""That means your saying..."", to which Spock replies, ""is **nonexistence**"". When Good Cooper is escaping from the red room, he is dropped into the mauve zone by the evolution of the arm's doppelg√§nger, who cries, ""**Nonexistent**"" right before it happens. The arm is also called the man from another place in original run, and initially the script alluded that they were aliens, though that was input by Mark Frost. That's weird but alright not much there. Then the plot develops centering around Lazarus and his anti-matter Doppelganger traveling through time and fighting between worlds. Very strong similarities there to Twin Peaks between Good Cooper and Mister C. 

 Also there are a number of stylistic comparisons, one in particular is very strong, when cooper is dropped into the mauve zone he falls through space blurring and shaking. In the star trek episode there are very similar frames when Lazarus-A and B are fighting, albeit with a blue tint, one in particular is almost identical with stars superimposed in a double exposure over Lazarus.

 Finally and honestly what convinced me was the ending. Anti-matter Lazarus traps doppelg√§nger Lazarus in the tunnel between their worlds, a sort of pocket universe. I've attached a link to an album with screencaps from both at the bottom.

 The ending of The Return is up for debate, but a very popular interpretation is this(major spoilers): 

&gt;!After Cooper travels back to 1989 to stop Laura's death, he returns to the present and travels with Diane to a pocket universe, they arrive in what seems like the past to perform a sex magic ritual and lure Judy into it, he wakes up and the Motel they stayed at now looks much newer and it seems he's traveled back in the present.  He then brings Laura/Carrie to her home in Twin Peaks, Washington after finding her in Twin Peaks, Texas(a real place). They drive in a single night all the way there and arrive ostensibly the same night, though it's not made clear it doesn't imply they ever stop. In reality to get from Twin Peaks, Texas to North Run, Washington where Twin Peaks was partly filmed is about 28 hours by car non stop. This has been interpreted to mean the geography of this reality is much contracted, tentatively supporting the pocket universe hypothesis. When they arrive at the house they speak with the owner, walk back into the street, seem confused, and Cooper asks, ""what year is it?"" before Laura looks back at the house, screams, and all the light go out in the house before the frame cuts to black. Some interpret this as the pocket universe collapsing through forcing Judy to come into contact with Laura. So he's traveling through time with the aid of the White Lodge and the giant/fireman, trying to trap her in a pocket universe. Though it's not at all cut and dry, and whether or not he succeeded if it was his attempt is also impossible to say.!&lt;

Bonus points, the next episode of Star Trek is The City at the Edge of Forever, where they are travel back to the 1930's and meet Edith Keeler, who gives a speech in the mission where she starts talking about man harnessing the atom for the sake of good. That's a major plot point of Twin Peaks where it is implied that the atom bomb released Bob and crew into our universe creating the evil Cooper has to battle.

This is all tenuous at best and David Lynch's work is dense and his inspirations are often difficult to discern, and to my knowledge he's never talked about this and I doubt he would, but I think it's neat to think he might have taken some inspiration from the style and story of this episode, and he was in college at the time the episode came out and very well may have seen it at an important stage in his creative development. It might be a long shot but there are a number of similarities. What do y'all think?

 [CGP Grey released a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nQHBAdShgYI) explaining the practical considerations and philosophical head-scratching involved in a ""Star Trek""-esque transporter. In short, it would involve the atoms that¬†make us up to be broken down and then reassembled in a different state. Of course, the atoms would be identical to you;¬†the way you look, the structure of your brain, even technically your thought patterns and memories. But then comes the metaphysical headache¬†of whether that *is* you or just a copy of you. If it does just copy¬†you, then the transporter is pretty much a fancy suicide booth. ¬†

 Well, the plot thickens.  [MinutePhysics has¬†released a rebuttal](https://youtu.be/dAaHHGHuy1c) that¬†thinks it might have the answer. In their video they explain that scientists began looking at a thing called quantum teleportation in the nineties. This is the process whereby quantum information ‚Äì¬†such as the state of an atom‚Äì- could be transmitted. However, a major clause in this theory is the ‚Äúno cloning theorem.‚Äù Essentially, to create a replica of a quantum state, the original must be destroyed in order to obtain all the information.

Science is still pretty shady on what exactly constitutes consciousness and what makes you¬†‚Äúyou,‚Äù so it's still hard to say. However, if it was something to do with the quantum state of certain electrons and atoms in our brain, then it doesn‚Äôt look too hopeful that ‚Äúyou‚Äù would survive the journey.

Go find an asteroid to mine and some place where you can find a lot of deuterium or antimatter.  Then find an isolated location and begin constructing your ship.  

Use holograms and robots for mining and construction.  So you could design and build a ship from scratch which would be difficult but possible if you have capable engineers working for you.

Run a thorough background check on them to make sure there aren't any trouble makers or mutineers.  But plan for scenarios where the crew mutinies just in case.

I am one of those people, and I wondered, after watching Lower Decks (and really enjoying it) what the difference is for me. Both portray humor in a Star Trek(-like) setting, often involving physical pranks and crudity.

I think I finally figured it out: it's essentially in the name, ""Lower Decks"". Having interacted with a lot of Army soldiers through my work life, I know the combination of youth and abject boredom that causes them to do crazy shit. That's the setting of Lower Decks, young officers who often work menial tasks and need an outlet for their boredom.

The Orville however plays entirely on the Bridge, these are all senior officers with lengthy careers behind them, and to behave like that is entirely incongruent with their characters. There **is** humor on real-life command bridges, but it is humor within strict bounds that don't get violated.

So yeah, I think that's what rubbed me the wrong way about Orville's humor: it isn't believable, it pulls me out of the show.

Our mission is to engage with our Edmonton community, share our interests with others and host our own events.

This a fact finding mission in hopes to recruit non-commissioned and commissioned crew.

The next step would be recruit other Star Trek fans who would be interested in Starfleet Marines or the MACO division of Starfleet.

This will be a slow and productive building process.   
 There are many steps to commission and launch a ship.   
 There is a time and effort commitment.   
 The time spent and friendships made will be worth it.

We know that in some small way that the Mirror Universe is linked in some small way to Transporters. This can be seen throughout the entire canon series in some way from TOS, DS9, and my belief ENT.  The first objection is that we don't see the mirror universe connected to Transporters and that we see it connected through the Mirror Universe Tholians in the Capture of the Defiant. We are not explicitly told that this is in the mirror universe in TOS... so for the sake of argument lets put that whole idea aside.   


But didn't the Mirror Universe begin way before what happened to Hoshi? I mean, we see events that were much different in history that definitely preceded Hoshi and her life... This is what made even more sense of the Episode Vanishing Point to me.  Strictly speaking... not only did she go to another place while stuck in the transporter (or in the other universe). She also went back in time. We see that there is some ability to do that if the conditions are right with Transporters in the DS9 Episode Past Tense. In this theory, she went back millions of years (to a time period where the civilization that had been dead for millions of years to shatter point that she created.  This also explains why in the  ENT episode Exile  that she had a very different idea psychic feel about her.   


What is the Mirror Universe then?   


It is a universe that Hoshi created because of her special abilities that took her back in time and created a universe that could hold all of the things that she was not.

Praxius,1613386170,lkb9wk,54,1,"Riker was Captain Material after his first year on the Enterprise D. In Season 2 he was preparing to command his own ship before he eventually backed off.

Through the years he was offered command multiple times and yet he preferred to stay as the first officer of the Flagship. As Picard noted, there's a certain prestige that comes with being a part of the Enterprise, but nothing compares to commanding your own ship.

If I recall, the last ship he was offered before finally taking command of the USS Titan, was the USS Melbourne. If he decided to take that command, he would be dead, because the Melbourne was destroyed at Wolf 359.

As great as Riker was at being Commander and a Captain, I highly doubt the USS Melbourne would have stood any better chance against the Borg and would have still been destroyed.

(apparently there were two USS Melbourne ships at Wolf 359, an Excelsior Class and a Nebula Class. The Nebula Class was to replace the older ship and was to be the one Riker took command. Both were sent and both were destroyed)

In addition, if Riker took command of the Melbourne, Shelby would have ended up as Acting Captain on the Enterprise when Picard was taken and turned into Locutus. She was smart and quick thinking, but she didn't have the experience (wasn't ""seasoned"") like Riker and she didn't know the crew and the ship like Riker did. She didn't know Picard/Locutus like Riker did. She also didn't know her or the crews limits and would keep pushing them to exhaustion.

I think the writers really didn‚Äôt know how to write Vulcans. With Spock it was easier because he was half human so they would inject personality, humour and a snarky sarcasm to him, but with Tuvok they just went for ‚Äústick in the mud‚Äù. 

All he does in multiple episodes is complain and antagonise Neelix (for someone so unemotional he sure had a lot of emotions against Neelix). 

The writers also seemed to not realise what unemotional means for Vulcans: Vulcans were never meant to be bland or like robots. They just completely bury their emotions to achieve heightened rationality and a peaceful state of mind. How is being constantly annoyed with Neelix (verging on xenophobia) rational? 

It‚Äôs a shame as well because Tim Russ is actually a good actor but the material he was given to work with is abysmal. Maybe it also had to do with the fact that most (if not all) Tuvok-centric episodes are some of the stoat episodes on voyager.

At the end of the day I think Tuvok suffered from the same fate as Chakotay: the writers just didn‚Äôt know how to make him interesting and write good episodes about him. It‚Äôs hard to write a compelling story about someone who has the personality of a block of wood.

Crimson dust blew past the oval window when a shuttle lifted off and flew away from the compound. Glowing blue nacelles on either side of the small craft flashed in the distance as it sped off into the cloudy blue sky. Visible faintly beyond the clouds, massive shipbuilding structures hovered in low-orbit of the red planet. From the lounge of Ground Base 312, Commander Benjamin Sisko gazed out the viewport as he sat in his command-red uniform and drank his steaming coffee. A pad sat on the table in front of him and displayed footage of a vintage 2015 baseball game‚Äîcolumns of player stats scrolling vertically beside the image. A pair of white doors slid open in the lounge. Lieutenant-Commander Shuri entered the room‚Äîher dual powder-blue Andorian antennae twisting left and right before they landed on Sisko.

Shuri smiled and locked her eyes on him.

Sisko chuckled as she strode to his table in her engineer-gold uniform.

‚ÄúMay I sit, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù Sisko motioned with his mocha-skinned hand at the empty seat across from him.

Shuri seated herself, then leaned over his pad. ‚ÄúCatching up on some more of that archaic game you love so much?‚Äù

Sisko sighed, turning it off. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm just trying to take my mind off some things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat things?‚Äù

Sisko shook his head, casually waving her away.

‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt do that, Benjamin. Tell me. Maybe I can help.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to trouble you with it, Shuri.‚Äù She had enough problems with her brother passing away recently of a rare disease; Sisko doubted Shuri had the room for *his* sob story in her life.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no trouble, Benjamin. We‚Äôre friends, remember?‚Äù

Shuri was right, of course. If there was one person in all of Utopia Planitia that Sisko could confide in, it was her. They‚Äôd gone through the academy together, and no one knew him better, besides maybe Old Man.

Sotto voce, Sisko said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been offered command over an abandoned Cardassian space station, out near Bajor.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeep Space Nine?‚Äù

Sisko leaned back, wide-eyed. ‚ÄúHow did you know that?‚Äù

Shuri blushed, though, on a blue Andorian, this was hardly noticeable. ‚ÄúBajor‚Äôs a secret hobby of mine. I‚Äôve been following the news about it since the Cardassian occupation began.‚Äù

There was an uncomfortable silence.

Shuri smiled, then slapped Sisko‚Äôs knee. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs great for you, Commander. We‚Äôll miss you here on Mars. But you‚Äôll forget about all‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not accepting the assignment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Shuri garnered strange looks from a few ensigns as they entered the lounge. She relaxed and modestly cleared her throat. Then, she leaned toward Sisko. ‚ÄúHow can you not take the assignment?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my son. Jake needs me. He‚Äôs only twelve years old, and Earth is the best place for him‚Äînot Mars, certainly not on Deep Space Nine.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you want a posting on Earth then?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but Admiral Leyton denied all my requests. Then, he offered me Deep Space Nine to make up for it‚Äîa job no one else wants and which he knows is the last place I would ever choose to go.‚Äù

Shuri raised her left antenna. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs exactly what he wants‚Äîfor you to retire.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. He knows it‚Äôs more than just me desiring to raise Jake on Earth. Ever since Jennifer died, I‚Äôve been considering retiring from Starfleet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúFear, perhaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Benjamin. You lost your wife; you have a son to raise. That‚Äôs not cowardice. I wouldn‚Äôt fault you for leaving the whole galaxy behind if you felt you needed to, and I‚Äôve never known you to be anything but brave.‚Äù

Sisko didn‚Äôt know how to react; he‚Äôd never heard her say something like that before.

She continued, ‚ÄúYou know what I think?‚Äù

Sisko grinned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying to find out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you love it too damn much.‚Äù

Sisko closed his eyes, nodding gently. *I‚Äôll miss you, Shuri.* He didn‚Äôt know how to tell her, but Shuri was a one-in-a-billion friend; he figured she already knew.

Bajor was far from Sol, but maybe Sisko would visit Mars, and Shuri would still be here. This new assignment would likely be over in a week, anyhow. He could stop by Mars on his way back to that little blue world called home and say hi. *This Deep Space Nine thing might not turn out that bad, after all.*

Sisko turned the pad back on, then rotated it on the table so that Shuri could see.

She giggled and hunched over it, joyously eyeing the screen as Buck Bokai hit a grand slam.

Number one thing I liked  about the series was spock. He's the cool calm*logical* partner perfect for Kirk. His little spats with Bones across the episodes This Side of Paradise really cracked his character open, and showed that he wasn't just a robot (it might have taken his ex to drug him to get to to that emotional capable state but oh well). 

Then, in the very next episode, in Devil In the Dark, he starts calling Jim by ""Jim"" instead of ""Captain."" And his emotions continue to get the better of him, even going so far to tell Jim to kill the creature. And Jim says that's the opposite of what he wanted initially. SO GOOD!

And the other main thing I liked is the diversity. Rodenberry was ahead of his time. He had characters of all races and cultures included. Heck, even Khan's crew was diverse. When he started calling out names, I noticed a Spanish, Chinese, and Irish name if I recall correctly.

ScarletApathy14,1613261610,ljcwo9,12,1,"Throughout season 3, Degra and Archer have kind of a special dynamic compared to the other Xindi (except maybe Gralik but he's different) in that they don't hate each other, but they don't like each other either. 

However, there's one episode i can recall where Degra, under an uneasy alliance with Archer who previously presented evidence counter to what the Xindi were told, was upset with Archer about having to blow up a Reptilian ship, then in the same breath he blows up the Reptilian ship after all, saying he doesn't want to risk the other Xindi finding out about his truce with Archer.

We know that Degra was expressing doubts about the weapon, confiding to an unnamed Arboreal that there were children on Earth and he's scared of destroying the planet out of concern for his own children.

Archer tells T'Pol, after returning to Enterprise unharmed from the Aquatic ship, that he got through to ""one of them,"" meaning Degra.

When asked by Tucker about Degra's loyalty, Archer says,

&gt; He may not be on our side, but I'm sure that he's starting to question his.

Finally, after calling a cease fire, Degra boards Enterprise to tell Archer his plan. The meeting comes to an end with Archer offering to shake Degra's hand, therefore making the truce permanent. Degra even sympathizes with Archer, promising that Enterprise will return to being a ship of exploration soon enough.

Story-heavy, crucial spoilers ahead 

And it's a minor quibble on my part really, but...

When, at the end Tieran attempts to survive by escaping and hiding in a new host body...yet again...  
As it was explained in a few scenes before, wasn't the Doctor's device's operation and effectivenes was based on the implants Tieran used in his host bodies for the transference...which begs the question... was that man going to be a new willing host, which makes him out to be quite a distasteful traitor to be such a willing plaything just to get closer to having power...meanwhile Tieran himself can be played up as a tragic hero gone too far, spiralling out, losing himself...  
and alternatively, if not, if he did not have the implant would that not dispute the functionality of Doctor's device entirely..? Or am I missing something..? 


So, in the end, was it really only all done up to play off Jennifer Lien's, admittedly, brilliant (at least at that time) and brilliantly showcased varied range of acting abilities...with the story progression being mostly driven not by it's own logic and said world's created set of rules, intrinsic to it, but rather by days ex machina and plot armor...

Also, unrelated but on my mind at the moment...that Enterprise episode,  Rajiin... first and foremost as a matter of course, quite a few quibbles I have with it... and again with that seduction and sexuality trope of femme fatales/pseudo damsels-in-distress... meanwhile they're playing up the captain's personal recovery and setting up his character development as a man of integrity in a tough spot, an impossible situation really, while still trying to be true to himself, to what it means, what it is to be human...
And all that other story details setup for the things they'll be developing furthermore later on in the season, in retrospect that was quite good work in that aspect...  
and annoyingly, in the end, what happened to her, to Rajiin..? She seemed a lot more than what the insurgent agent on Risa, tracking info on Suliban turned out to be, both in acting and as a character front(ier)/angle... sad we never really got to learn more about her, and her whole story... or more about the stuff happening with all those new and quirky little civilisations found in the expanse, sadly no real follow-up, but I suppose there was a certain continuity point to go with that decision for the story...  
but still frustrating to see yet another character build up only to be discarded or lost almost immediately...yes, very much in vein of the original series, a monster &amp;/or story of the week/episode, a serial setup quite common, but for those moments and elements that were so beloved, there was meant to be a potential for their own continuity to be fitted in with the ongoing overarching story...

ptlg225,1613174380,liocao,21,1,"I very liked Deep Space Nine, one of the best Star Trek show ever, but always feeled that the end was rushed. I liked that the show unfolds many species and galactic powers we just seen for the duration of an episode. The Cardassians, Bajor‚Äôs occupation, the Ferengi and so on, we get to know more and more about them.

One of my favorites were the Ferengi, the always latinum crawing con artists, the merchant who become clever to scam their customer and the businessmen who evermore wants to profit from everything. You understood what motivates and drives them, basically in the surface its greed and making more money. In the Ferengi civilization the most meaningful goal in life is earning profit, in their culture you worth as much as you have. We see their believes and concepts about this philosophy like the Great Material Continuum, buying your place in the afterlife, their strict law to always pursue profit with every business and the famous Rules of Acquisition.

The ferengi characters in the show are very interesting and captivating. Quark as he tries to run a profitable business and be a ferengi role model, but in the same time have a dilemma to listening to his consciousness and feeling remorse. Nog as he growing up and choose to left behind the ferengi pursue for profit lifestyle for meaningful happiness and live a worthwhile life but still valuing his culture. And Rom who is a little slow, lack self-confidence and dont have any talent earning latinum is basically a ferengi failure, but a brilliant engineer and can fix almost anything.

There was some very good episodes focusing on the ferengi culture and the characters is tangled shenanigans for money or pursuing others things. I liked the episodes with Brunt and Quark encounters with the FCA, the Grant Nagus Zek and that everyone tries to be his successor and many more things. Or those episodes like when Pel a female ferengi disguise herself as a male to earn profit or Quark mom Ishka illegally makes profit was very entertaining.

I exceptionally loved the episode Profit and Lace where the Grant Nagus Zek and his lover Ishka goes to DS9 because they needed to flee from Ferenginar. Zek just made a new law allowing females to wear clothes, but this decision brought with it several problems from the ferengi males point of view. If females can wear clothes they can go outside, if they can go outside they can work and if they can work they can earn profit. But in the episode they explain it with using logic and reason why its a good thing for the ferengi economy, not just stating that by the human standards its unethical. Presenting the situaton from the ferengi point of view, that if females can work they will earn profit and also will spend money too. Many employer gets a lot of new employee they can get to use to earn more profit and a lot of merchants can sell a lot of female product with high value. As Ishka is said the females are more than 50% of the population of the planet and finally they can start to pull their own weight. Females can work and earn profit, employers gets a new working force and merchants a lot of new customers. Literally everyone wins!

My problem is in with the last few episodes! There was a few very progressive movements and recently significant social reforms in the ferengi homeworld. Welfare programs, starting fundings and charity for poors, whats totally alien from the ferengi people and culture. Surely Quark dont like this, but even the Grant Nagus is position is weakened to reverse these things. So the ferengi rapidly changing big time, maybe changing a little too fast. There was no logical explanation for these changes in the ferengi values, aside from the writers clear message to the audience about progressing our real world society. But what is a good message about ourselves completely makes no sense in the point of view about the ferengi people, culture and economy.

They dont even try to explaine this rapid shift with some logic, like how these progressions help the ferengi to do what they do the best, earn more profit. Maybe something like making a new Rule of Acquisition: ‚ÄûYou can scam someone just only once, but you can earn profit from someone for a lifetime.‚Äù Making a clear message that ripped-off costumers will not come back, but with fair trade you can earn so much more money. Yes, the ferengi basically a loose caricature of the 21 century people who are overly obsessed with money and owning things. Nothing wrong with this or sending a few ethical message to the viewer, but changing their entire defining trait through 1 or 2 episode without clear explanation is a really big problem. Just show me why the ferengi people and society wants or needs these radical changes, and its driven by reasons not just human moral and ethical values.

My last problem that Zek choose Rom as his successor as the new Grant Nagus and the leader of all ferengi! Dont get me wrong I like Rom is character! Despite his dumb characterisation maybe he could be a fair and respected leader, just not a good one for ferengi! Honestly he dont showed any competent leadership or business capabilities, maximum making his not so successful strike in Quark is bar the only thing I can think of. I think it could have been a good episode on its own, Ishka manipulate Zek to choose his son Rom as the next Nagus but Quark for obvious reasons disagree and wants to prove he is the right choice. They start bickering about it and earn Zek is good side, but then Pel returns to also become the Nagus. But she shows up with a little fleet of goods from the gamma quadrant where she made a very big fortune with business.

I have been watching The Hollywood Reporter's top 25 TNG episodes (never watched anything star trek before), not with the intention to get hooked along the way, just to have a fun time. The episodes included are:

\- Encounter at Farpoint

 \- Skin of Evil

\- Conspiracy

\- The Measure of a Man

\- Deja Q

\- Yesterday's Enterprise

\- The Offspring

\- Sarek

\- The Best of Both Worlds

\- The Outcast

\- Cause and Effect

\- I, Borg

\- The Inner Light

\- Relics

\- Chain of Command

\- Trapesty

\- Frame of Mind

\- Paralells

\- Lower Decks

\- All good things

Things that surprised me: 1 I like Q and episodes with alternative timelines (something I thought I was gonna hate). 2 I like all the main characters.

Things that were really bad: 1 Klingons, they are so ugly and cheap looking it's hilarious. 2 If those three are season 1's best, then I understand why that season gets alot of (deserved) hate. 3 It looks awful in many places which I should have seen coming but sometimes it was hard to watch.

Protonyght,1613082335,lhwkg3,21,1,"I've been thinking a lot about the epsoide ""In the Pale Moonlight"" recently - and the more summaries or conversations I read about this episode, the more I feel like my interpretation of Sisko's final monologue differs from most people's interpretation.

It seems like the majority thinks that Sisko's statement ""I can live with it"" is actually honest and that he then deletes his personal log, because he doesn't need it anymore.
However, I personally believe that his whole monologue - including his claim that he could live with it - is in fact more like a lie that he tries to convince himself of, because he actually *can't* live with it. However, he fails to convince himself of it and he then finally decides to erase the log, realizing that there actually is no way to justify to himself what he did (and after all that was the main purpose of the log). And I think that this is also the reason why he doesn't drink from the glass and instead puts it back on the table - because he realizes that there is actually nothing to drink to.

mike31lro,1613066683,lhqjen,22,1,"1. Discovery just became the single most important asset in the known galaxy in the 32nd century. The most obvious reason is its Spore Drive. Firstly, the fact that it can instantly travel anywhere is game-changing at any period of time. Secondly, in view of the scarcity in the 32nd century, the Spore Drive presents an alternative and viable means of travel. This alone increased the Discovery's importance many times over. The thing that fascinates me about the drive is that, based on my understanding, it isn't as much of a technological advancement, as it is an innovative utilization, in that it does not create or produce anything new, but merely passes through an already existing pathway (Mycelial Network). It would be the equivalent of, say, us running out of fossil fuels, then finding out that our ancient ancestors travelled through continents by riding giant eagles. However, in my opinion, the drive is only the second most important of Discovery's features

2. What I believe is the principal value of Discovery is the Sphere Data, which contains at least 100,000 years of information. I'm surprised this isn't something that was recognized by anyone this season, given that its preservation was the reason they travelled into the future. While the Federation has had almost a thousand years of significant advancement, that amount of time is still but a small fraction of the knowledge within the sphere. It could have data on alternative fuel types, or maybe other galaxy wide transportation methods used by older civilizations. I'm sure it can provide more guidance other than team-building techniques and secret locations of temporal doorways.

3. I'm actually not surprised that the Vulcans left the Federation. They have always had a sense of self-superiority and disdain towards other races, most notably the unpredictable humans, behind that veneer of emotionless faces. Spock himself was a victim of prejudice from pure Vulcans because of his human heritage. They co-founded the Federation mostly out of utility, and I think when they realized after The Burn that it was more work than it was worth, (I sense a small ""I told you so"" moment) they did the logical thing and simply left.

4. Also I'd like to see how Tellar Prime is doing. It is the only Federation founding world unaccounted for. Earth was practically abandoned; the Andorians formed a syndicate; and the Vulcans yeeted out.

5. The encounter on Earth was refreshing, where issues were actually resolved through means beyond the firing of phasers. 

6. Discovery's entry to the new Starfleet headquarters is a bit cringey. The recurring  trait of the crew is their inability to perform professionally. In that scene, they were portrayed similar to how school children would in the Smithsonian. A basic rule is ""show, don't tell"". The perfect example is in the 2009 Kelvin timeline movie, when Bones and Kirk were in the shuttle, flying towards the Enterprise. The music, the cinematography, and the stunned silence of the characters served to paint the epic proportions of the space vessels.

7. Michael's romance was handled really well in this season. The trouble that could be encountered in any show, is the presence of chemistry, of connection, between the two characters. The ideal romance is one that does not make you want to tear your eyes off everytime you see them have a moment. I honestly felt that Michael and Tyler as a couple were a bit off. For me, Michael and Book were actually charming to watch.

8. Philippa's diagnostics actually had more implications than was shown. According to the old scientist guy, every molecule fights to go back to the time it originated, as they were only meant to exist in a certain universe, with a certain time. I think that, while Philippa was the most severely affected because of her unique circumstances, the rest of Discovery's crew is not yet off the hook. We might see the issue arise in the next season. 

9. I was afraid at first that Admiral Vance was just gonna be a viciously corrupt, or alternatively, a dangerously self-righteous starfleet admiral. His advice to Saru, and how he handled Ossyra showed otherwise. I like how most of his scenes subtly demonstrate his soundness, wisdom, experience, and dedication to duty.

10. I also admire the season's well-portrayed antagonists. Zareh was the typical bully: smug, haughty, and abusive. The actor did an excellent job of instantly making the character as having the most punchable face in the entire series. Ossyra, however, cunning and manipulative, was a true threat. It's a pity that Georgiou was taken before Ossyra entered the picture. A fight between the two of them, either commanding their ships, or hand-to-hand, is a show I'd give all the dilithium in the galaxy to watch. It would have been like Napoleon and Wellington.

11. Going back to the Sphere, it is quite odd how easily the ship's systems were overtaken, considering that it is the same one that basically took control of all Discovery's systems in season 2. It shouldnt be possible that it could just be gone into hiding so simply.

12. Tilly, as smart and capable as she is, is not fit for a commanding position. Saru is correct, that she has the heart, but she needs a lot more refinement to be able to focus properly during crises.

13. I'm quite sure the Ni'var would have had the sufficient data from their multiple and widely dispersed SB19 sensors to come up with the same results Discovery had. Any minute differences recorded by the mere three black boxes recovered by Michael should also reflect in the recordings of the Ni'var sensors, unless they were unusually lax in their analysis.

14. I have mixed feelings about the cause of The Burn. I feel like it is off and anti-climactic, considering everything the Federation went through like the Borg, the Dominion, Temporal wars, and other yet unnamed conflicts which undoubtedly happened in the last hundreds of years. On the other hand, it was also apt in many aspects. the cause was so small and insignificant, in a galactic sense, that only it could have brought the Federation down. And while the whole galaxy could discount it as trivial, for Su'kal, it represented his whole world. 

15. One more thing I love is the overall theme of the season, which is connection, that the right move is to reach out and establish connections, instead of closing yourself in. We were shown examples as in the cases of Earth, Trill, and Ni'var, who shut themselves out of the galaxy. However, like Saru's dinner, and Su'kal's opening to the outside, reaching out made them stronger in the face of difficulties.

16. I am pleasantly surprised by Michael and Saru's swift reversal of roles. It was heavily hinted that Michael no longer felt beholden to starfleet, and that her brief taste of freedom from the carrying the weight of an entire ship changed her significantly. I thought that by the end of the season, she would leave Discovery to help rebuild the Federation in her own way, away from the rigidity of the regulations. However, at the end, it was she who found her way further in the organization, and it was Saru who ""needed the time"" to reflect upon his next choices.

17. I do hope we get to see more of the new Starfleet ships in the next season. We barely get more than a jumbled view of them. I hope there is an Enterprise somewhere, like Enterprise-X, although that would imply an Enterprise-W, which doesn't really work. 

18. Furthermore, I hope we get to see more of the individual crew. the problem with the bridge crew is that they're always grouped together, it's easy to make them forgettable. Detmer and Owo did get a few moments of their own, but it's still not enough to consider them memorable.

19. Also, try to find a new catchphrase for jumping to warp lol.",startrek,Just finished watching ST Discovery Season 3. Here are some of my thoughts,7819,1332,5.87012012012012
WaveMonkey,1613065586,lhq448,45,1,"Let's say the people of a planet were tired of the constant war and chaos in space.  Because space is a nightmare.  There are very few episode in star trek where they go somewhere and they aren't shot at.  And then you have the natural hazards and space anomalies that make space a nightmare.  Space anomalies that pop up out of nowhere and drive people insane, crazy space entities, whacky transporter malfunctions that most likely wouldn't happen in normal circumstances, etc.  And then of course you have the borg and dominion.  People from the other side of the galaxy that leave destruction everywhere they go.  So let's say they took one look at starfleet's mission reports and decided to adopt a siege mentality.  Because space is crazy.

So they build the best warships and the best planetary defense system that they could.  They build weapon platforms in orbit and surface to space cannons on the ground.  And if they could acquire the technology a planetary shield.  And a minefield.  A cloaked minefield  So that anyone who approached their planet would hit mines and be destroyed.  They could leave one way clear of mines so that their ships and friendly ships could still leave.  And move the mines every now and then to change it so no one finds out about it.   Do you think this is a valid strategy for keeping the hostile aliens at bay.  Would it work against the borg or dominion.

* I get to see the evolution of the transporter from cargo only to humans
* I get to see phasers being installed and improved upon (and used)
* I get to see force fields being developed and refined
* I also happen to like hearing Archer say ""Polarize hull plating!""
* I get to see EVEN MORE of Jeffrey Combs, as he's also playing a Ferengi in addition to Shran!
* Plus there's Ethan Philipps in that same episode!
* And the next episode has Ren√© Auberjonois!

#3 Last but not least in TNG episode 'Yesterdays Enterprise' Picard admits that the war with klingons was going bad and the federation is on the brink of a colossal defeat .

MoreGaghPlease,1613024585,lhemvf,18,1,"I've been putting my mind lately to different possible ways to watch Star Trek. There are issues around airdate, production date, chronological order, and series order. None of them truly capture all of what I'm looking for in a watch order: one that shows the story in the order it was mostly intended to be seen, without too much switching between series, and keeping a sequence meant to convey meaning.

I've put together a somewhat unconventional list. It's neither airdate nor production date nor series order, but takes elements of all of them. I'll describe it below with reasons for each switch, and then place a massive table with the whole list.

Like gagh, it's a little squirmy. But not too squirmy.

* The Cage

 * Even though it didn't air until the 1980s on TV, it's Trek's start and so the start of our journey

* TOS in production order

 * I think on the balance, production order better captures the creator's intent than air order, especially in season 1 where Where No Man Has Gone Before very clearly takes place before the rest of the season.

* TAS in airdate order

 * there wasn't much reason to put these in production order, and I think it's easier since this is the order they appear in DVDs and streaming

* Films 1-6

 * While 5 &amp; 6 aired during TNG, I feel they continue and wrap up the story of Kirk and crew, and should be stuck together

* TNG Encounter at Farpoint through to Chain of Command, Part 2

 * Using airdate for simplicity. I think there are some good arguments about production order for season 1, because it puts 11001001 before The Big Goodbye, but overall I think airdate works best.

 * Chain of Command was written intentionally to re-introduce the Cardassians and set the stage for DS9. Switching to DS9 here means that when DS9 character Quark and Bashir show up in season 6 and 7 of TNG we will have met them first on their own shows

* DS9 Emissary to Blood Oath

 * Using airdate here. The only real controverys is with respect to Past Prologue vs A Man Alone, and honestly it doesn't really matter. Past season 1, airdate I think always represents the writer's intent.

* TNG Ship in a Bottle to Journey's End

 * We have switched back to TNG to give greater context to the emergence of the Maquis

* DS9 The Maquis, Part I &amp; Part II

* TNG Firstborn to All Good Things...

* Star Trek Generations

 * Although it does take place a bit later, there's no reason to seperate it from the rest of TNG here

* DS9 Bloodlines to Past Tense, Part II

 * We are stopping here to pivot to Voyager. I wanted to stop at a natural pausing point in DS9 and also think about the state of the Federation when Voyager is lost. Things like the status of the Maquis, how much they'd know about the Dominion, etc.

* VOY Caretaker to Coda

 * The Borg do not appear on Voyager until after the film First Contact, which made some changes to them as a threat and as a people. So we pause now to wait for that film.

* DS9 Life Support to Ascent

 * Stopping here mostly because I didn't want to rob First Contact of its introduction of the new uniforms, and because if we go much further in DS9, it'll spoiled when it's mentioned by In Purgatory's Shadow

* Star Trek: First Contact

* Voyager: Unity to Waking Moments

 * Stopping here because going further spoils the outbreak of the Dominion War

* DS9 Rapture to Inquisition

 * Stopping here so that when the EMH IV says 'the Romulans aren't in the war' it is still true

* VOY Message in a Bottle to The Voyager Conspiracy

 * I like this run a lot, because it goes from Voyager's first quick contact with home until just before regular contact. Pathfinder clearly takes place post-war, so we're pausing until after DS9

* DS9 In the Pale Moonlight to It's Only a Paper Moon

 * Also a run I like thematically. This is a 'cost of war' chunk. 

* Star Trek: Insurrection

 * Placement is somewhat controversial. I think this is a good place for it because, Worf is mostly absent from It's Only a Paper Moon, it's a relative lull the war, and it comes before the Son'a get mentioned in DS9

* DS9 Prodigal Daughter to What You Leave Behind

* VOY Pathfinder to Endgame

* Star Trek Nemesis

 * Although it was released mid-ENT, I think it's better here as we wrap up this era of Trek and also conclude Janeway's story (at least in live action...)

* ENT by airdate

* The Kelvin Films (ST09, STID, STB)

* Discovery season 1

* Short Treks season 1

* Discovery season 2

* Short Treks season 2

* Picard season 1

 * Placing Picard before DSC 3 I think adds necessary context to the Ni'var episode

* Lower Decks season 1

* Discovery season 3

Are we supposed to imagine that the ship looked just the way it was in TOS, and then its refit, overhaul, or whatever we want to call it was just that huge and that its appearance was so transformed? Its like they replaced 50% if the ship, and added stuff too. Even the interior is transformed. Admiral Kirk is not sure which way he's going when he walks down a corridor in TMP.

In a way, it would have made so much more sense if they just said they built a new ship and called THAT ship NCC-1701-A.

‚ÄúWait, what? Did I miss anything? Why now?‚Äù That‚Äôs what you may be asking yourself. Okay, here‚Äôs the deal: 

[Link to the discussion thread of the Pilot, Episode 1&amp;2, ‚ÄúBroken Bow‚Äù.](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/lecfvf/star_trek_enterprise_season_1_episode_1_broken/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Now that any new Star Trek is on a break again, I went back to my very first Star Trek show, the one that pulled me in. I know I‚Äôm a bit of a rarity here with that, but I began with watching Star Trek: Enterprise first. I loved the premise and really liked the crew, and it pulled me in. Next I watched Voyager, and then TNG and finally DS9. I also watched a few episodes of TOS, but couldn‚Äôt really get into it. I‚Äôll try again soon. I love how each show is fairly distinct and unique. While I think DS9 is the best show with the best characters (followed very very closely by TNG), ENT has a special place in my heart. I recently began watching it again and somehow wondered what this sub would say in the weekly discussion thread about each episode. And since the new shows are currently on a break, I figured I‚Äôd ask you guys to watch the show with me. 

So join me. Watch ENT with me from the beginning and discuss it here. 

The rules for this will be the same as for the official weekly discussion thread for any new shows on here, with one addition: if you watch quicker than we do, or if you already know the show, do not spoil anything that doesn‚Äôt happen up to the current episode. 
Now, I‚Äôm not a mod. I can‚Äôt enforce this, but I trust you‚Äôll be good sports for this, okay? 

Since I am not a mod, this won‚Äôt be stickied, so I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense to wait a week between posts. I think I‚Äôll post on Saturdays and on Wednesdays, so twice a week. I hope that‚Äôs okay for everyone. You can follow me and check my posts if you like, so you can always find the last post. 

Maybe this‚Äôll just die in new and just not happen, but if you decide to come along, enjoy the ride :)

ardouronerous,1612994762,lh59l2,43,2,"&gt;*Two months ago a Federation  starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.  We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety  precautions. The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their  ozone.  They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately fifty  Earth years. Due to their enormous military budget, the  Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this  catastrophe.  Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador I opened a dialogue  with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He proposes to  commence negotiations at once.* \- Spock (Undiscovered Country

From the looks of things, Qo'noS was in trouble, 50 years of oxygen left, the Klingon race and culture was on the verge of annihilation. So why was Chang and the rest of his Klingons cohorts against making peace treaty with the Federation?

Also, one of Chang's men says:

&gt;*In any case, we know where this is leading. The annihilation of our culture.*

The Klingon race and culture were on the verge of annihilation already. In 50 years, the Klingons would die off anyway.

Warphoenix1,1612985054,lh1gfo,21,2,"...that an episode with a reasonably interesting premise and buildup has such a bad case of plot armor at the end, even by Trek standards. I really like the idea of the episode; that a group of scared cadets can fall victim to a cult of their leader's hubris. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief that a ship could survive behind enemy lines at warp &lt;4 for months. I love the idea that there's this amazing buildup to a plan that just fails.

But I'm SO SICK of Trek episodes having everyone, **everyone** die other than the main characters. My suspension of disbelief can maybe believe that the ship can last for minutes while it's being assaulted by a Dominion battleship, I guess. Maybe the entire rest of the bridge crew dies, fine. But that Nog and the acting chief have time to get to Jake in the brig, get to an escape pod, and then they're the *only* pod that survives? The episode even goes out of its way to show the other pods being destroyed. It just takes me out of the episode that out of all 37 people on board, it was our 2 main characters and the one member of red squad that we have emotional attachment to that survive.

RemmitingFall,1612976638,lgy5vs,43,12,"During the third season of Star Trek: Discovery it is said that there hasn‚Äôt been a crossing with the mirror universe and the prime universe since the 27th century, but what exactly caused the rift between the universes is left vague.

My theory is that the Prime Universe and the Mirror Universe are no longer aligned because they are no longer mirrors of each other.

In the TNG episode ‚ÄúParallels‚Äù Worf is accidently transported to various other ‚ÄúQuantum Realities‚Äù. what‚Äôs interesting is that every reality he is transported to is only slightly different than the one he was just in. This suggests that it is easier to travel to universes that are more similar to your own.

If this fact is consistent with the mirror universe then it could explain away the nearly impossible state of the Terran Empire, where every person has a mirror despite the ludicrously low chance of the same egg and sperm combination occurring in too different universes, as when there are an infinite number of realities these impossible similarities will eventually happen and there are trillions of universes that didn‚Äôt quite match up.

So, what if the fact that the Mirror Universe has moved further away is due to the fact that the Federations‚Äô mirror, the Terran Empire, has collapsed and now differences in the two universes are beginning to be more apparent, and by the 27th century it‚Äôs got next to no parallels with the prime universe and crossings become virtually impossible.",startrek,Theory: The Mirror Universe is no longer a mirror universe.,1467,248,5.915322580645161

Once upon a time on the planet Ferenginar, a young Ferengi named Gint grew up in a poor family. His father often told him stories of the legendary Ferengi dream: to earn 1,000,000 strips of gold-pressed latinum in one's lifetime. Gint soon grew up, and, inspired by his father's stories, set out to make his own fortune.
Gint began as a peddler, traveling around Ferenginar selling various goods. He was quite successful, and soon he had earned 500,000 strips of gold-pressed latinum. Gint returned home to his family with his 500,000 strips of gold-pressed latinum. His father was so proud of him that he wept.
Unfortunately, Gint had spent all of his hard-earned latinum on various luxurious items and investments, and by the time he returned, he had only 100 strips of gold-pressed latinum left. His father was so angry at him for spending all of his hard-earned money on luxuries that he disowned Gint as his son.
Gint was devastated. He had no choice but to become a beggar on the streets of Ferenginar. He begged Ferengi citizens for spare change, but they all shunned him. After all, he had wasted his chance at becoming a self-made man.

TV series set in the Kelvin Timeline.

Set in the years between the destruction of the USS Kelvin and would showcase the development of the USS Enterprise and help explain why it looks so different to the TOS Enterprise

Show Pitch #3

TV series set in the Kelvin Timeline.

Would basically be the Kelvin timeline version of TNG.

Would follow Picard on the Enterprise D and how different everything is this far into the altered timeline.

mewhilehigh,1612814125,lfk7u8,45,1,"After watching ST: Discos Terra Firma, I went back and watched TOS: The City on the Edge of Forever.  So spoilers for that and Ent: In a  Mirror, Darkly, all of the DS9 Mirror Universe episodes., and DS9, Past Tense (Bell Riots) 

In City of Edge of Forever, Kirk has to make a choice to save Edith Keeler or let her die. If she lives, she goes on to bring pacifism to America, delaying US entry to WWII, allowing Nazis to get the A-Bomb first and conquer the globe. My theory is this decision creates the Mirrorverse divide. We know from Ent: In a Mirror, Darkly, that First Contact with Cochrane went differently. The Vulcan's arrived and instead of peace, humans offered death and power. This allowed humans, even after WWIII to overpower the Vulcans and conquer much of the quadrant. But why? Are humans just innate brutes in this universe? No, in DS9: Crossover we learn that Mirror Spock was successful in introducing a less hostile approach to the Empire, eventually leading to its collapse. We see in Terra Firma that Georgia changed her belief system in just her time in our universe. So why did Cochrane attack?

I believe because of the events of of Edith Keeler, humans lived a life seeing pacifism as evil. The Nazis conquered the world via brutality and that became the norm, especially for POC (important later). Next consider the Bell Riots. I think its safe to surmise that even in Mirror Universe this sort of event took place, in fact it may have been catalyst for WWIII/Eugenics war. In our time, Bell Riots take place 2024 and WWIII starts in 2026. What if the Mirror Uni Bell Riots was an uprising in one of the Nazi ghettos eventually leading to their overthrow and the establishment of a ""free"" earth but with all the brutal social constructs as a necessity guarding against the ""bad"" elements of facism. Now, genetic purity is no longer important and gives rise to the Discovery Mirror Universe where diversity is a part of life, POC from all over can kill their neighbor and claim their lands, Equality! 

(You can even speculate to Disco- Georgia arriving at a Pre-Mirror, Mirror Spock (whom she would have an uncanny familiarity with) and laying the groundwork for his decision to overthrow the Empire.)  

What does this have to do with DS9's Mirror archs? Julian Bashir. If my theory were true, the Mirror Universe would not have had a Eugenics War as the Nazi's would have merely celebrated the arrival of the perfect human. In fact, this is what may have lead to the creation of the Mirror ghettos that would spawn their Bell Riots. So after these events, and the establishment of the new Terra ideals of might makes right, I can see no reason to suspect Bashir would be augmented in the mirror universe (unless it was a cunning move by his father to create a leader capable of winning the Terran Resistance, this would explain Mirror Bashir keeping the Julian v. Jules name. I kinda like this cause it makes Bashir's Dad Mirror cunning instead of hapless).

The main gist of my thought was that the parasitic aliens in TNG's episode ""Conspiracy"", were perhaps distantly related to the Trill Symbiotes. Perhaps a very long time ago, the Conspiracy Parasites broke away from the Trill Symbiotes and travelled to live in another part of the galaxy (sorta like the Romulans broke away from the Vulcans) due to irreconcilable ideological differences.  The main differences beings as follows:

1. Trill Symbiotes prefer not to fully take over their host, but rather join together with them in an equal partnership (similar to Tok'ra in Stargate)
2. But the Conspiracy parasites want to completely take control of their host until nothing of the host remains (similar to the Goa'uld in Stargate)

Also if they're in a ""bubble"" surrounded by negative mass, how come other passing objects around them still affect them and so often throw the seated passengers off balanceüôÉ?

However. . . . are we not forgetting the events of Star Trek 2009?

The Federation actually put together what must have been a massive research and development project to design and implement a radical plan to save Romulus. Not just it's people, but the entire system, and with it, it's empire. Despite the loss of so many ships and lives, the Federation was actually willing to invest huge resources to intervene to help it's main rival, something that Picard (both the man and series) seems to ignore. It was only through some unforeseen circumstances that Spock was too late to save them.

Official_N_Squared,1612427273,lcb8te,28,10,"Like many, I hate Picard's mono-fleet. I can conceptually understand why Starfleet may want to transition to fewer ship classes, but I cannot accept that they would have a fleet entirely composed of a single state-of-the-art large class like that ready to mobilize. 20 years ago the Federation left the Dominion War and 10 years ago they lost Utopia Planitia and a huge fleet of ships. Starfleet should be desperate for starships and would easily use the remaining TNG/DS9-era ships, and maybe even some of the stronger TMP era ones as science vassals (though I don't think we should have seen those). Heck we even saw them bringing Disco era ships out of mothball in Children of Mars!

So what gets me the most is that the CGI team had a Galaxy class ship from the first episode. This also means that with very little effort they could have sliced it up and stitched together a Nebula class (as well as a few other kitbashes I'm sure I'm forgetting) that while not exceptional would easily be good enough for the background. And after seeing all the love and effort they put into Discovery's season 3 ships while working from home it just like they downright didn't care. Surly re-creating a Defiant or Akira, while a big task even for a background ship, is easier then designing a brand new ship. Something they then did loads of times for Discovery under worse circumstances. Even a 90% Inquiry fleet would have appeased me

Admittedly it would be a bit unusual to have that and no DS9 era ships, particularly a Galaxy and no Sovereign class. But that can be waved away with the old ""nearest ships"" argument and we could just say the Federation made very few Sovereign class ships before transitioning to the Inquiry class while the Galaxy class was much longer lived during a time of peace and bountiful resources. Sure people would have complained but more so then with the mono-fleet? This is Star Trek, some people will always complain about something. As it stood a lot of people spent the final scene going ""Oh my god why is there only one ship?!"" and many still don't really see the actually quite good design of that ship. Even then it took awhile for a lot of people to appreciate it (for me it wasn't until I saw the Eaglemoss model of it)",startrek,The worst part of the Picard mono-fleet is that they already had a few other ship classes in the modern CGI database,2252,403,5.588089330024814
uniqueme1,1612413463,lc7nh1,13,0,"I'm sure there are a multitude of posts like this, but I suppose I'll add my thoughts to the fray after finishing my Discovery binge. 

First off, I've been a trek fan for a long time. In order I like (excluding Disco and Picard), DS9, TNG, TOS, VOY and Enterprise. I even \*liked\* Enterprise.  I just rewatched all of them (thank you Netflix) and my DS9 love is cemented even further as is my appreciation of TNG and TOS.  To me, the characters are the most important thing, even more so the world building. All the best Trek has ultimately bloomed from the characters and their relationships. 

So I was willing to give Discovery a chance. S1 was interesting - I enjoyed the pace, a different take on the Klingons (although did they even bother retconning?) and getting to know characters like Saru. The over focus on Burnham has been well documented and I agree, although I think she had the acting chops to mostly shoulder the burden.   The spore drive was conceived by a writer that was high, no doubt - but I went with it.  Loved the inclusive and diverse nature of the crew, both in gender and in sexuality/identity.  It seemed natural and unforced, not gimmicky. 

S2 was a bit different, with a unifying story that mostly worked. (I like having a core story that's being told serially.) Pike saved the show, for me. He was a complete breath of fresh air.  I also really enjoyed seeing Saru mature as a leader and captain (in S2 and S3) He has his own distinct, laid back style which \*works\*. They added (and then deleted) an interesting character in Ariam. Again, there was a lot of style over substance, but enough substance to keep me engaged. I have a number of quibbles, but not enough for it to ruin it for me.   

S3, set 900 years in the future - THAT was an exciting prospect. Forget trying to integrate story lines within the existing canon and being boxed in by whats come before. Leap over the temporal wars, and come in with a clean slate. What an opportunity! 900 years is a long time - going back 900 years would send you to the 1100s. The difference in technology and society should have been huge, and the opportunities for storytelling infinite. 

But man, I was disappointed. Both by the story and the storytelling. Again, the Burnham show, but without strong characters like the other 2 seasons to counterbalance her.  But to me, it was a mess. A rush to solve a 150+ year mystery? The revelation of what the Burn at the end was laughable. (We spent all season to find THAT out?)  There were some nice flashes of technology, but nothing that seemed like ""magic"", as 22nd century technology would have seemed to someone from the dark ages.  Floaty nacelles and holographic combadges non-withstanding. 

And the characters. Ossyra - the big bad - turns out just to be really a thug. I was hoping that this was an opportunity to maybe explore how societies change - ala' Asmiov's Foundation series - and maybe the Federation morphs into something less righteous and more ... pragmatic? Something to show not just the technological shifts, but how \*societies\* change over almost a millenia? Again, touches of that - Vulcan's transformation, for example. (And that part was fascinating!) But Earth's San Francisco Bay looks like someone in the 1950's would have imagined 2020. 

And by Season 3 we should know more about the crew. Tig Notaro is just there for comic relief (although I do love her). I couldnt tell you - besides Detmer and Stamets and Tilly- the names of the other crew. Detmer had generic PTSD, gets over it - okay.  And the fault isnt with the actors, I think they didnt have a ton to work with.  There was room for more, if they took out completely tangential (and half-assed) story lines like Adira and the Trill.  Tilly - an \*ensign\* over everyone else for number 1?  What?   

I can deal with a bad show. But it's really disappointing that an opportunity was lost to set a bold direction.  Resurrecting the Federation isn't it.  It's like the writers sit in a room and think, ""Hey this is cool!"" without thinking it through. That's how ""Lost"" became so ""Lost"" and I'm afraid that's where Discovery is heading. (Maybe they'll wake up and it'll all be purgatory?)

""Please not again""

I'm a new fan. Only started watching TOS on Netflix for first time late last year, previously had only ever caught the tribbles episode and the episode with the blob creature thing in the mine with the silicone eggs on tv. Now seen them again obviously in full context.

Get to the point. ""Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise"" (looks like Ryan Gosling) may be one of the.. well in my opinion THE most under-appreciated character of TOS. But I dunno' I'm new to Star Trek so for all I know the fans give him big love.. but just from watching the show, and he's only in two episodes.. that's a shame. The guy was comedy gold in his first episode, freaking hilarious.. and then his second episode is so far the other way, delving deep into his tragic childhood and his thirst for vengeance. Such a great character for just two episodes.. &gt;!I was so relieved when he did not die in his second episode, as I felt like he might. !&lt;

Anyway the often light heartedness, occasional hilarity of this show really surprised me. I knew so little about Star Trek before, I did not realise it was such a funny show at times. Like in season 3 ""I'm tweedle-dee he's tweedle dum"" ""two spacemen marching to a drum""... that made me laugh so much, and McCoy watching, looking both freaked out and inappropriately amused. That scene was unnerving and creepy but also hilarious at the same time.

But nearing half way through season 3 (still not yet finished), still my most remembered line of dialogue is ""now ONE, MORE, TIME!"".. and since then whenever I'm going to do something again the line comes into my head, like ""aw heck I forgot something I gotta' get back up ONE, MORE, TIME!"" ... ""please not again"".

Love it.",startrek,"""Now ONE, MORE, TIME!""",1789,320,5.590625

To be clear, this is a pre-warp civilization.

I thought, wouldn't it be interesting if the were an episode where the Enterprise or the Discovery or the Defiant encountered an ark ship like that? (Was there such an episode?  I can't remember.)  Maybe on this ship the entire species is in stasis, or a small crew on the graveyard shift.  Either way, it's been on course for a particular Class-M planet for thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of years, but now that planet is a Federation member world.

How does the Federation starship deal with the situation?  It's a pre-warp civilization, so where does the Prime Directive fit in?  They probably wouldn't want to just destroy it, and even if they did it wouldn't be too easy as the ship would be incredibly armored just to survive the journey across realspace at sublight speeds.

I can see a lot of potential plotlines here.  They have to stop the ark ship from unleashing destruction on the Federation world, but not at the cost of wiping out the pre-warp species.",startrek,"An encounter with an ""ark ship""?",1463,249,5.875502008032129

There evolution has made them strong to withstand this and be able to go days without eating or drinking. Though it is also said they have a faster metabolism than humans and expel toxins from their bodies faster. That already bumps together but that may be due to some sort of thing their bodies have to separate the toxins from food and water. My question is actually  why do they consume so much. I have seen T'Pol consumes human amounts of food muiltiple times a day with Archer. It makes sense if she does it to follow our custom at eating at certain times but she eats our amount of food. T'pol is really skinny though where would she put the big amounts of food she consumes. She does not need that much food yet she eats a lot.

I wish they had chosen to kill him off, replace him with Tuvok, and ideally add a new regular character.

The problem is not that the concept of Chakotay‚Äôs character was bad, it was awesome! A spiritual, former criminal, Native American first officer. The problem is Beltran did a horrible job portraying him. He was unable to bring any depth or emotion to him, he was nearly almost always monotone and when he had to show emotion he was horribly unbelievable. 
Chakotay was so bad that if you asked me what my favorite scene with him was I‚Äôd say I don‚Äôt have one.

Why the hell the producers cast Boring Beltran to play a character with so much potential is beyond me, I‚Äôm very disappointed, if they cast him better Chakotay had the potential to be an incredible primary character.

What do you think? Do you think Beltran got a bad rep and portrayed Chakotay well or that Chakotay was poorly cast and had the potential to be a much better character? Should the writers have done themselves a favor and killed him off, to replace him with a better character?

Harry Kim was also a snooze fest and it‚Äôs a shame they chose to fire Kes instead of Harry

[EDIT] added after more thought] The reason Chakotay was always so calm is because he was terrible at acting out more extreme emotions.

The main theme of the episode centers around Neelix confronting the scientist who created the weapon who killed 300,000 of his people including his family and in a sorrowful twist, his own cowardice.

Both he and Jetrel the Haakonian are working towards curing other Talaxians who have contracted an illness during the rescue effort, including Neelix. Neelix holds Jetrel accountable for being a monster, not knowing that Jetrel himself is extremely ill with the same disease. Jetrel claims to be unapologetic but realizes that what he did does indeed make him a monster of the worst kind. Which he realized when his wife could no longer stand to touch him. 

Unexpectedly Jetrel tranquilizes Neelix and flees sick bay to attempt to truly fix what he did, he wants to bring the slaughtered Talaxians back from the dead. In the end it turns out Neelix is not sick at all but was needed by Jetrel to try and do so to prove that he is NOT a monster. 

They agree to move forward and attempt to bring the Talaxians back to life. It is a horrendous failure. Upon seeing that his life‚Äôs work failed horribly Jetrel illness causes him to collapse from the disease realizing he will not be able to redeem his monstrous genocide before he dies. As he dies in the sick bay Neelix forgives him.

This episode is quite dark, involving the monstrous genocide of Neelix‚Äôs people. I believe it is a metaphor for the moral differences between war criminals and their victims. They study the interaction between these two characters in great depth: Neelix appears initially to simply hate Jetrel and is sickened by his apparent lack of empathy or guilt, while Jetrel seems quite cold explaining that although he created the weapon, it would have been created either way. 

In truth Neelix hates not just Jetrel for the deaths of the Talaxians, but himself, as it turns out he was a deserter in the war and would be dead had he not hidden. Jetrel is actually far more guilty than he acts and is in fact, traumatized and horribly ill, so much so that it is revealed that he is only holding on to try an experiment to bring his victims back to life. Upon seeing that he cannot do so he collapses and dies of grief seeing himself a monster.

The message here is that there is no black and white in war, while it initially appears that Jetrel is purely evil and Neelix purely a victim it is revealed throughout the episode that both characters are actually in moral shades of gray, with Neelix not being the hero he appeared to be and Jetrel not being the monster he appeared to be.

* Starfleet Headquarter and Picard getting visitor badge.

* The scene where the Starfleet Admiral is convinced to issue diplomatic permits.

* Lack of police: At no point does it ever occur to Soji to call the police after people break into her apartment and ""kill"" her boyfriend. For now this can be justified by a fail-safe triggering that causes her to avoid police and seek Picard.

* Lack of police 2: Disruptor fire on Earth should trigger monitoring system/satellites similar to the Star Trek 6 scene and immediately beam down a security team or beam up civilians from the vicinity or cast a temporal/stasis field on the location or something. Might be explained by Romulan cloak/suppression field.

* Lack of medics: A simple knife wound in the chest could easily be fixed by emergency medics beaming in, or beaming the boyfriend to a med bay. Again no life sign monitoring systems triggered. And Soji does not call medics. Still might be the fail-safe, but now it's getting more icky, because there should be a life-preserving protocol, even if she wants to avoid authorities.

* Lack of civil society: Soji walks/beams/flies with a head wound to Picard. How did nobody see it, be concerned about her and offer her help, or call police/medics?

* Lack of police 3 / Lack of medics 2: When Picard sees her and at the latest when she tells her about a crime, Picard should call the police/security/medics. Now there is no easy fail-safe excuse anymore. But again the sense of ""we are alone in this"" is perpetrated by the show.

* Lack of ""fire-department"": The sole mentioning of ""Mars has been burning for 10 years"" is a) ridiculous and b) further intended to give the sense that problems can't be fixed, things are just broken, nobody is competent enough and it all just sucks.

* Lack of journalistic integrity and ethics: Fox News ""reporter"" ""interviewing"" Picard. She was completely unworthy of appearing in a Star Trek show and is clearly modeled after a talking-head hack doing ratings-bait-n-exploit.

* Lack of police 4: Soji is sensing assassins incoming in the middle of Starfleet Archives. No thought is given to emergency beam-out, or calling security or raising defense shields/system/triggering an alert. Instead ""you are on your own"" they just run to the roof.

* Lack of police 5 / Lack of medics 3: Explosion on the roof of Starfleet archives, show shows no investigation, follow-up, fall-out and doesn't even show the medics that supposedly bring Picard home, we are just supposed to guess what happens. Nobody asks Picard about his injuries or why he was there. Just Nothing. Just ""cut to bed"".

* Lack of security arrangement: Riker's home apparently has no civilization-level treaties, organizations or security forces to ensure the planet's safety as indicated by the mentioned raids going on and by the fact that he has to have a home-security system. Again there is ""nobody there"" and ""you have to rely on yourself because civilization has failed around you""

* Lack of Starfleet support: Picard doesn't get his minimal ship and crew.

* Lack of support network / treatment / post-scarcity: Raffi on drugs in a ""hovel"", complaining about a chateau.

* Lack of law: Seven can just murder somebody. No one cares. No investigation. No charge. No extradition. No governor or administrator calling anybody. No diplomatic incident. No trial. Complete break-down of civilization and post-apocalyptic Mad Max anarchy.

* Lack of law 2: Jurati can just murder somebody. Again there needs to be an investigation if only to find her incapable to stand trial because of impaired judgement from mind-meld rape.

* Lack of regard for Federation/Intergalactic science teams on the Borg cube: At some point they just disappear magically and nobody cares.

* Lack of Romulan authorities: At no point does the Romulan government/officials get involved in any of this.

* Lack of general morals, ethics, checks and balances and the state of law in Starfleet/Federation policy: Apparently the Federation has devolved into some sort of Stalinist dictatorship, where ""Black Flag Orders"" are on the books and the assassination of foreign dignitaries can just be ordered without questions or review and Starfleet Command can just remotely blow up Starfleet ships with all people (and children?) on board if orders are refused.

Conclusion: The show is laden with a sense of ""no civilization"" or a ""broken civilization"" or a ""failed civilization"". Which is the antithesis of Star Trek, because Star Trek is about a utopian civilization.",startrek,The lack of civilization in PIC,4979,827,6.02055622732769

EvaWolves,1612277187,lax3uu,68,3,"I notice in recent years it seems like in backlash to how Roddenberry is worshipped as a genius artist, people who are a bit more into Star Trek than your casual fans have started to bash Roddenberry as being a hack who took up the spotlight of other creative artists esp various writers of the show.

I had one person tell me Roddenberry ripped off some old Western TV show and actually is responsible for TOS's being so weak in the first season but because he's the creator all credit goes to him even though he almost destroyed TOS into getting canceled early. Another person even uses Roddenberry's name as an example in other industry much like how Ho Chi Minh is called the George Washington of Vietnam. Specifically he stated that Naoko Takeuchi, author of Sailor Moon, is the Roddenberry of anime/manga since Sailor Moon's  popularity came from the anime adaptation and because Naoko created the original manga she gets all the credit as genius and the various people who worked on the anime are unknown for their hard devotion to the series. That Naoko is a really bad artist and storyteller and so she deserves to be called a Roddenberry (in response to how this specific Trekkie feels Gene is a very terrible writer and showrunner but the mainstream unfairly sees him as a genius while the real creative minds behind TOS and the Star Trek franchise have faded in obscurity).

I am very new to Trekkie, I just finished TOS back in August and have yet to start on TNG. So new that I only knew Star Trek by reputation and never seen anything related to it except on random documentaries and magazine covers. But I am skeptical at the treatment by people who are a bit more into the series than I am (yet aren't hardcore fans). Just for the simple fact their criticisms seem to come under the assumption that if you are the producer you just sit back and command people like a dictator while chilling drinking lemonade.

I know enough about the producer role from the Behind the scenes stuff of my other favorite shows like Charmed to know that even if other people are actually indeed responsible for stuff like improved writing after season 1 of TOS, that having the credit of producer isn't just some random thing thrown around like a cool honor but actually is a very stressful job full of responsibilities.

What is the reality? Could Roddenberry simply have come up wit the basic idea and tell it to someone else and other people would have turn Star Trek into a beloved franchise?

Hello, just beamed in :)

When TNG first aired I was around 5yo and from the start was absolutely obsessed. I wanted to live in this world of curiosity, community, and respect. I was a latchkey kid and got to do whatever I wanted after school and what I wanted to do was watch tv. 

I missed DS9 completely and was dissatisfied with VOY at the time. Watch a few TOS episodes and thought it was for ""old people"".

2 years ago i decided to go back and watch the entire franchise. In order of air date. From start to finish. I'm almost done Just finishing up the last 2 seasons of enterprise. (It's a long story.) 

It's a great journey and I highly recommend it. It's interesting bc you get this view of the culture in America at each point in history. You get to see an evolution of ideas, morals, and shifting power structures.

I'll definitely give a full report when I finish.

So far a few things I've noticed:
- TOS the sets and lighting in the show are fantastic! Kirk is also much deeper than I gave him credit for. The triple bromance between Kirk, Spock, and Bones is a favorite part of the show. 
- TNG will forever be ""home"" for me. Picard is always committed to truth and diplomacy when I think ""Star Trek"" for me its TNG.
- DS9 is SO GOOD! Wow! Fantastic story arcs wonderful deep characters,also, Garak is possibly THE most interesting character in the franchise. Also, I love how much Worf gets to grow on the station.
- Voyager too comfortable for me but I LOVE the characters. There are all these wonderful moment. Also, if I'm being honest, I'd want to serve under Janeway before any of the other captains.
- ENT... Ugh... I... I don't want to talk about it...
- Kelvin timeline is super fun and action packed it felt a bit blockbustery but I'm down for the ride.
- DIS is absolutely beautiful, maybe the best looking of all the shows. I love the representation as well. Characters are wonderful and some of the ideas they came up with are super interesting. And let's be honest, you had me at Doug Jones.
- PIC was a fun ride as well, there's a lot going on. Some was not my jam, some was. I need a rewatch for sure.
- Lower Decks - so many references and I'm HERE. FOR. IT.

I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching these shows and movies. Very excited to check out this sub.

But from watching in the past where Enterprise dabbles in the Mirror Universe and seeing Star Trek First Contact countless times, I knew the connections, but didn't think really hard about it before until the last couple of days.

**Obviously spoilers ahead, so if you hate those, stop reading now and go elsewhere. Come back after you're caught up.**

**First Contact:**
Borg go back to First Contact with the Vulcan's to stop it. ENT E follows suit and stops them.... All the while filling Zefram Cochrane's brain full of a positive future and everything is wonderful.

Zefram¬†Cochrane meets the Vulcans, shakes their hand and then gets drunk with em. Happy Days. 

**Enterprise MU Divergence:**
Zefram¬†Cochrane meets the Vulcans, pulls a gun, Gatz the Ma'fakkas and then takes their ship and technology. Happy.. Erm, yikes I guess.

And that's all I ever thought about it.

Silly Mirror Universe, ¬Ø\_ („ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

But after years now, I only started actually thinking, ""Why?""

Why did he just gun them down after everything that just happened? Picard, the Borg, Astronauts on some sorta Star Trek?

What made him think they were invaders or some crap after already being told they were ""good guys?""

Why didn't the crew just go, ""whoops, we fk'd that up didn't we? Make another time portal and go back a few hours. Take 2.""

Because when Cochranes shot the Vuulcans, he was never told all that good stuff, because the Enterprise E never went back in time, because the Borg never did.

If the Borg didn't go back in time to stop First Contact in the first place, Cochrane would have shot the Vulcan's and eventually the Terran Empire would rise, instead of the Federation.

And the Federation defeated them multiple times, fatally so.

By the time the Borg would reach the MU Earth, the Terran Empire would be no more and Earth would be easily assimilated. (what Picard and crew saw in the rift before they went in to stop the sphere) 

The Borg not only screwed themselves into inevitable defeat by their own actions, but the Mirror Universe is technically the ""Prime Universe."" Everything we have been following and watching has been because of the actions of the Borg and Enterprise E.

hudi2121,1612162761,l9x808,24,0,"It‚Äôs been a few weeks now since Disco‚Äôs season finale so I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be spoiling anything for most people. 

With that said, the entire season was a stretch. I mean common, the burn that apparently killed millions and disrupted FTL travel for billions more was caused by a single, for all intents and purposes, normal being. I tolerated that but honestly what kind of really put me off was that turbo lift scene near the end. I mean seriously, I know this ships are supposed to be massive but, Disco is microscopic compared to the Ent-D and we saw nothing on that scale in TNG, even on the ships schematics on the consoles, there is nothing that implies a space like this exists. I know this was shown on the Kelvin Ent but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the physical dimensions provided for the ship vs the on-screen implied dimensions.

Maybe I‚Äôm just being nit picky but I feel that trek has taken too many random one-off scenarios to answer certain problems (‚Äúresurrection‚Äù serum for Kirk, advanced tech for voyager, picards new android body, etc).

I know it‚Äôs all fiction but I feel like there is such a thing like fiction in fiction and the writers have used it too many times over the years as plot devices, a means to a quick ending, visual effects, etc. I would like to see less one solutions that are never talked about again or writing that is reflective of provided canon information and I would like to think I‚Äôm not the only one.",startrek,Why do writers feel the need always stretch the already imaginative to completely unrealistic??,1445,262,5.515267175572519

I click on it and boom, I‚Äôm watching TNG reruns, just like it‚Äôs 1998 all over again. Commercials and everything. 

I usually kind of remember not digging episodes and movies that Center around kids but this time around I was like ‚ÄúWoah‚Äù. The big part that hit me was when Alexander was in art class working on his little art project, some weird Klingon thing for Worf. So Alexander is there doing his thing, when the ghost imaginary alien friend fucks with him and messed up his ashtray thing, and it kind of fucked with him in a significant way. Like in the episode it kind of displayed that he wasn‚Äôt being a weirdo Klingon kid, he was legit just doing his thing in school until he got fucked with inexplicably.

SirGumbeaux,1612159199,l9wb6p,238,70,"I‚Äôm looking forward to this series immensley. I hope this series does for Trek what the Mandalorian did for Star Wars, which is to unify the fanbase. That is a high set of expectations I know, but based on what I‚Äôve seen, they are heading in the right direction.

What the Mandalorian did well was a few things. One, they went back to their roots. They got back into the original sandbox of Star Wars. Two, they made the stories smaller. Every episode doesn‚Äôt need the universe to hang in the balance. Three, good characters. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Give me at least 3 characters I can ride or die with. That‚Äôs pretty much it. 

The reason I think they have a chance to do something special is, if you‚Äôve seen Pike, Spock &amp; Number One on Disco, chances are you‚Äôre in love already. I‚Äôm a TOS man, and I am in love so far. I know their version of the TOS Enterprise isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcanon‚Äù as far as how it looks now, but I love it. I haven‚Äôt loved a Trek ship this much since the 1701 &amp; 1701-A. 

They‚Äôve also said they‚Äôll be doing an ‚Äúemotional serialized‚Äù arc for a season, meaning if someone loses a loved one, that isn‚Äôt conveniently forgotten by the next episode, but they would go back to the ‚Äúalien of the week‚Äù type Trek. I think this could be the sweet spot they‚Äôve been looking for. Modern serialized storytelling is great. I‚Äôm a big fan, but the drawback is, individual episodes on Disco are harder to recall what scene happened in which episode. TOS is very clear cut. ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs the episode with two Kirks‚Äù LOL. Just an observation.

That‚Äôs pretty much it. I‚Äôd like to hear if anybody else has good vibes from this or what.",startrek,Strange New Worlds: Expectations,1637,304,5.384868421052632

9: Star Trek I: The Motion Picture. Slow, very slow. the plot is pretty straight forward, but it probably would have been better as show (which is what it originally was supposed to be)

8: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Okay, I &amp;amp; V almost hit 9, BUT, I believe that this movie was pretty straight forward, the plot was...fine, I guess? But the thing I liked about it, was the fact that Spock (Spoiler Ahead!) &amp;gt;!had a half brother!&amp;lt;.

7. Star Trek VII: Generations. I don‚Äôt have much to say about this movie, other than I didn‚Äôt like the Nexus thing, I understand it, I just don‚Äôt understand how it changed the destruction of the Enterprise.

6: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. This is by far the best uneven numbered Star Trek film, it would‚Äôve made #5, but I enjoyed the next film a little bit more

5: Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. This movie is weird, like very weird, if you like weird, you‚Äôll enjoy this quite a bit. The best thing about this movie is the comedy, this is probably the funniest Star Trek movie made.

4: Star Trek VIII: First Contact. This movie gives an origin story to basically Star Trek, the plot is good, but the only thing keeping it from the #3 spot, is the lac of an original character.

3: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. This is arguably the best Star Trek film. The thing keeping it from one of the top 2 spots is ‚Äòforgetting who was in the original episode‚Äô (Space Seed), at one point in the movie, Khan says to Chekov: ‚ÄúI never forget a face.‚Äù The thing is, Chekov wasn‚Äôt in the episode, in fact, Chekov didn‚Äôt even show up until season 2. Other than that, this would, and should share the #2 spot

2: Star Trek X: Nemesis. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I love this film, I just finished watching it about 20 minutes ago, and I really like it, is it better than II? No, absolutely not. The thing that makes me like it more, is (Spoiler Ahead!) &amp;gt;!Picard‚Äôs clone, and how it shows how the same person could turn out.!&amp;lt;

1: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered County. This was a great ending to the original cast‚Äôs story. The story about the Klingons capturing Kirk, and putting him on trial, and then putting him and McCoy in the mines. I stand by this being my favorite Star Trek film, and none of you can change that.

That said, in Sins of the Father I've always felt that Riker was a better choice as cha'DIch for Worf.  It comes later on, but Worf relies on Riker for the Klingon suicide ritual in Ethics, and Riker says he would've done it if he didn't recognize Worf was wussing out and not relying on his son like Klingon law states.  Worf also even offers to later join Riker if he were to leave the Enterprise in The Outcast.  Picard served as Riker's best man in Nemesis, which was done for fairly obvious reasons I suppose, but I felt given their relationship Worf would definitely be a solid choice.  Seeing Riker and Worf together trying to save Alexander and that little pet...snake...thing... was another great scene.  Or Riker calling Worf sexist for saying the dress uniform looks feminine, or telling Worf he hates surprises as he conspires to set up a surprise birthday party, the list goes on and on.

I guess what I'm trying to say is they have a great relationship, and it's really enjoyable to watch, and even as a kid I felt Riker was the clearer choice as cha'DIch for Worf.  Younger, extremely capable fighter, and experience around Klingons given the exchange program from before.  So why Picard?  I can only suppose Patrick Stewart was more the lead character and it was another stepping stone to Picard interacting and solidifying a relationship with a member of his senior staff.  I've considered as well that Frakes had fewer combat roles than perhaps his character suggested because of his back difficulties.  There is also the fact it lent some solid interaction to Worf and Picard's characters in First Contact.

I dunno, I guess another perspective outside of my skewed childhood one is all I'm looking for here.  What are other people's thoughts?  Thanks!",startrek,Was Picard the right choice for Worf's cha'DIch?,2154,374,5.759358288770054
bflaminio,1612114234,l9h3kv,28,14,"Assignment: Earth was the last episode of season 2 of TOS, and designed as a back-door pilot for a show that didn't get picked up, and as such it exists as kind of a strange non-Trek Trek episode in the canon.

TV has changed a lot since 1968, and I was thinking it may be time to revisit the adventures of Gary Seven, Roberta Lincoln, and their strange cat Isis (although given recent history she may need to be renamed).

Of course, the idea on an alien guy and his attractive companion traveling through time to fix history has been plumbed pretty deep by *Doctor Who*, but there still may be space for such adventures in the Trek universe.",startrek,"Would you watch an ""Assignment: Earth"" series?",643,119,5.4033613445378155

CrimsonThrawnVideos,1618787081,mtnqlr,6,1,"*Spoilers for The Clone Wars*

We assume there will be a lot of time with Kenobi brooding alone and thinking about what he's been through and there's two scenes I would love to see happen.

The first is a flashback scene to Obi-Wan's time spent with Satine, with Bo-Katan in it too.

Second is a scene with Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahoska discussing the events of the Mortis arc. 

We know Obi-Wan and Satine lovers but I think it would help to see them while they were together. This would make rewatching the Mandalore scenes in The Clones Wars even more meaningful and help explain why Kenobi is so depressed after Order 66 (one of many reasons). I would also like to see a de-aged Katee Sackhoff playing a younger Bo-Katan because why the hell not. She has her scars from Mandalore too and this could help viewers empathize with her in whichever future shows she appears in. Maybe she makes some sassy remark to Satine and Obi-Wan or she actually be confrontational depending on when it takes place.

For the second (and more important scene), I want to see Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka kick some ass then talk about what happened on Mortis. There were rumors/leaks about a possible Clone Wars era flashback and I think this would be a great choice for it. The three characters are the only ones who were aware of what they went through on Mortis and they never talked about it again, as far as we know.

This would take place in either season 4 or 5, after the Mortis arc but also before Ahsoka leaves the order. She would, of course, be played by either a de-aged Rosario Dawson with a younger body or just a younger actess altogether (but I'd prefer a de-aged Rosario). 

The scene would be Anakin and Obi-Wan arguing about something then Ahsoka chimes in, reminding them about what happened on Mortis. She would be frustrated that they won't talk about it and keep pressing them. Anakin and Obi-Wan would roll their eyes at first but then give in and fianlly talk about it. Maybe they're destroying some battle droids before the conversation.

Just like with Bo-Katan, this scene would help develop the guilt Ahoska feels and it could tie into her series.

This gives us our Clone Wars flashback scene, while also bringing attention to an important storyline. MOST importantly though, showing them talking about the prophecy of Anakin falling to the dark side (more or less) would help convey the guilt that Obi-Wan feels about Anakin.",StarWars,Two flashback scenes I want to see in the Obi-Wan Kenobi series,2436,429,5.678321678321678

I promise you, it's everything you would have wanted. Even the tragic parts, the stuff you hate to see happen, is light-years ahead of the story that replaced it. But yeah, is there a place, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Wait... You kids still read books, right? Well... If not, the old games are Cannon with the Legends timeline, so that's pretty cool if you get into the classics.

Characters cancelled or left in their own single story finally got a second chance, and the promise of what's next finally comes to something, even if you don't like it.

Aside from introduction of Bariss, both the Zillo Beast arc and the Droid Factory arc are pretty stand alone and you’d have no way to place them in the overall chronology.

This being the case, why is the chronology such that we have to watch Zillo Beast (from the end of season 2) before Droid Factory (end of Season 2)?

I think it’s because we’re supposed to remember the impenetrable skin of the Zillo beast which we know Palpatine wanted to weaponize.

During Droid Factory episodes:

We learn the super tank is a secret weapon

Only prototypes exist at this one droid factory

There armor is completely impenetrable

[This is where I got the idea for the original panels from Dr. Sci-fi](http://drscifi.com/blog/dswall)
2 4x8’ 1/4” birch plywood panels
10 2x4s
4 2x2s
64 feet of led lights
2 4x8’ panels of 2447 white translucent acrylic
2 4x’ foot 3/4” sandeply plywood
2.5” and 2” cutting drill bits (I don’t know the proper name)
Jig saw
Hand saw
Plug in drill
Orbital sander 
1.26” neodymium magnets
1 gallon each (in order of decreasing darkness) Behr Binary Star, Intergalactic, Zero Gravity, Millenium Silver) paints
For the main panels I found a pdf template online. I then decided I wanted some depth so I attached this 3/4” plywood to the back walls via the studs by screwing them in. The angular bulkheads are attached to the main panels by strong magnets on top and just set next to them on the bottom. This way I can access the lights fairly easily. There is a 2x4 frame behind each large panel anchored into the wall studs. 

Things I’ve learned while doing this (I have hardly any carpentry skills):

Make sure your 2x4s are straight when you buy them. I didn’t and it made things complicated. 

When using a jigsaw on plywood, have the surface you want to be smooth facing away from you. The blade will tear up the surface facing you. 

Make a diagram on how you want to create things
I used a free computer program. 
Birch plywood is smooth but has a lot of holes that need to be filled or can cause cracking 

Countersink your magnets if possible for a more flush look (I need to go back and do this)

We never really got to see the sith in the same position as the jedi were  we only really got to see the empire which was cool but it was mostly just pew pew soldiers no actual sith training.

Enlightened_reject,1618674671,mst6tg,10,1,"Ok, so hear me out. Apparently the duel of the fates track we love so much has a symbolic meaning. Essentially, the song played when Qui Gon and Maul were fighting. It was a duel of the fates because it literally was going to decide Anakin’s fate. If Qui Gon won, Anakin would have had Qui Gon as a mentor, a person who was a father figure and who knew the importance of love and attachment and the deeper Jedi truths. Thus, Anakin would have been trained well in a style that actually suited him. 

If Qui Gon lost, then Obi Wan would teach Anakin. While Obi wan was also a good Jedi, he did not have the same fatherly presence as Qui Gon, and did not believe in the importance of attachment. He was prone to follow the rules of the Jedi rather than the essence. So, Anakin consistently internalized his pain.

Hello fellow Star Wars fans, I am a student at Ursinus College who is doing a project for my Anthropology class on the subculture of the Star Wars fandom. Right now, I am trying to get information from members of the Star Wars fandom on different aspects of the culture including any common beliefs and knowledge that you all share, and any fandom activities you participate in. I have created a Google Form with questions about these topics and I would appreciate it if people could take a few minutes fill it out. This form is completely anonymous however it does ask questions about your demographics, such as age, location, and gender, which will allow me to identify trends about the types of people most involved in this fandom. Thanks for your time, and may the force be with you.

Why walk in there and do it personally? I don't think it's fair to associate it to psychopath/sociopath etc, that doesn't match his character because he's made several decisions (mainly leaning on the clone wars cartoon) that go against him being that way. I think he does it so no one else has too.

2) Anakin didn’t need any weapon to kill the Emperor; the Death Star’s internal architecture sufficed. Guess who decided to build the superweapon in the first place?

3) Sidious didn’t see Vader’s turn coming because he was preoccupied with Luke Skywalker. Luke was the fruit of the forbidden romance Sidious had encouraged between Anakin and Padmé in hopes of turning Anakin to the Dark Side. 

4) The Emperor was aboard the Death Star because he was using himself as bait to lure the Rebel fleet to Endor.

5) Sidious’ last act was to shamelessly renege on the promise he’d made to lure Anakin to the Dark Side: the ability to save his loved ones from dying. So confident was he that Vader was Dark forever, that he never imagined that Anakin would come back to claim what was owed him.

VillainM,1618522448,mroou3,10,1,"For characters like Anakin, Obi-wan, Padmé, and Yoda, they’ve all been voiced by the same actors for years in many forms of media. 

For characters like Luke, Leia, and Han, Star Wars seems to just choose a new actor for almost every voice appearance. 

Using Leia as an example, she’s voiced by different actresses in Battlefront, Forces of Destiny, and Rebels. Anakin, who also appears in all three of those titles, is voiced by Matt Lanter all throughout. Luke is also voiced by different actors in Battlefront 2015, Battlefront 2017, and Forces of Destiny (Mark Hamill). Even Vader has three different canon voices between Rebels, Battlefront, and Fallen Order. 

All I can think is that the characters with recurring voice actors are primarily former members of the clone wars cast. It still seems really strange to me that for characters who didn’t appear in clone wars, Star Wars doesn’t seem to care about finding one actor to voice a character long term.

But anyways, it got me thinking about Empire and why I usually rank it so high so I sort of played it back through my head since I had watched it someone recently and honestly, the only thing that makes me like the movie as much as I do is Hoth and the end parts of Bespin (Luke fighting Vader, and the gang escaping). Asteroid Belt, Dagobah (sorry Yoda), and the beginning parts of Bespin really don't do much for me.

Maybe it's not that unusual that certain parts of a film really make the movie shine for some people.

It really didn't sit right with me, considering the fact that not a single Jedi, except for Yoda and Jaro Tapal, sensed the disturbance in the Force from the Jedi being killed off, which already made me skeptical, and then, when Ki-Adi-Mundi's Clone Troops turned against him, he was almost effortlessly gunned down, despite the fact that Jedi Masters on his level have been frequently shown to cut down hordes of Battle Droids while blocking their Blaster Bolts almost without effort.

Then, when Plo Koon is fired on by the Clone Pilots behind him, he makes no effort to evade, such as killing his ship's engines briefly to get behind them, like his survival instinct had completely vanished.

Noahrstimmy,1618444117,mr33tq,31,1,"Let’s start off by stating some facts before we get into this. There is no doubt the new Star Wars Disney movies are an embarrassment to all things holy in the Star Wars universe. I’m not even that die hard of a Star Wars guy but I truly feel for you loyalist cause those movies were utter nonsense. 
Now a statement needs to be made that may sound off but is true, the new Star Wars films are more like the ones of the past than the prequels. More adventure type of films, slow battles, entering a new story. It is important to note that the battles, and lightsaber duels specifically were so bad it felt like I was watching the old films from the 70’s, but at least those films had some emotional weight where I actually gave a fuck. 

Now onto the prequels...scratch that onto Revenge of the Sith. Don’t get me wrong, I hail the prequels, they had some classic moments. The pod race, the duel between Darth Maul and Obi Wan and Qui Gon Jinn, that duel was epic on another level and introduced lightsaber battles in a whole new way. However let’s be real the movie of all Star Wars movies is Revenge of the Sith. Usually in great movies you get maybe one or two 20 minute moments of awesome acting, cinematography, music, action and drama all in one scene. In ROTS you get the whole movie. Beginning seen when they look for grievous and you get your favorite duo together, which ends in a battle with COUNT DOOKU. Than they split off and have there own side quests, one fights another BOSS and anakin fights the BOSS OF BOSSES. Than we have the order 66 scene which honestly could be in top 5 scenes in all the movies in history of Star Wars. And from there we have high level, fate of the universe drama, oh I forgot to mention Yoda fighting a war on Kashyyyk. And that’s not even the best parts, than we have the duels of all duels that still haven’t even been touched by any other duels between Anakin and Obi Wan, plus a side duel between Yoda and Darth Sidious. It is the ultimate watch, ultimate everything. The old movies were boring, good story, but ultimately very boring.

Prof_Tickles,1618432416,mqze2g,2,1,"In order to really drive home how this works out in the long run I have to take this back to the beginning so bear with me. I’m going to use what Freddie Prinze jr said on a podcast a while back then build off of it so it ties into my final point. 

When Palpatine perverted the force to an unfathomable degree the force finally decided that the Sith were no longer a manageable nuisance and needed to be dealt with. 

The force creates a “chosen one,” to be borne by Shmi Skywalker. Years later the hope of the universe is discovered by the Jedi then trained. 

Palpatine, being the cunning strategist he is knows he cannot kill Anakin otherwise the force will retaliate with something even greater. Something he truly cannot conquer. So what does Sheev do? He seduces Anakin. Throwing a wrench in the Force’s grand plan. Or so he thinks. Unbeknownst to him Anakin is still the chosen one, regardless of the plot twist.

So the force, upon seeing that there’s now TWO Sith, creates twins Luke &amp; Leia.

But Luke/Leia are babies they cannot help Anakin, nor can they effect him in the way he needs to be effected so what does the force for the time being until they grow up? It clears the path.

Jedi like Ashoka, Cal Kestis, Kanan, Ezra etc have a critical role. Their job is to eliminate roadblocks. Inquisitors, assassins, what have you. So by the time Luke is old enough it’s just him and Vader. Nobody to get in between a critical confrontation. Because Luke offers Vader the one thing he needs, the thing he turned to the dark side over. The only thing that can bring Anakin back to fulfill his destiny: FAMILY. 

Should Luke fail, then Leia is the backup plan.


Fast Forward years later.

Somehow Palpatine does it again, he flies in the face of god. He cheated when he shouldn’t have been able to.

But the force is smart. The force KNOWS Palpatine and his personality. Palpatine’s ego won’t allow him to accept defeat so out of spite he corrupts the descendant of the person who defeated him. Take that Force! Win for the Sith...or so he thinks. 

The force has a plan. This time it’s salty so it’s going to do a little spiting of it’s own. It’s going to create a dyad between Ben and not just any random girl, oh no the force wants to add insult to injury. So it makes the second half of the dyad Rey. The forgotten heir of Palpatine.

But there’s still a problem. 2 Dark siders/1 Jedi.

In order for this plan to work there needs to be two Jedi. So it sets a chain of events into motion, with the end goal of bringing Ben Solo back to the light. In order to do this a few people need to clear the roadblocks once again. 

Han needs to help. To show his son that hope is not lost. Luke needs to apologize, to remind him that hope isn’t lost in him, and Leia needs to do the same. 

That way the big player, Rey can be the final seed. Because Rey offers Ben the thing he needs most. Hope and for someone to like him for who he is. Not just view him as a legacy as Han/Leia &amp; Luke did. 

It works. The dyad unifies, and defeats Palpatine.

BUT the force being all knowing had a third option. A backup plan had Ben chose to remain loyal to the dark side. Then kill Palpatine, or choose to work with Palpatine.

I really never understood the trench death star issue. Almost every machine in existence has a weakness, your car has a gas tank that can explode, airplanes, simple mechanical machinery, if you know how the machine works (have their diagrams/plans) you can figure out how to destroy it or disable it. 

While I loved Rogue One, I didn't see the necessity in creating a weakness for the death star. Like I said, machines have weaknesses, it's almost inevitable.. you just have to find them. I imagine rebel engineers had to pour over the death star plans and diagrams and figure out if there were indeed weaknesses and how to possibly exploit them. 

For example, you can stick a potato in some ones car exhaust pipe and fuck it up pretty badly. You could put a rag in the gas tank and light it on fire. Even tanks in warfare have weaknesses if some one gets close enough to it with a sticky grenade or can get a small bomb inside the tank.

You could think of the trench as some sort of exhaust port or something that eventually leads to a giant fuel source, it wasn't exactly an easy weakness to find and exploit and the torpedoes needed to be fired PERFECTLY so as to make it all the way to the center of the death star and reach the fuel source. As they explained in the movie, this just wasn't expected by the Empire, they didn't even realize the weakness was there or that a small one man fighter could even be a threat.

Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is full of plot holes but of all of them, this one makes the least sense to me. I just don't see the death star having a weakness as an issue, at least in ANH.

PostmodernPericles,1618403103,mqpggh,39,1,"In Clone Wars legends and current canon, it has consistently written that Mace blamed himself / felt responsibility for the entire clone war itself as he failed to strike down Dooku immediately when the whole “This party is over.” shenanigans on Geonosis happened. It makes perfect sense he’d ALSO guilt himself over not having struck down palatine when he had the chance instead of even addressing dumbass 22 year old anakin’s whiny winging about standing trial. 

I’m literally not going to argue why a hero character, one of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy no less, in franchise notorious for bringing back characters who supposedly fell to their deaths, would survive a fall such that he did. Especially after all the cirque de solei in flying traffic Anakin and Obi Wan willingly did in the previous movie. 

There’s also no reason why he wouldnt cut himself off from the force (as Luke later did) and go into hiding on, let’s say Nar Shadda, where he develops his Vaapaad fighting style by moonlighting /disguised as a Ubese master swordsman (wearing the sith stalker force unleashed outfit, which is actually based on boushh [@me if I’m
wrong]) in the Haxion Brood’s blood tournament (from Jedi fallen order). His aim could be to seize control of the criminal underworld to put it against the empire (perhaps this takes place around the time of solo where there is no organized rebellion of yet and luke skywalker is like... 10 years old.) 

While there on Nar Shadda he could also have met and began protecting the Baby Grogu - whom Huyang (clone wars canon) saved from the Jedi temple a decade prior. Maybe this newfound guardianship helps Mace slowly reconnect with the force. This development might also mean Mace is discovered by Xizor (a character notorious for knowing everything about his enemies).((also, see how this could be an entire spin off series? They could call if “the swordsman” who cares ?))

Perhaps Xizor tips off Vader of Mace’s whereabouts because he hopes they will destroy each other - or more likely , as Mace will kill Vader, whom he hates. Win, win, win for Xizor.

That being said, right as Mace is about to end Vader after an epic ass Nar Shadda rooftop fight  (because he is literally the only Jedi, save Yoda, strong enough in the force to defeat him at this point in time - remember ole Obi-wan is a charming mildly above average but experienced  Everyman Jedi) bringing his purple blade and/or the dark saber (cuz why not, we can figure it out - it’s fucking Star Wars, it’s not yet written who owned it at this time - maybe he beats Bo Katan for it) a mandalorian shows up behind him in the holiday special armor (cuz it looks dope af / gorgeously unique and fitting of the time) A shot is fired from the famous phase blaster (same as din djarin has), right through the back of Mace. It’s slowly disintegrating Mace but he feels no pain, the shot is in slow mo - Mace turns to face his assailant. The audience sees the helmet removed and its BOBA FETT - he looks Mace in the eye and says “At last, I’ve revealed myself to the Jedi... (Mace disintegrates completely) at last, i have my revenge).” Music swells, slappin chords of the Boba Fett theme, then suddenly - 

A distorted , exasperated voice from the out of focus “you’ll not be ::hhohh:: collecting a bounty ::prrrr:: this time, Fett.” Boba has raised his eyebrow and turns to Vader as he becomes the focus - his damaged cyborg body rested upright against the wall and his helmet fractured. We hear one last puff from his respirator as he stands up and raises his gloved hand, pointing sternly at Fett. “NO... DISINTEGRATIONS!!!” Immediate cut to stars and credits as fanfare starts.

Mine is a bit unconventional. As a kid, I would only get to play the demo version of a game. I'd play two games in particular that I really liked. One had a guy with a white shirt and a green laser sword that could use ""Force Powers"". The other one was a sequel, featuring the same guy but this time all in black and with an Orange Lightsaber. ""Imperial Troops have entered the base"" said a bunch of soldiers with weird helmets and blue shirts. Then, I'd kill a bunch of troopers in white armor. A year later I happened to have gotten a game from Lucasarts called Full Throttle. The CD had a demo of another game called ""Dark Forces"" and I once visited their website on my 56Kbps internet. There, I saw this amazing image of the same guy from the previous games, but with improved graphics. This time he had a blue Lightsaber. I was in shock. It looked great! I had to have that game, so I gathered money for a year and bought it when I was 11. The game was [Jedi Outcast](https://youtu.be/Ojh20tGNWJU) and I would play it all the time. On the level where I got my Lightsaber back, I was amazed by the soundtrack, Binary Sunset and The Force Theme started playing - I didn't know their names back then - and that instantly took me to the realm of Classical Music.  


Then one day I occasionally turned on the TV and there was this insufferable guy inside a ship having a ""romantic"" scene with some big mouthed woman with braided hair saying something like ""there aren't enough scoundrels in your life"" and I just turned off the TV thinking that movie was some annoying garbage.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/jedipadawantrey/status/1381762083914706947?s=19) has been making the rounds for the past day or so and has been negatively received due to its implication that self proclaimed SW fans who dont know smaller details in SW aren't real fans.i believe that's wrong. There isn't a test out there that you need to pass to be accepted as a real fan but there is some truth to it as he mentions characters like Rey, Ben, and Grogu.

There are nine main characters in Star Wars' OT. And whether it's a retcon or not, every ""new"" character mentioned in the tweet is *directly* related to at least one of those nine. Kylo is a Skywalker/Solo(/Organa?) and Rey is a Palpatine. And up until Ahsoka was introduced into the story of the Mandalorian, we all called Grogu Baby Yoda.

So while I dont think ""real"" star wars fans exist because they know the info in every nook and cranny in the galaxy, I do think these characters should have been truly new and not descendants of existing ones. It makes gatekeeping easy and forces the new fan to watch all the old stuff if they dont feel accepted when we should just make new stuff. I mean could you imagine if Grogu looked like a baby version of a much less popular jedi with less distinguishing features and less screen time?(Ki-adi, Coleman Trebor) And having to force Mandorian fans to watch the old stuff just to get the reference which is now more of an inside joke? 

Alright rant over but all I'm saying is that what his tweet tells me is that ~~world~~ galaxy building doesnt work and it makes the SW universe seem like a small town when you do it like that. Making everyone related and throwing the same nine characters into every story is alienating more people than its uniting.

TL;DR: gatekeeping bad but easy to do when ""new"" stories involve several descendants of old characters. Stop fanservice and create new stories",StarWars,The guy who made the tweet about Revan and new SW fans knowledge of the old stuff is *kind of* right.

JosefSchnitzle,1618002858,mnquht,0,1,"Hey guys, so I've read a handful of the star wars novels, and was looking for any recommendations of what to get next. Also with the range of different authors out there doing EU content, I was wondering if anybody had opinions on which authors tended to produce the better books.

I've read 6 books so far, 3 of which were by James Luceno (Darth Plagueis, Labyrinth of evil, and the rise of Darth Vader). I thought these novels were great and would highly recommend all of them, but the first two in particular were done very well.

Then there is 'outbound flight' by Timothy Zahn, and 'the approaching storm' by Alan Dean Forster. Again, I would recommend both these books as they were very interesting reads. I wouldn't rate either as highly as the James Luceno books, however, I have heard good things about both authors and would be more than willing to buy more of their books, if any were recommended.

Finally was 'revenge of the sith', by Matthew Stover. I was initially not expecting much due to the fact that it's a movie novelisation, but it actually ended up being my favourite book. Fantastically written. It adds a lot of depth that wasn't captured in the movie, and I couldn't recommend it enough to any prequel fans. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that Matthew Stover has done much else in the way of star wars novels.

So if anybody would recommend any further novels or specific authors I would appreciate the insight. I'm not as interested in content surrounding the sequel era, though would happily give anything a chance if it comes highly recommended.

I wanted to get the Darth Vader series so I started by looking on eBay and found some there. I also stopped at local comic books shops and picked some up there. I was working out of town this week and stopped in a couple comic book stores between meetings and tried to finish up some of the gaps in the DV series.

I have loved *Solo* since the first time I saw it. It's fun, it's fast-paced, it basically checks of all the boxes I wanted a Han Solo movie to check off - meeting Chewbacca, meeting Lando, winning the Millennium Falcon in a Sabacc game (which, by the way, I loved the little twist of the winning game not happening right away), making the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs (well, if you round down, anyway) - it introduced some great new characters, it featured a cameo from a beloved old villain, it showed that not every Star Wars movie needs to feature a crisis of galactic proportions involving some combination of space wizards, gargantuan battle stations, and enormous armies... I could go on and on, but I think you get my point.

If anything, I think that the one flaw with the movie was not anything about the movie itself, but rather its release date. Having it come out so soon after TLJ and its polarized reaction (to put it generously) really hurt it, especially given all the drama involving the movie's directors. If *Solo*'s release date had been delayed to Christmas 2018, there would have been more time for Ron Howard to polish the movie, and it could have been given a proper marketing push instead of the rushed job it ended up receiving. Having a new Star Wars movie every Christmas was really fun while it lasted, and I think we'd still be getting that (well, the current state of movie theaters notwithstanding) had *Solo* been given a bit more breathing room. Instead, it really felt like Lucasfilm hit the brakes really hard with their plans for Star Wars movies after *Solo* basically tanked at the box office.",StarWars,Thoughts on Solo,1868,337,5.543026706231454

Also unrelated to my title but &gt;!in the first “season” of the show, when Yoda and Padme went to Ilum!&lt; Padme had on an all white outfit with a hood, which reminded me of one of my favorite KOTOR 2 characters, the Handmaiden! Then I realized they are both voiced by Grey DeLisle. 

Basically this post is just me gushing about discovering something completely new for me to love about Star Wars. I personally wasn’t a huge fan of Episodes I or II, and I tried and failed to get into the Sequels, but gave them a fair chance. 

Despite that, I feel like Star Wars is at a real turning point since the Disney deal and I am really encouraged by what I’m seeing, such as adding CW 2003 to Disney+ and remastering artwork of several beloved legends books like Bane, Heir to the Empire, etc... I think no matter who you are, how old you are, or what Star Wars media is your favorite, we’ve all got some great stuff to look forward to in the *hopefully* near future.

I recently got into reading some Star Wars books recently, as much as I hate reading. I pushed through and read *Darth Plagueis* and *The Dark Lord Trilogy* and man were they good. I don't like reading usually, but the quality of the content blew me away. I have been reading the original Thrawn trilogy lately and I am honestly in love with it. It is a near-perfect sequel trilogy. You get to see Han, Luke, Leia and Chewbacca go at it in the aftermath of the OT with a A-class villain. Timothy Zahn somehow is able to write the OT characters as if you were watching the OT movies. These books feel like a natural continuation of the OT. I am on the final volume of the trilogy and it truly has been a cinematic experience.

This isn't a sequel hate post nor is it endorsing hate to the sequels. To anyone who hates the sequel trilogy, you can check out the original Thrawn trilogy.

[https://unwhitewashthebadbatch.carrd.co/](https://unwhitewashthebadbatch.carrd.co/)

An excerpt from the about page:

“Whitewashing is when a creator takes a character of color and changes their features, skin, hair, or other details about them to make them appear more white/less like their racial/ethnic identity. “

“Every clone trooper is a clone of Jango Fett, who is played by a Māori man named Temuera Morrison. The Bad Batch is a group of genetically altered clone troopers who have ""desirable mutations"" that make them physically different from ""regs"" (a derogatory word for regular, unaltered clones). These clones are smarter, fight harder, are more independent, and are white. This happened to every single member of The Bad Batch. Whitewashing is racist. Genetic superiority tied to skin color or ability is racist (and ableist). The Bad Batch is racist.”

I'd like to think that, similarly to the events surrounding Paramount's Sonic film, the Star Wars community could try and make this more well known. And I'd like to think the fandom located here would be willing to help make that possible.

For me it’s so out of character it would pretty much be the equivalent of the new Batman’s character, infamous for not killing anyone, suddenly killing Robin.

I know this isn’t a perfect example because there are some earlier iterations of Batman where he killed people, but just pick any protagonist, and them suddenly acting against their core trait, making them a completely different character.

BingusBongusBangus69,1617919612,mn2sad,3,1,"I bought Republic Commando the other night on Playstation, and it was a pretty fun experience. I had been waiting for nearly years to find Republic Commando somewhere, ever since I saw the trailer for it in the extras section of the OG Battlefront. I don't think it's quite as good as a lot of people say it is, I was honestly starting to get a little disappointed a short way into the second section of the game. But I still thought that on the whole, it's a solid piece of work that is a blast to play. 

So now onto the reason I'm writing this post: I'd love to see Republic Commando remade with today's technology, with Dee Bradly Baker AND Temura Morrison on voice acting. Keep Temura on 38, but replace the other three Deltas with Dee. The reason being, I didn't like the voices for the other three Commandos because they didn't feel like clones, they just felt like normal human troopers outfitted with Katarn armor. No one else could play 38 as well as Temura, and Dee is exceptionally gifted with giving individual troopers their own personality through their voice. He exhibits this exceptionally well in the characters of Captain Rex and Commander Cody: while Rex is still a very serious and very strict clone, he's much more casual than Cody and when he speaks it's a lot more relaxed than Cody. Cody on the other hand, always speaks with an official and formal tone of voice, and is much more strict about regulation than Rex. When you listen to them side by side, even though they have the same voice, you know whose voice is whose. That would be perfect for the Deltas, and Dee would absolutely be able to keep their personalities intact while also restoring the idea that they're clones, not truly individuals. 

Another thing I'd add is the ability to assign certain clones to certain maneuvers, and make it so that they're best in their specialty maneuvers and just okay in others. For example, Sev is the sniper and sharpshooter of the team. Give Sev 100% accuracy in sniping positions, and give the others 70-80% accuracy in those same positions. Scorch is the demolitions expert, so make it so that when he sets a demo charge it only takes ten seconds, but when the others do it make it take 20-25 seconds. Essentially what I'm saying is make it matter which Commando I put in which firing position or assign to blow up the wall blocking our path. This way, their specialties mean something and aren't flavor text. 

And finally, the main reason why I would love this remake, is make it so that instead of dozens of loading screens that don't tell me if I finished a section or if the level ended, create cut scenes that either begin or finish the levels so that I know when I'm starting a new level in the mission or if I only finished a section. Or, remove the sections entirely and create smooth transitions from one section to the next instead of jarringly being dumped into and out of loading screens when the sets need to change. 

Final note: having more weapons to pick up would be nice too, I didn't like any of the weapons I was able to pick up from enemies and I never used them except when I could avoid using the garbage DC-15S, which I would also like to have overhauled.",StarWars,Hear me out here: Star Wars Republic Commando reboot/remake,3206,583,5.499142367066895

Lucas continued to add things almost for spite, but now he's not even in control of the series anymore. Disney can do whatever they want with it, and what do they do? *Maclunkey.*

Meanwhile, Warner Bros. was more than willing to spend $50 million on a re-edit for their panned flop for no other purpose than to please fan outcry after just a couple years. Now Snyder fans are really happy! I've mocked them in the past but they got what they wanted, and they're satisfied. I'm more than happy for them.

There is nothing stopping Disney from doing the same thing with Star Wars. Actually even less is stopping them. They don't even have to DO anything! Just touch up on the visuals a little bit, and boom, you've got yourself the original Star Wars trilogy. It will hardly cost them anything, and it's basically a guaranteed success. If WB can satisfy fans with the original vision of a hack director, why can't Disney?

VenousMallard46,1617914494,mn10b0,8,1,"So I was thinking about Princess Leia and some weird things came up in regards to her story that I haven’t been able to explain.

First: why is she called a princess? Was Bail the king/prince of Alderaan? Or was it her adopted mother? If it was the former, weird that it was never brought up, but if it was the latter, that brings up even more questions.

Luke asks Leia in return of the Jedi “what do you know about your mother”, and Leia replies something like “not much, but I remember she was sad.” We’re led to believe this is Luke’s mother as well, this is padme. Now, obviously that doesn’t make any sense, considering Leia was a newborn the only time she saw her mother. However, that also means that Leia either doesn’t consider her adoptive mother her “real mother”, which would be weird, or that she didn’t have an adoptive mother at all, meaning that either she always knew she was not really an organa or that the “queen” of Alderaan died when Leia was very young, and that’s who Leia was referring to. Which would be even more weird. 

Another one I had is why no one refers to Leia as the queen of Alderaan after Alderaan destruction. Presumably, leias parent or parents, the alderaanian monarch, died when it was destroyed. So wouldn’t that make Leia the new queen? 

Or, and this is even more crazy: does everyone consider Leia a princess because her mother, her actual mother, was a queen at one point in her life? Does everyone know, including Leia, that leias mom is padme? Do they know the father? 

My last question is, it seems kinda weird that Leia never brings up Alderaan again, considering that presumably all her family and friends lived there and her life was lived there and it was all obliterated.

I dislike a few animated episodes here and there but I love the OT, the prequels, RO, Solo, TFA, TLJ, CW, Rebels, and the Mandalorian. I disliked some of the newer entries when I first saw them but quickly grew to enjoy them and saw how each one contributed to the overarching story of SW. 

The only exception is TROS. After more than a year since its release and despite repeated viewings and even after studying background info in sources like the Visual Dictionary, Episode 9 still feels like a disappointing and jarring departure from the rest of the story. It feels like a feature-length retcon of the saga and constantly reminds me that the ST had no preconceived plan or arc, even though it was meant to conclude a single cohesive story.

Still, I want to like this movie, and I know there are people out there who enjoy it. Is there a Star Wars apologist out there who can help me let go of my hate?

Now I don’t believe this justifies his actions but it makes sense. The Jedi Council constantly belittled Anakin, not seeing him as one of their own. They wouldn’t save his mother’s life nor would they let him do it either, because her life was insignificant to them and not important. Anakin tried to become a master so he could have the “rank” to do so himself but wouldn’t grant him permission to do so. They held him back from his training and treated him like a joke. They only were concerned with politics and adhering to the senate. Anakin believed Palpatine was the only person who tried to help him save his wife after his trusted “friends” and “comrades” wouldn’t. Anakin shouldn’t have gave in to the dark side regardless but his constant rejection, fear and lack of help from the Jedi is what drove him to fall. Obi-wan was his best friend and older brother figure and not even he stood up for Anakin when he needed him. If it wasn’t for Anakins turn to the dark side who knows how different things could have been especially for Luke’s story as well.

I don't like film, or really anything the sequel trilogy stands for but that's a debate for another time. My little amounts of praise for the films include a few small scenes and the characters of Ben Solo &amp; Finn, I do enjoy a few of the duels and this is one of them. It is just a simple duel which I enjoy, I don't feel much emotion when watching it but its entertaining and I like it. The rain makes it feel like a spectacle and there aren't really any complaints with it except them starting to pull lightsabers, which was rather iffy but aside from that, it's a good duel. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Darth Vader vs. Obi Wan Kenobi (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope).**

https://preview.redd.it/6c2t04lsbvr61.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55bb740df97151eb5d4d75d46465c47f66c5c3b0

The first duel in Star Wars, though there wasn't really much action in it, it's more the emotion in it which makes it great. Obi Wan confronting his old student and then sacrificing himself in honor of his new hope Luke Skywalker, really a great introduction to lightsaber dueling.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Finn vs. Kylo Ren (Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens).**

Again I don't like the sequels but that's aside the point. All in all I like this duel because it's one of those simple duels that never becomes boring. Also Kylo &amp; Finn are the only characters from the trilogy that I like and it's an interesting concept seeing a non force sensitive character battle a Sith with a lightsaber with the 2 of them just trying to overpower each other. It's really short this one part of the final duel but still ok.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Count Dooku vs. Anakin Skywalker &amp; Obi Wan Kenobi (Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith).**

https://preview.redd.it/v4y3c1dfcvr61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd186aef0d8df403e64b18d4946ee8e14e5db40f

Dooku vs the 2 Jedi he bested in the end duel of Episode II is a pretty good opening fight for the finale of the Prequels. While the one in Episode II was not good this one improves in everyway, the choreography is on point and there is emotion in it and shows how much Anakin has improved with the lightsaber. And we get to see Anakin getting a big dose of the darkside when he beheads Dooku the man who cut off his arm but like...the best thing to come of this duel is no doubt....*""Dew it"".*

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader (Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back).**

No words besides *""I am your father""* and the duel is great. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker (Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi).**

A great follow up to the dual from Empire Strikes Back, so much emotion behind it, its fun to watch and it goes along with the Endor battle perfectly. It also conveys Luke starting to struggle with the Dark Side in a very convincing way, but then ends with him swearing his allegiance to the Jedi, great duel.  

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Qui Gon Jinn &amp; Obi Wan Kenobi vs Darth Maul (Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace).**

*Processing img aq52q38obvr61...*

Now I didn't experience this back in '99 because I wasn't born yet but I still love seeing it, this is the first film in the films where we get to see the old Jedi v Sith talked about in the OT going at it (if you dont count the one on tatooine). But it also has an emotional ending and an ambiguous fate for the villain. Also seeing the dual bladed lightsaber is an absolute treat.

This is literally a perfect lightsaber duel for me, fact paced action, force abilities, emotion, its an absolute spectacle, there is no shortage of action, I actually like the fact that its long because that's what we I expect from the most anticipated duel in the entire saga. Some people have deemed this one horrible because of the over the top action with them on the lava but honestly that's the kinda stuff I want in my duels. Honestly I couldn't care if its a bit long because its still really good and never stops being fun to watch.

rickychicky01010101,1617843656,mmgguk,3,1,"I have tried to make a road map for the upcoming Star Wars shows on Disney+, and Rogue Squadron. To do this I've collected the information we know, and made a couple of assumptions and figured out something that I think s at least close to what their release plan might be for the next few years. First I will list off a couple of my assumptions.

1. I assume ""The Bad Batch"" is 22 episodes. Kevin Keiner said on the Full of Sith Podcast that he had finished scoring episode 14. I first assumed we would get 12 episodes to match the last season of the Clone Wars, but him mentioning episode 14 makes me believe we will get a full 22 season.
2. I'm also assuming the first episode of ""The Bad Batch"" (being 70 minutes long) are three episodes put together. If each episode is around 22 minutes it makes sense that three is around 66 minutes (which is close to 70 minutes). This means that episode 2 airing May 7th is actually the fourth episode.
3. Between each show we will have one week off where we're getting a ""making of"" or a featurette or something like that. This assumption lines up with how Marvel does it, and I guess Disney would like the same for Star Wars. So I do think from May 4th this year we are getting something Star Wars (close to) every week.
4. No Star Wars show will overlap until at least 2023. This is just a hunch based on how many shows that are now in production. During or after 2023 I think they might have to let shows overlap, at least animation and live-action.
5. I'm guessing ""A Droid Story"" is coming out this year. It just makes sense, and it filled a gap in my rundown that I felt needed to be filled.
6. The Book of Boba Fett will be 4 episodes. This is just based on a rumor, but that is the closest thing I have to concrete information about how many episodes the show will be, so I'm using that number in this rundown.
7. I'm guessing the other Mado-related shows will be 8 episodes to fit with The Mandalorian.
8. Ewan McGregor said in an interview with ""Men’s Journal"" in 2019 that Obi-Wan Kenobi will be 6 episodes, so I'm using that number. I've heard other rumors that it's 4 episodes, but I'm trusting the man himself more than other rumors.
9. TFA, Rogue One, TLJ and TRoS was released on the third Friday of December in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019. Given that Patty Jenkins Rogue Squadron will be released in December of 2023 I'm assuming it will release the third Friday of that December as well, making its release date, December 15, 2023.

Alright! So here I will list off my assumed release dates for all episodes in the shows.

I remember reading a post a few months ago (not sure how old the post was when I found it), about someone noticing blaster sounds in the background of Return of the Jedi during the scene where Luke is trying to escape the Death Star with Vader and all the Stormtroopers and Imperial personnel are running around trying to evacuate. The post was asking what the blaster shots could have been, because they weren’t coming from ships in the space battle and there were no Rebels present on the Death Star other than Luke and the Imperials seemed to be ignoring him and Vader. OP was wondering who was doing the shooting and what they could have been shooting at. A commenter suggested their head canon was that the Imperials were shooting at each other, and that a civil war of sorts had broken out aboard the Death Star with Imperials desperately trying to escape and killing each other over shuttles and escape pods. There was also a YouTube clip of the scene linked (presumably by OP) where the blaster sounds in question could be heard. 

It was a very interesting read and I’m trying to uncover it again. I tried searching various key words I could think of, but couldn’t find it. I’m 99% sure the post was on Reddit, though it’s possible it could have been posted to a different sub.

I think it’s well overdue for a canonised remake/sequel.  The game could take a lot of inspiration from shooters that have released in years since the originals release. It could encapsulate the experience of being an elite operator and using stealth and espionage to your advantage as we’ve seen in the call of duty modern warfare series and also include the fun of being an absolute powerhouse such as in DOOM 2016.

Bobinti,1617809285,mm4mw3,15,1,"*This takes place as Rey is on Ahch-To, trying to convince Luke to train her.*

**Luke:** I sense a power in you, Rey. It’s strong. Too strong.

**Rey:** How can a power be too strong?

**Luke:** My father’s purpose was to bring balance to the force. That’s no ordinary Jedi. They don’t come in troves. Powerful Jedi like that are rare. Once in a thousand millennia rare. And yet here you are.

**Rey:** Anakin Skywalker.

**Luke:** Yes.

**Rey:** I’m to bring balance back to the force, like he did?

**Luke:** That’s what I fear. But it doesn’t make sense. He was the chosen one.

**Rey:** So there *is* unbalance. I felt it. So what’s causing it? What’s pulling the force to the dark?

*Luke looks at Rey.*

**Luke:** Ben.

**Rey:** But I’ve seen Ben. I’ve seen his mind. He doesn’t have that power. He’s not evil. He’s lost, like me. He needs someone to guide him.

**Luke:** Rey, I trained students for decades at the Academy. Not all of them were good. Many had darkness inside of them. But they were dealt with. They were trained, or exiled, or made to forget about their powers. Ben was the one student who I couldn’t help. He found his calling within Snoke - some force sensitive being who came from nowhere.

**Rey:** If the force is so strong, then maybe he didn’t come from nowhere. Maybe the force was never truly balanced.

**Luke:** Then my father would have failed.

**Rey:** Forgive me, Master Luke, but if you sense a power within me so strong, then maybe this isn’t your fight at all. Maybe you were never destined to help Ben. Maybe that task was never going to be possible. 

**Luke:** What are you saying?

**Rey:** If what you’re sensing is true, and I am to bring balance back to the force - to to deal with Ben Solo - to defeat Snoke - then I need to be trained by a Jedi. And you’re the only one left.

**Luke:** Rey-

**Rey:** It doesn’t have to be for the Jedi order. That’s not what matters now. We just need peace. Whether the galaxy needs Luke Skywalker is irrelevant - *I* need him. And so does Ben.

*Luke shakes his head in disbelief. There is a pause.*

**Obi-Wan:** She’s right.

*They both turn to look at Obi-Wan, who has appeared as a Force Ghost.*

**Luke:** Ben-

**Obi-Wan:** I trained your father, Luke. He was seduced by the dark side of the force. I blamed myself for years. It wasn’t until I became one with the force that I truly understood that it wasn’t my fight at all. It was your father’s. I was simply his Master. Luke, you are the Master now. And Rey (*He turns to her*) - don’t you think for one second that Luke is the last Jedi.

**Luke:** But what about my father? What about the prophecy of The Chosen One?

**Obi-Wan:** Anakin’s balance still rests. It’s under threat, of course, as it always shall be - but it’s not gone. It is the duty of the Jedi Guardians to preserve Anakin’s balance now.

*Luke looks at Rey. Obi-Wan notices.*

**Obi-Wan:** Ah (*He chuckles*), now you understand. Then my work here is done.

A lot of fans went nuts with Ahsoka's line in a season trailer for Rebels, and celebrated the arrival of the *Sphyrna*\-class corvette, which was a clear nod to the *Hammerhead*\-class cruiser that appeared in the fan favorite KOTOR and SWTOR games. What they probably don't know, however, is that Lucasfilm didn't stop there. Since then, some writers have went absolutely crazy (in a good way) with canonizing old Legends concepts. Some were more like analogues, others were direct ""lore ports"" from Legends.

These analogues/""ports"" include Naga Sadow, Uliq Qel Droma, Revan, Empress Teta, Ooroo, Jaster Mereel (along with Jango Fett's backstory of being a real Mandalorian warrior), Durge, and even Kyle Katarn. Most of these characters I would've never guessed would have made a return to canon, but once freaking Kyle Katarn was made canon (albeit through a canonically-ambiguous card game), I knew the Pandora's Box was open. Obviously a lot of their stories had to be tweaked or completely rewritten to fit into the new canon timeline, but it still has me excited for who else we could see.

I'd personally want to see a return of Rahm Kota, one of my absolutely favorite characters in the universe next to Canderous Ordo and Hondo Ohnaka. Obviously Galen Marek/Starkiller's story was so whacky that it barely even fit into Legends, meaning we'd unfortunately have to wipe that part of Rahm's story, but his entire backstory prior to meeting Starkiller could absolutely fit into new canon, and he could still be made to play a role in the formation of the Rebel Alliance.

I have been thinking about my rank list of Star Wars Episode Movies and I feel like I went with the crowd for the most part on liking the first two Star Wars Movies, I come to the conclusion that while not bad movies, that Episode IV and Episode V are actually my least favorite movies in the Franchise.

My rank list is;

1st- Return of the Jedi

2nd- Revenge of the Sith

3rd- The Force Awaken

4th- The Last Jedi

5th- Attack of The Clones

6th/7th- The Rise of Skywalker

6th/7th- The Phantom Menance

8th- A New Hope

9th- The Empire Strikes Back

TRS and TPM are interchangeable because I didn't see Episode 1 growing up and The Rise of Skywalker felt like it needed to explain more clearly. Attack of the Clones what makes it below the Last Jedi is the fact that watching the movie entirely raises more questions than it answers, and some deleted scenes are what answer some of those questions.

And for quite a while, I always believed it was the reason that the Empire eventually switched to natural born recruits. Wouldn't the Clone armies be vulnerable to an epidemic?

The clones are all genetically identical--barring a few occasional defects--so, wouldn't that mean they have the exact same immune systems? Isn't one of the prime concerns of cloning in general, the lack of variability in immune systems?

In the case of natural birth--when a disease hits, some may die, and others may survive. 

But in the case of clones--if a virus is lethal for one of them, it's lethal to all of them! None may survive exposure, because all of their immune systems are the same! One pathogen that can a clone's immune system can't resist, than none of them can!

Claim_to_Lame,1617750704,mloit3,2,1,"Disney+ has added some of the Ewok TV material. Back in the day when I was a kid ROTJ was a film we all needed to wait years to see after Empire stet the bar so impossibility high, and ep6 had a lot to offer, but boy did folks hate the Ewoks. The JarJar hate has been the only thing to eventually take the sting out of these furry marketing missteps years later. So it was hard even for a kid to give a cartoon about them a chance. Droid I remember watching hoping it would get better, but when you're starving for more content, you take what you can get. But I also watched Ewoks as a jagged pill to try and get more star wars fix, but it I was so biased as a fan, it was hard to enjoy for what it was.

I've been watching it now again with my kids, and I have to say, I was far too hard on it. The animation is great for the time, and voice actors all come from other classic Canadian cartoon projects like The Raccoons. The most surprising thing is the writing. Paul Dini has been the writer for all the episodes I've seen again so far, and despite the demographic, he crafted unique stories and characters.

And if she told the Order about what she foresaw, would they do anything, and what could the outcome be if they did? It's a shame she's too young to attend the battle, though.

The most obvious possibility I see is capturing/killing Grievous way earlier, maybe get some information about Dooku's motives. But how would it affect the relationship between the Jedi and Opress &amp; Ventress, if at all? Future connotations would also obviously include a lot less hostility from Merrin towards Cal Kestis, which might possibly include finding the Astrium significantly earlier, and that could even lead to safely obtaining the Bogano holocron long before the Empire discovers the planet, meaning the holocron never gets stolen.

Anakin was flawed, but he was also good. Like all of us, I have my inner demons as Anakin did. But I'm also compassionate, caring, a good friend, son, etc. Anakin was all those things as well. I just feel bad for Anakin because he was obviously emotionally vulnerable and the Jedi Order just told him to shut those feelings out. We know that won't work. Shutting those feelings leads to a massive build up of such feelings. One day it'll explode, and that's what happened to Anakin. It also doesn't help to have someone you trust with your life end up manipulating you and basically making you his slave to serve his interests and aspirations either lol.

The prequels trilogy which is created by George Lucas  explains the origin of Anakin becoming  Darth vader and the rise of the empire ,It is unique because of its storytelling including the villain like Darth sidious and it even led to spinoffs related to the prequel trilogy that takes place in the clone wars like the clone wars animated series.However, the prequel trilogy is known for its flaws such as Jar-Jar binks ,the characteristic behavior of anakin skywalker in episode 1-3,too much political overtones,the midi-chlorian part  and poor CGI effects in episode 1 

&amp;#x200B;

The sequel trilogy under Disney spearheaded by Kathleen Kennedy and directed by JJ Abrams and  Rian Johnson is the continuation of the saga where it involves new characters battling against a new enemy called the new order  ,It is known for its unique storytelling like its predecessors  with better special effects and even  a cool villain like  Kylo ren .However, the sequel trilogy is known for its flaws it copies the storyline of the original trilogy,ruins what makes the original trilogy special,some of the plot lines in the sequel trilogy remain unresolved,some think that the protagonist Rey is a Mary sue and the production team didn't come up with the plot of the sequel trilogy from start to finish from the very beginning which is why Disney decided to move on from the sequel trilogy and focus on the high republic billions of years before the prequel trilogy.

1. TROS

2. Rogue One

3. ANH

4. ESB

5. AOTC

6. ROTS

7. ROTJ

This sacrifices the sequels from being about their own characters and stories to basically an action packed opening to the other films. It adds more tension because the audience will presume Palpatine is a bigger threat knowing he had survived. People experience the redemption in episode 6 knowing what ultimately happens and thus the importance becomes less about their legacy on the galaxy and more of a story about a father and son. It also probably helps Luke’s arc remain more consistent with the character you see in the OT. Solo I left out as I feel like Han is not important enough to the story to have his own background movie, especially leaving out episode 7 and 8. Phantom menace is left out as per the original Machete Orders reasoning.

It is probably because of the marketing and slick and cool designs of these characters, as well as astounding performances from the actors, these two are made for the story to have someone to fill the shoes of minor leader (Hux) and minor obstacle (Phasma). I do think that because people were attached to these characters, they should've made them more prevalent after TFA (I like Hux in TLJ and TROS though).

I grew up with the PT and the OT and loved them both equally. Yet I’ve had friends, family, and online community laugh at me and put me down for enjoying the PT.

And now it seems the same thing is happening with the ST vs the EU and it just breaks my heart to see.

Yeah, I prefer the EU because it’s what I grew up with and spent a decade of my life exploring. And I understand many of the complaints the EU fans have towards the ST.

But I also believe that the ST fans have every right to enjoy the ST and I can honestly understand why they prefer it over the EU.

But I think many of us, including myself, have fallen into unhealthy habits and it’s time we make peace with each other in the community.

There have been major aggressors on both sides. Yes, it feels wrong that Disney and Kathleen Kennedy threw out the canon of the EU. It seemed really disrespectful. And on the other side we have Mark Hamill and George Lucas openly expressing their distaste for the way Disney has handled it. But I think it’s time to let this argument go and move forward.

So, to any ST fans out there, I want to apologize on behalf of the EU fans. The ST is just as valid as the EU.

And for any EU fans out there, I would like to ask that the ST fans please respect that we grew up with these EU stories that are heartbreaking to let go of. We just want to see the stories we love respected as well.

Maybe instead of fighting each other, we can merge these two universes together into a larger Star Wars Multiverse where both sides can be enjoyed by so many more people instead of alienating each other.

I realize this post is more for myself, to make peace with the current reality of Star Wars, than it is for anyone else. But maybe some others can find some peace in this post as well.

Tristanio97,1617539871,mjvgup,326,1,"The show is outstanding in terms of showing instead of telling and the animation is incredible.

Grievous in Rots while impressive only gets his moment in the spotlight very briefly and in the 3D clone wars show he becomes a bit of a “villain of the week” but still having his moments. My favourite quote of his from the 3D show is: “I do not care about your politics! I don't care about your, Republic! I only live to see you die!"" Grievous didn’t care about governing power or otherwise ruling the Galaxy, his sole purpose was to destroy the Jedi.

The 2D show turns Grievous into a legitimate horror movie villain creating shock whenever he appears from the initial appearance taking on the 5 stranded jedi and wiping the floor with them to the attack on Coruscant where Shaak Ti panics just by hearing his footsteps again. Then when he does appear after creeping into the scene he is a pure devastating force.

Fourth Entry: Star Wars Ep 3 Review

""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"": Star Wars

And it was a long time ago when Star Wars was a fantastic film. Until, that is, in the year 1999 George Lucas decided to bring forth the long-awaited prequel The Phantom Menance. Torn apart by critics and old-school fans alike, TPM was too much politics and not enough Star Wars. The combination of Lucas's non-abilty to write and direct and bad choices for actors led tho TPM's demise. The only redeaming factor was the most hard-core lightsaber battle to date between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jin, and Darth Maul. If it is one thing Lucas can do right, it is make awesome lightsaber battles.

However, the laughable plot and emotionless characters made TPM a real dissapointment. Due to Lucas's desire to make his movies mostly Computer Generated instead of the costumes and models that gave the original trilogy its realism, the movie just seemed, sadly, like just a movie. To me and many other fans alike, the original Trilogy seemed very real, very life-like and the actors' ability to perform their lines made A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi more like documentries instead of films.

George's 2nd attempt at ""revising"" the series came with the horribly named 2nd prequel film; Attack of the Clones. Not to be mistaken with fan's long awaited battle, The Clone Wars (something we have heard and waited for ever since hearing about it from Alec Guiesness in ANH), AOTC was much better than TPM, but that is not saying much. While Hayden played anger rather well, his other emotions made him seem very whiney and bratty. The relationship between Obi-Wan and Anikan (which you would guess would be a very close bond considering Obi-Wan being so saddened when talking bout Anikan to Luke in ANH), was nothing but a battle of wits. You could see that Obi-Wan and Anikan disliked, if not hated, one another. The love scenes between Anikan and Padme were decent in my opinion, and the acting was just as terrible as TPM. This film would have been much better if Lucas had a differnt director to get the actors into the film more, but alas, he did not. Again, Lucas went with Computer Graphics over costumes and this was very noticable during the lightsaber battles. The fighting against CGI beings was very sloppy. The actors just swung their weapons without looking at their enemies and when deflecting lasers, they just swung around (Unlike Luke in Return of Jedi when he actually made it look like he was swinging at the lasers instead of air).

Again, Lucas waited until the last 10 minutes of AOTC to give fans a reason to see the movie. The Yoda vs Dooku scene was bloody awesome. Though Dooku is no where near as intimidating or interesting as Darth Maul (my personal opinion is that Dooku should have died in Ep 1 and Maul should have stayed for 2 and 3).

Don't even get me started with showing how Boba Fett looks like without his helmet....*snarls*

Than, about a year after Clones came out, Lucas decided to release a Micro-Mini-Series (that translates into 5 minute long episodes) of the Clone Wars. The animation was laughable at best, the voice actors as dry and unbelievable as the real actors themselves, and only long enough for the fans to realize they hated it and turn off the TV, The Clone Wars is the biggest cop-out in Movie History. Instead of putting time, money, and actual effort into the biggest, most hard-core war in the Star Wars Saga, Lucas had these piss-poor animators give us a chibi-sized series. I mean, yes, it was neat seeing Anikan get bad-ass, but it wasn't enough. The sound was aweful and 3PO was turned into a homosexual instead of it just being an old joke. When he disrobed for Anikan to show off his new body and they played stripper music? WTF?

But on May 19th, my birthday, I gave George his very last chance with Episode 3, the Revenge of the Sith. The only reason I gave him the benifit of the doubt was because long time Star Wars fan and Ep 1 and 2 hater Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) gave it the thumbs up. Don't get me wrong, I would have seen it without his opinion, but trust me, it helped.

Revenge of the Sith was a beautifully made movie. Although the first 5 minutes were the slowest in Star Wars history (The sound and music didn't match the intense battle going on. It didn't drag you into the war), the fight between Anikan and Dooku was the most shocking fight in Star Wars history. George finally brought Anikan and Obi-Wan closer together and made their friendship more pronounced. Gone was Jar Jar (for those who didn't like him. I did) and the acting was much better. The main characters finally got into their roles (took them long enough) and the emotional shyt Anikan was going through was very belivable. I really sympathized with him. Palapitine was just as maniupulative and if you can believe it, even more sadistic than his previous appearences. Mace Windu was eh as usual. Always trying to be TOO bad-ass in my opinion during this movie. Yoda was animated even better and I honestly forgot he wasn't there at times. The final battle was bloody amazine and I wasn't dissapointed at all in this movie, which, comming from me, means a lot. However, this movie is still nothing compared to the original trilogy, but it is a close 2nd.

I give it 8 out of 10. ^.^

************************************************************************************************************
The Following contains huge spoilers. If you don't want to know certain scenes, stop reading now.










What I liked

Likes:
The Light Saber battles: More realitistic. Still sloppy when blocking lasers and attacking the driods, but the timing has improved 10 fold.

The Humor: Anikan, Obi, and R2-D2 were hilarious. There were many scenes (like in the elevator shaft when Obi-Wan wakes up dangling from Ani's leg) where I was laughing tears. I missed the light humor that was pronounced between Han, Leia, and Luke in the original trilogy

The Intesity: OMG! What Ani did to Dooku was the most hard-core scene EVER! And what he did to the kids, I had never though Vader to be that cruel. Plus the downfall of Anikan, when he is turning darkside just to save his wife, by the gods, the emotion was so rich and powerful, it was heart-wrentching. Vader started out doing this to save his wife and son but turned utterly evil in the process. Beautifully written George. Bout time!

The relationship: Ani and Obi-Wan were so much closer this time around. They were bickering but very brotherly, very father/son. I was very pleased.

The Ending: The fight of Yoda and Palpitine and Anikan and Obi-Wan was powerful. Obi-Wan's final speech to Anikan as Anikan is burning up was heartbreaking. The tears in his eyes looked real and you could feel his pain at this betrayal.



What I disliked:

The battles: Lucas should have made the Clone Wars movie. Because he didn't, we missed out on how bad-ass Grevious was and how cruel Dooku was. The Wookie War, the battle between Grevious was TOO SHORT! Not even 5 minutes. You see the wookies start the war and then BAM it is over. That was it! If he added another 30 minutes (yes it would be 3 hours but who cares!) and added to the battles, i would have been very happy.

Grevious: General Grevious. I have seen him fight in the Clone Wars cartoon and I was very excited for him to fight in this movie. He was very evil and was a genius. I loved when he tore open the window of his ship to escape into space. Very well done. However, he died in a 2 minute battle. It was kinda a cop-out. The big lightsaber battle I was looking forward too (since he fights with 4 sabers) was reduced to him cutting apart the floor before his hands got lopped off. It was sad. If you wanted to see Grevious battle, you had to see the cartoon which, George is you read this, IS A COP-OUT and George has cheated the fans horribly.

Mace Windu's death: Sam Jackson had in his contract to have one of the best deaths in the movie. While his death by Palpitine was nice, it wasn't as hard-core as I expected it to be. But damn did he suffer.

The Names: How the names Luke, Leia, and Vader came to be was horrific. Palpitine pulled the name Vader out of his ass and when Padme was giving birth it was like this:

while Padme is screaming and panting due to labor

""It is a boy. What shall he be called?""
AHH! Ahh! Luke!""
""It is a girl. What shall she be called?""
(Same as above. Replace Luke with Leia)

I would have liked to see Anikan and Padme talk over names. Just a bit to know why she chose the names, same with Palpitine. I don't like how these names were just pulled out of everyone's ass.

The Ending: Okay, so I said I liked the end. I also hated it. We have all scene the trailer where Vader rises on the platform in his suit. That was awesome. Hearing him breath for the first time was awesome, but when he found out Padme died and ripped himself off the table (looking like a black sci-fi version of Frankenstien) and screaming out ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"" while waving his arms dramatically...WHAT THE F*CK?! I couldn't believe that hard-core Vader, the man who destroyed his daughter's planet, who chopped off his son's hand, who slaughtered the entire Jedi Order, started his career like a little bitch screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. *sighs* That was horrible

With 2 already failed films, you’d expect to hold no hope for their sequel, yet some people consider episode 3 to be one of the greatest, if not THE greatest star wars film of all time. 

Rewatching this movie, I noticed it still follows many elements of the previous 2 films in it’s formula. It still uses a lot of CGI and green screen, arguably the most out of any of the films. It also still has some pretty terrible lines and acting from the cast though I think Ewan Mcgregor’s performance was at his strongest in this film. Honestly, the only saving grace of this movie, to me at least was it’s 3rd act. Having Yoda and Sidious with their own showdown was a brilliant choice by George Lucas, since it’s the first time you have 2 great actors actually act against each other. And I can admit the actors got a bit better with their acting ability after this film, I think Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman did improve, most likely because they tried to improvise more instead of being told what to do by Lucas.",StarWars,"Curious, why do many star wars fans rate episode 3 so highly amongst other star wars films?",1319,238,5.542016806722689

(ye I finished Rebels in 2-3 weeks)  


About Rebels and my questions:

 So as I said I just finished watching Rebels. I'm feeling kinda emotional rn I really liked the last 5 episodes and how Kanan sacrificed himself for the others and everyone was broken especially Ezra without his Master but yet he still found his way, I like the World between worlds episode too. The only 2 times I teared up in the series was when Ezra found out his parents were dead and in the epilogue when they told everyone's story after the OT especially how Zeb showed Kallus that he did not destroy the Lasat cuz Kallus probably felt bad after killing the Lasat but now he has a chance to redeem himself. And how Hera and Kanan had a child, so sad that Kanan cannot see his son and raise him. But my question is about Ezra, what happened to him? We see that Sabine only realized after few years she needs to rescue him. And what did Ahsoka do for so much time after Ezra saved her? She could have stopped Kanan from dying and helped the Crew back on Lothal. Are there any comics that connect to Rebels and answer my questions, and can any of you fill me in?   


What to do next:  
Idk what to do next cuz I watched all Star Wars content except: Vintage content, Resistance and Lego Stuff. I plan to do that one time but not now cuz I heard Resistance is bad + no force-sensitives(i don't like star wars content without force-wielders) and Lego and Vintage content are not Canon (i want to get all Canon content before i get into EU).

abdullah_lol,1617469531,mjckxi,12,1,"I know this has been done a lot before, but it is fun and I am pretty sure mine is the best one there will ever be. These are going to be mainly small changes and a sprinkle of larger ones. Please know the movie abbreviations, I will be using them a lot. In this post I will be only doing the TFA, and depending on how y'all like it, I will post the changes for the other two. Know that, unlike Disney, I have this whole thing planned out, and if something doesn't exactly make sense, I will most likely address it in a later date.

Ok first the TFA. This movie will have the fewest amount of changes, but it will be setting up the plot points in the next movies so it will feel like everything wasn't just being thrown in there last minute. First off, the First Order isn't going to be as big as it in the canon, I think it is far more realistic if the two sides are more evenly matched and it isn't a redo of the OT. Now, it will still be pretty goddamn ginormous, but they aren't the controlling force in the galaxy (yet). Everything will play along normally until the scene with Rey on Jakku. Ok, what I am going to do is simple, I will make Rey have the force, but like, from the beginning. She won't really understand it, she just knows its a power she has. And she will use it, when she is scavenging the fallen Star Destroyer she will be using the Force to look for some metal. She isn't going to be extremely powerful, just strong enough to use it with her in her every day life. I think this is believable, as kids having the force is normal until the Jedi Order takes them away, but since Jakku is nowhere, she wouldn't have been picked up by a Jedi. Then, when she sits down to have her food (before she meets BB8) she will see Kylo. Before I go on, I will be making her connection with Kylo a natural thing, not influenced by Snoke in any way. I think it is interesting having some mystery behind things, similar to the birth of Anakin Skywalker (until we find out later that some Squidward Sith was behind all of it). So, Rey and Kylo will see each other, it will be really brief. Kylo appears in front of her without any trace of traveling in the sand nor the Jakku sun upon him. And Rey will appear to Kylo sitting down in the middle of a hallway being strangely covered in a mystical desert glow. They will blink and check their eyes, then the next time they look, they will no longer be there. That is it, since they have no idea who the other person is, they will just assume they are hallucinating.

Then the story will go on until they meet Han and Chewy. First off, I'm removing the bit with Han and Chewie still being smugglers. They were war heroes for 30ish years, them having no change to themselves is makes no sense. Finn, Rey, Han and Chewie will be talking and Rey will passively force pull an apple to herself or something. Han will be mildly surprised and Rey will ask why. Han recognizes the force and knows what it is, but he doesn't really understand it. He will give his best shot of explaining the force to Rey but the explanation will be pretty awful. The story goes on until the First Order appear at Maz's palace place. There will only be some minor tweaks here but Kylo will use the force to locate Rey, who is in that jungle. Then, he will go completely berserk getting himself there. This will be my moment to show the Kylo is actually pretty strong. He will be doing flips with his saber, summoning lightning from the sky kinda like Thor, and maybe shooting fire out of his palms, I don't know. I want to have some new force powers. It gets kinda dull when the force can only do really specific things.

They story goes on until Kylo interrogates Rey. Kylo will look into her mind, then he goes deep trying to find the specific moment of her looking at the map to Skywalker. But then suddenly, he realises this isn't her mind anymore, it is his. Their connection is somehow reflecting their minds. And Kylo is looking back on his own memories. Maybe him being taught to handle a saber, Chewie teaching him to fly, or C3PO reading him a book or something. Then he will snap and stutter back. I think it is pretty stupid they Rey can reflect Kylo without any training, him being reflected by a mysterious power is much more believable. Then he will go to Snoke and ask him about it. Snoke will say, ""Even after countless millennia, no one *truly* knows anything about the force. Some say, it has a will. Mysterious things happen my young apprentice, such as the fabled birth, of Darth Vader (imperial march plays in the background). If what you say is true, then this girl may be dangerous to our cause. Bring her to me.""

The story continues until Kylo vs. Finn and Rey. I had the scene with Kylo being OP because I needed a scene with him being powerful, this won't exactly be that. First off, Kylo is going to do the same military tactic of punching himself to relieve his wound. But he will still suffer from it. Kylo will knock out Rey and battle Finn. Kylo does a twist-off a disarms Finn of the lightsaber, he brings his saber down, but this time, Finn jumps back and dodges it. Kylo knowing he is slow and wounded doesn't try to walk up and kill Finn, instead, he puts out a hand, and shoots out lightning. But this will be slow, less-powerful, torture focused lightning. Kylo yells ""TRAITOR"" as Finn is getting shocked. But then, the lightsaber will come out of the snow, interrupt the flow of lightning and come into Rey's hands, like in the original. Kylo and Rey will fight as they normally do, until the point where Rey chops up Kylo. I think it is silly knowing that an un-trained Rey can beat an experienced swordsman, handicapped or not. Instead, Rey takes two steps back, and channels all of her energy into her palms, and unleashes a powerful push with the force. Kylo is lifted off his feat and falls back, giving time for Rey to take Finn back to the Falcon, where they then assist the resistance in blowing up ~~the Death Star~~ Starkiller base. Rey will then go with Chewie and R2 to find the legend that is Luke Skywalker, war hero, beacon of hope, and Jedi grandmaster.

That concludes my changes to TFA. What we have done is establish the connection between Rey and Kylo, make Snoke sound smart, establish that Rey isn't a Mary Sue, and establish that Kylo is indeed a powerful foe.

abdullah_lol,1617469287,mjchrp,0,1,"I know this has been done a lot before, but it is fun and I am pretty sure mine is the best one there will ever be. These are going to be mainly small changes and a sprinkle of larger ones. Please know the movie abbreviations, I will be using them a lot. In this post I will be only doing the TFA, and depending on how y'all like it, I will post the changes for the other two. Know that, unlike Disney, I have this whole thing planned out, and if something doesn't exactly make sense, I will most likely address it in a later date.

Ok first the TFA. This movie will have the fewest amount of changes, but it will be setting up the plot points in the next movies so it will feel like everything wasn't just being thrown in there last minute. First off, the First Order isn't going to be as big as it in the canon, I think it is far more realistic if the two sides are more evenly matched and it isn't a redo of the OT. Now, it will still be pretty goddamn ginormous, but they aren't the controlling force in the galaxy (yet). Everything will play along normally until the scene with Rey on Jakku. Ok, what I am going to do is simple, I will make Rey have the force, but like, from the beginning. She won't really understand it, she just knows its a power she has. And she will use it, when she is scavenging the fallen Star Destroyer she will be using the Force to look for some metal. She isn't going to be extremely powerful, just strong enough to use it with her in her every day life. I think this is believable, as kids having the force is normal until the Jedi Order takes them away, but since Jakku is nowhere, she wouldn't have been picked up by a Jedi.

stephansbrick,1617422286,mj0vni,28,1,"I enjoy these characters and I want them to be continued in a Star Wars Rebels style TV show of just going from one place to another with small conflicts along the way. Rey can go to many Jedi and Sith temples across the galaxy, learning the history of The Force.

Finn and Poe can continue to be leaders of a NEW New Republic or any government left in the galaxy and tried to hunt down the last remaining First Order troops, Poe can be on the side of just hunting them down while Finn tried to convinced Poe that Stormtroopers should be redeemed or at least have rights to be part of the NEW New Republic.

Rose can live a quiet life while also helping the formation of another government with the memories of her sister guiding her across the galaxy.

And Ben isn't really necessary, but he can be brought back as voices or something like what happened to Kanan in Rebels and just screw around with the crew. K I'll admit, I'm one of those people on the Reylo camp especially after Lego Star Wars Holiday Special when Rey said goodbye to Ben.

The cast can be Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, and BB-8. With Chewie, and Maz as supporting characters, while R2 and 3PO become the recurring characters just when the plot needed them.

There's also doesn't have to be a single goal in the show, we never settle down and just enjoy the ride in the galaxy, there's always a conflict that we should get to and we never see the sights when the galaxy is not in any large conflict, other than the pod racing and multiple cantina scenes.

I would like a Slice of Life esque Star Wars adventure, why not? Maybe one episode they went back into Pod Racing, and the next it's about traveling to a Jedi temple on a green planet.

TheMastersSkywalker,1617413797,miyn11,4,1,"Now I know for some people its just a meme for meme sake or a way to bash legends so if you are one of those people I'm not trying to change your mind. But if you're someone who's never read FotJ and only see the meme mentioned on message boards and want to know what really happens then this post is for you. I'll add some TLDR's at the end but I'm basically going to go book by book. 

But before that I want to mention something outside of Fate or any other series that I think (aside from Anti-Legends people) causes people to think Luke is some kind of force god. IF you go on to Wook you will see that he has a long list of force powers. More powers than any other Jedi on the wook. And even though we have seen multiple other jedi do the same things we have done we have never seen someone do all of them. But the simple explanation isn't that he is some force god. Its that he is the character with the most screen time. Give other jedi 70 books worth of apperances and they will rack up a large move set as well. So I get why some people are under the mistaken belief  that Luke is some sort of force deity. But as I'm going to show he was in no way unbeatable in FotJ nor was he able to destroy Abeloth by himself. 

Outcast: No fights or battles in this one only Ben and Luke learning new techniques. They learn them quickly because the Baran Do sages are using techniques close to what Jedi use.

Omen: Again no battles in this one. Luke does learn to teleport a small object but its more of a part trick for him and less like what Merrin or Mother Talzin can do. 

Abyss: Finally the action starts as the Lost Tribe arrives on the scene. Now something that needs to be said about them is that except for Vestara and the high lords most of the sith are pretty weak. They have been marooned on a planet for 5000 years so they aren't seasoned warriors and their saber styles are way out of date. Still the Lost Tribe members are strong enough that they are able to nearly overwhelm the two Jedi.

Backlash: This is where Luke really starts to get beat up. First he gets sideswiped off his speeder bike by a rancore and goes careening through the jungle. Then while fighting a group of nightsisters he is injured and nearly knocked out and would have died if not for being rescued by his son. 

Allies: Luke, his son, vestara, and around a thousand lost tribe sith and two high lords go to Abeloth's planet to capture or kill her. Abeloth is able to kill the majority of the sith though either force attacks, controlling the plant and animal life, or physically while some are taken out by Luke and Ben when they try and turn on them when it looks like they had finally beaten Abeloth. Still at the end of the day Luke, Ben, Vestara, and two high lords are able to ""kill"" abeloth. And during this Luke ends up more injured and battered than the last time. 

Vortex: Realizing that Abeloth wasn't dead but had moved her spirit into another body (Abeloth by the way for anyone who doesn't know is similar in power and abilities to the Mortis ones. She was in fact the Mother for a time) and had fled. They track her down to a planet where the Fallanassi are located and there Luke and Ben and face off against a Sith Saber and a Sith High Lord who are now helping Abeloth with Vestara at first helping the Sith then helping Luke and Ben. During this fight Luke ends up sustaining broken bones, severe lacerations, and head trauma and its only with Vestara distracting Abeloth (who had already been wounded from the earlier battle) and by giving himself up to the force and possible death is he barely able to defeat her by pulling the roof down on them and impaling her. 

Now before moving on I need to say that the more bodies Abeloth takes the more it spreads out her power and the more it weakens all the bodies. And if one body is destroyed it weakens all the others. It also takes her a long time to heal up from loosing a body and being able to take another. 

Conviction: Still hurt from the last battle Luke and Ben and Ves travel to the planet Nam Chorios where they again run into Abeloth and the Lost Tribe. Use of the force on Nam Chorios is dangerous due to it causing storms across the planet so Luke, Ves, and Ben are unable to use any powers while fighting Abeloth and the Sith. And in fact they are only able to win against the Sith and Abeloth in this fight due to the use of a improvised flash bang that incapacitates the Sith and allows Abeloth to flee. Though she doesn't get off without being increasingly damaged. 

 Ascension: Abeloth visits the Lost Tribe's homeworld of Kesh where she ends up attacking and being attacked by the Grand Lord of the Sith. An attack that cuts her to the core and causes her to lash out in pain destroying the city and loosing her ability to maintain a solid form and turning into a puddle of goup. Luke and a bunch of Jedi meanwhile are investigating an ancient sith world where sith apparently liked to go into tunnels and get high and he and the other jedi have to run away from at first a huge explosion of force power that they are only barely able to get far enough away from. And then have to escape from exploding volcanoes and floods of lava and ash. 

No use of green lighting/electric judgement, no absorbing energy or force powers during fights or in explosions, no controlling lava tsunami's or flying through lava unharmed like his father, no using shatter point, nothing like that so far. 

Apocalypse: Well here we are the final battle. And this one is a doozy. The Lost Tribe have taken the Jedi Temple and the Jedi order along with 300 shock troopers have to take it back. During the fight towards the shield generator Luke, Jaina, and Corran all take massive damage including a concussion causing double vision, a severe laceration along his side making it hard to move, and near exhaustion from drawing on the force to keep going for three days. And during the battle against the pursuing sith  and Abeloth Luke will get his chest and ribs cracked and electrocuted by force lighting. 

The Sith Lord who turns out to be Abeloth is only defeated when Tahiri Vela and Boba Fett destroy another of Abeloth's bodies on a distant moon weakening her for a moment and allowing Luke to fully slice through the body. 

After getting to rest in a bacta tank for three days the group goes off in search of one of Abeloth's two remaining ~~hocruxes~~ bodies while the jedi try to destroy the other one. 

When they finally get to Abeloth's planet three battles are happening at the same time. One on Coruscant with a Jedi Master, a Jedi knight, and a squad of spec forces fighting her avatar on coruscant, a fight on Abeloth's planet physically where Ben and Vestara are fighting her physical body, and a fight inside the force on Mortis where Luke and a mysterious dark stranger (Its Darth Krayt and I hate that he is there but he is) are fighting her spiritual body. Luke and Krayt are only able to defeat her after both her physical avatars are destroyed by the other Jedi and even then they both come out horribly wounded with Luke being near brain dead from damage and exhaustion. 

 Three months later after extensive sessions of healing trances and bacta baths Luke finally comes out of a coma and is still feverish and weak.

And to top it all off Abeloth isn't really killed the way we would think of killing something and more like banished and having to reform herself. Not knowing how long it will take Luke sends off ten knights to hunt down the Dagger of Mortis which according to legend is the only weapon that could kill her for good. 

So there it is. In Fate Luke is never alone when he fights Abeloth and is ever only able to kill her physical avatars because other people were fighting her and distracting her or had weakened her by killing another of her bodies. And during all of that Luke never uses any of the higher level force powers we know he can use or has used in other books. 

So TLDR: In EVERY SINGLE BOOK Luke gets injured and hurt or nearly defeated by opponents and when facing Abeloth requires the help of others to defeat her and doesn't even really kill her in the end but only banishes her. 

So no he isn't a force god. No he doesn't take on Abeloth alone. And no he doesn't use any crazy force powers. Sure if you read the Wook he has more than anyone else but that's because he's been in more books than anyone else since he is kind of the main character of the OT and NR era's. 

I don't know if this has changed anyone's minds but at least when people start saying he took down a force deity by himself you can link to this rant.",StarWars,I just finished Fate of the Jedi and the meme about Luke being a force god and taking Abeloth down by himself couldn't be any more wrong.,8645,1622,5.329839704069051

They make up stories, leaks, and news for clicks and other similar channels and website cite them as a source to perpetuate their own clickbait. 

I know a lot of us luckily recognize this reality, but this is also a general Star Wars subreddit and I've seen a lot of people rightly confused and trying to get clarity on a variety of false rumors on here.

Just last/this week people are raging on Youtube about Brie Larson being in Star Wars, and all the information traces back to a singular source who has reported similar stories on and off for about 2 years now, claiming she's been hired and fired 4 time (sometimes by George Lucas who somehow manages to keep reinstating himself as head of Lucasfilm...) for nebulous movies/tv shows and other projects. I'm not joking. That's not even taking into account his hundreds of false leaks for TFA, TLJ, Rogue One, Mandalorian, etc which one would think would discredit him immediately.

Now of course knowing all that anyone with any degree of common sense could tell this story is false, but that's not what these other sites report. Instead they run the headline that ""Brie Larson is going to be more powerful than Darth Vader"" and everyone floods reddit either freaking out or trying to figure out if this is true or not, when the immediate response should be simple dismissal of the story. They present the source as unbiased and just as valid as any other, and for that reason you really shouldn't trust any non-official site either. They have the common sense to know their source is lying, but just don't care.

A good metric for whether a leak, reveal, or other piece of information is trustworthy is to see if it makes it to the [r/StarWarsLeaks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/)  subreddit. Sources almost always trace back to an official statement from Lucasfilm/affiliates, and the few true  ""leaks"" are treated as such, with posters being far more open to answering questions about how they came across this information. When you can't even get a post approved with a ""Probable BS"" flair, you know its likely a confirmed fabrication.

I know people like watching random channels speculate (I do to) and tell you what they've ""heard"" is going to happen in the next movie/show, but the truth is they will all lie to you, and they'll be the easiest lies they ever have to tell. All they care about is your view and whatever ridiculous story will get you it.

Luke's says ""know"", as in know the difference between good and bad in terms of the light and dark sides of the Force. In Vader suddenly talking about Obi-Wan, Luke briefly become angry. Thanks to his training with Yoda however, he knows how to recognize the difference between good and bad and not succumb to the dark side by giving in to negative emotions (anger in this instance). Watch his expressions closely. He becomes angry, then objectively sort of sees the the good and bad before him (says, ""Know...""), then is able to let the anger go.

Remember that he and Yoda talk about knowing the difference between good and bad. Yoda tells him, ""You will know.""

Also, in ROTJ, Luke says ""know"" in the same way to the Emperor in the same kind of situation. He does says a little weaker as the Emperor is extremely adept at manipulation people's emotions.

Ok since this one is so long I will divide it into 2 separate parts, it was originally one big thread but I decided its best to make it 2 threads. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background info:**

* Instead of 10 years its only been 1 since the events of Episode I, (phantom menace takes place in 23 BBy).
* The Clone Wars has already begun, after the ending of Phantom Menace the C.I.S was formed and split from the Republic, there was unrest in the senate as their peace was being threatened, half the senate were pro war, half were anti war but ultimately the more votes went to war so the Chancellor decided to utilize the Clone Army which showed up at the end of Episode I as the army claim they were sent by a Jedi master, Sifo Dyas who was killed offscreen during the events of Phantom Menace. The Clone Wars has been happening for 2 years and they are trying to figure out where the C.I.S base is.
* The leader of the C.I.S is a Jedi turned Sith named Count Dooku and since the Jedi have been trying to figure out who the secret Sith is, they are extra eager to find the Separatist base so they can capture Dooku, end the war and find out who the secret Sith Lord is.
* As for Anakin &amp; Padme, they have become good friends and at night time Anakin &amp; Padme are sneaking out into the city of Coruscant for mini dates, the only one who is aware is Obi Wan Kenobi who doesn't turn Anakin in because he promised a dying Qui Gon Jinn he'd train the chosen one. Padme has passed the torch of queen of Naboo and she is now a member of the senate on Coruscant

**The Story:**

* The main plotline is trying to find the C.I.S base. But at the same time Anakin is starting to have premonitions of his mother dying and its tearing him apart. The Jedi haven't allowed him to visit his mother &amp; brother on Tatooine because the Jedi aren't meant to have relations.
* In the opening scene Obi Wan gets a strange messages saying ""you took everything from me, now I will take everything from you"" then that night in Coruscant there is an attempt on Anakin's life while he's seeing Padme. The bounty hunter who attacked him is a shapeshifter and there is an extended chase through Coruscant where she changes form numerous time it leads to a bar where she goes in for the kill before Anakin &amp; Obi Wan immobilize her by getting her in the leg. She is about to reveal who sent her before an unseen killer fires a toxic dart into her.
* The origins of the Clone army is still unknown and they have no leads beyond Sifo Dyas sent them, as well as that its unknown exactly who killed Dyas. The clones have the command of not revealing where they came from embedded into their chips.
* Anakin's night terrors are getting to him so he decides he must go back to Tatooine to save his mother. In the thick of night of he sneaks off to Tatooine which when Mace Windu finds out about it pisses him off, (Anakin v Mace Windu have a rivalry in all 3 of these films), Obi Wan is pissed when he finds out but Yoda thinks its great that Anakin is looking out for his family.
* Obi Wan reveals he has been doing some research and has traced the toxic dart to a species called Kaminoans who reside on the watery planet of Kamino just outside the Republic, its said they are cloners and Obi Wan is sent to investigate the planet and try find out if they are the creators the Clone Army. When Obi Wan leaves however unknown to him a hooded figure on Coruscant shoots a tracking device onto his ship.
* So when Anakin goes to Tatooine &amp; Obi Wan goes to Kamino that portion of the film is the same as the real one with one addition. Obi Wan on Kamino is the exact same. Anakin one Tatooine as well except he is excited to see Owen Skywalker his blood brother and is happy to see him free, of course Shmi's death is the same and Anakin murders the Sand People the same.
* In the outer rim territories various Clone units are deployed to different planets, a large group of Clone Trooper's lead by Commander Cody land on the planet of Geonosis and begin their search of the planet. They find a whole lot of C.I.S ships and contact Master Windu to tell him. Then they are attacked by a group of droids and a Sith Lord who shoots them with lightning when all the droids are dead. Only commander Cody makes it out alive.
* Since Obi Wan is heading to Geonosis following Jango Fett, the hooded figure who has been following Obi Wan is following the both of them.
* Master Windu decides to go with a bunch of Jedi and an entire legion of Clone Trooper's (the 187th wearing purple armor) to Geonosis.
* The whole scene in the Asteroid field is the same however Obi Wan on the Asteroid is not something we see.
* Immediately the bounty hunter lands on the planet he enters a dark room and is followed by that hooded figure (who we don't see), the hooded figure tells Fett he stole his kill in a very angry voice then he begins to force choke the man before unveiling a double bladed red lightsaber and cutting him in two.
* Next it's revealed Obi Wan survived the asteroids but his ship was damaged and now he is crash landing into the planet. He sends a message to grand master Yoda who is on his way to Geonosis to come rescue him, Yoda tells him they are on their way. Obi Wan is then captured like in the real film. Obi Wan before he is captured though finds Commander Cody and he too is captured with him.
* Anakin on Tatooine senses Obi Wan is in danger and he tells Padme he's going to rescue Obi Wan, Cliegg Lars as a gift tells Anakin he can take C3PO with him, and this is where R2D2 meets C3PO for the first time. He tells Padme to stay there and she ""agrees"", (she stows away onboard ofc) and Anakin heads for Geonosis.
* So everyone is heading for the C.I.S home world.

thelegend90210,1617295013,mhz7wy,7,1,"So a lot of people believe that force healing makes anakins loss of padme pointless because he could just force heal her. But force healing is actually described as sharing force energy by Rey. Now there’s a popular theory that palpatine took energy from padme to save Vader, killing her. Now this is force healing. Palpatine took the energy from padme and gave it to Vader to heal him. Maybe because he didn’t want to share his own energy. We also know that saving someone from the dead with force healing kills yourself, as seen with Ben and Rey. But healing a scar or non fatal slice won’t kill you. Rey heals Kylos cut, grogu healed greefs cut. Because none of them were dead, it was only a cut that would probably take more time to actually kill them. And as for qui gon and obi wan, I don’t think the Jedi would actually teach force healing. It invalidates the no attachments rule. I have a theory that the Jedi didn’t make force healing public since people would lose faith, thinking their code is nonsense. So obi wan wouldn’t know force healing. And also, qui gon was dead by the time obi wan got to him. And we know that healing from death kills yourself.

So yeah, palpatine force healed anakin by killing padme like how Ben solo gave his life to save Rey. Because force healing is actually sharing energy, not just a heal.",StarWars,Force healing in rise of skywalker doesn’t contradict anakin not saving padme at all.,1334,245,5.444897959183673

Obi wan pushed forward threw the battle and realizes Anakin is not near, he turns around to se Anakin just standing there facing away from him. Obi shouts Anakin’s name then eventually runs over to him and say Anakin we need to leave as he turn Anakin around to see his face. What Obi wan then sees is how Anakin looked when Obi wan left him for dead on Mustafar, burnt and scared. Obi wan is horrified. You then here the “I HATE YOU” scream the last words Anakin said to Obi wan. We then cut to a shot of Obi wan waking up panting and sweating.

I wanted to share two theories I came up as to where she comes from:

1: She’s an experimental clone of Jango Fett. Given that the Bad Batch show is all about several clones who are genetically modified, it isn’t impossible that one clone was modified to be female.

2: She’s a clone from a different genetic template. In the Season 3 Episode 1 Clone Wars episode *”Clone Cadets”* (coincidentally the episode that intrigues Echo and the derogatory-to-clones term “Bad Batch”), Lama Su reports to Shaak Ti that the Jango Fett DNA is becoming degraded and over-used, and that the Jedi should bring in an alternative genetic template. Perhaps the Jedi found a woman to be a new template to supplement the Jango clones, who ended up being the parent to Omega? It would also mean that she was aged much faster than a double-speed Jango clone, given she looked about ten and couldn’t be older than three (given the length of the clone wars).

I also feel that she looks distinctly Mandalorian with her blonde hair (similar to Satine, but not saying they’re genetically related).

Recently I talked to a friend about the whole thing of Skywalkers having their hand cut off and I thought it'd be fitting if Rey had something like that (or perhaps creating her own path in spite of her genes/family). But anyway, I thought about this whole thing of Skywalkers getting their hand cut off (by a powerful Sith) and it being sort of a ""baptism"" for a Skywalker, meaning they are, through that hardship, becoming a ""true Skywalker"", or at least a powerful, consagrated, true jedi. Let's go over each dismemberment:

* In AOTC, Anakin gets his hand cut off by a powerful Sith (Dooku). Between that and ROTS he becomes a Jedi Knight and one of (if not the most) powerful Jedi of that time.

* In ESB, Luke gets his hand cut off by a powerful Sith (Vader). Between that and ROTJ he trains with Yoda and becomes a very powerful Jedi (since most are dead, possibly the most powerful).

But in ROTJ, during the climatic fight in the ending, Luke gives into his anger and cuts off Vader's hand. At that exact moment, Luke is the Sith and Vader is the Jedi, and to me that signifies the exact moment where Vader turns to the light side and becomes redeemed again (Vader betrays the Emperor on the very next scene), and Luke is at a crossroads.

This would make sense because the Sith essentially see it as a tool they can manipulate and the Jedi connect with it. Also, Luke killing Vader and Palpatine would bring balance this way.

On the other hand, in the sequel movies, Snoke explained to Kylo the stronger he becomes in the dark side, it is only natural that Rey will grow stronger in the light.

First, while flying through hyperspace WAC-47 tells Gascon that they detected comets ahead and are going to collide with them. Col. Gascon gets to the cockpit and finds the alarms blaring. He checks the displays and immediately drops the ship out of hyperspace to find they're in the middle of a field of comets. The comets do not appear to be much larger than the shuttle they are flying. It seems that this is further evidence pre-Disney canon allowed for the possibility that an object in hyperspace can collide with a relatively small object in real space. Why else would the alarms be going off? Why would Col. Gascon drop out of hyperspace unless he was afraid if colliding with the objects? 

Second, when Col. Gascon gets to the cockpit hyperspace is all red and not blue. &gt;!This is the same way it was described in LOTJ when the Legacy Run collided with the Nihil ship.!&lt; I never noticed this before and thought it was a new idea in LOTJ.

One scene that I just read (almost done with the book) was where Thrawn met Anakin Skywalker. I’ll say that it was probably my favorite part of the book because I wasn’t familiar with the entire Chiss people and their politics and worlds and having a well-known character in the book made it easier for me to comprehend the scene and enjoy it. 

Anyways, for those that have read the book, what is your review of it?",StarWars,"If you are debating on whether to read the book Thrawn Ascendancy Chaos Rising or not, read here",779,151,5.158940397350993
Eli_Freeman_Author,1617175430,mh0l6g,0,1,"To be clear, this isn't something that I necessarily want, and if Star Wars writers decide to go down this path at this point, I hope they have a good explanation, as I don't want this to feel like a ""cheap trick"", but it's hard (at least for me) not to speculate on the possibility and the story potential, considering who Ezra ends up with, and where else he might go.

So what would compel me to ask a question like that?  Well, a simple two word answer is:  Jacen Syndulla.  I remember feeling fairly surprised when I first saw him, not just that Kanan and Hera had a child but also at what he looked like; I barely noticed his green hair at first, his only Twi'lek feature (as far as I can tell).  Compared to the children of Cut Lawquane (who are actually the children of Lawquane's Twi'lek wife and another Human male) this doesn't seem to make much sense.  Lawquane's children have mostly Twi'lek features, which led me to believe that Twi'lek features are dominant.

It's possible that the writers behind Star Wars don't know much about genetics and recessive vs. dominant traits, and/or don't much care, and to be honest, if they can come up with a good story, I don't really care either, even if it's a bit confusing.

As far as Ezra, it is known that both his parents are human, though nothing is known of his ancestry beyond that.  There may be some very interesting possibilities if Ezra has some sort of connection to the person who becomes his arch-nemesis, and all the more so if he ends up in the Chiss Ascendancy.  Even if he turns out NOT to be Chiss speculation about who he is might make for an interesting discussion as a part of his story, who can say?  Maybe even a social commentary about unhealthy preoccupation with one's background based on one's traits/appearance?

Maybe the whole thing is a moot point.  There may be some groups of humans in Star Wars who have naturally colored hair (unlike Sabine), or perhaps Ezra has some other alien species in his ancestry (Twi'lek?).  According to some sources, the blue was a ""stylistic"" choice, and that it would ""look better in animation"".  Who knows?  Most ""official"" sources, like Wookiepedia, now list his hair color as ""black"", though it was previously listed as ""blue"".  Maybe this is to prepare for Mena Massoud taking over the role, and hopefully he'll do a good job.

In any case, whatever his hair color and whatever significance it may or may not have, I hope the writers come up with a good, worthwhile story, though I hope that in the future they also pay a bit more attention to detail, and don't throw in things as much ""just because"".",StarWars,Is Ezra Bridger Part Chiss?

AnnoyedAmature,1617148268,mgta62,5,1,"I have been thinking about Snoke over the past several years, since The Last Jedi and I firmly believe that you could make him a more interesting villain. In my eyes, he would be the maintain antagonist for the entire Sequel trilogy and is Palpatine does not return except as a manifestation of the Force. For my version of Snoke, I had to completely re-write his entire back story and even parts of the post-Endor era for him to better fit in the story.

Snoke is a lowly, yet devoted scholar devoid of any Force powers, he records and studies sith artefacts for His imperial majesty, Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant. He is sent across the galaxy scaring for any ancient sith objects that willing to help achieve his master's plan and same time Snoke becomes increasingly obsessed with the Force and its nature. Despite being non-Force sensitive he wonders if any of these sith holocrons or scrolls contain the ability to grant normal being access to the Force. When the death of Palpatine reaches Coruscant, Snoke wastes no time in gathering as many sith holocrons and artefacts as he can and flees the imperial capital and head out towards to Outer Rim. He meets up with an imperial fleet and used his skills of manipulation and position on Coruscant you to convince them to obey his orders. He uses the resources of this imperial fleet to explore sith ruins and old temples to uncover more knowledge of the sith.

However, as Snoke's knowledge grows, so does the strength of the newly established New Galactic Republic (yes slight name change) as Imperial forces facture. Snoke reluctantly follows his fleet into the Unknown Region along with many other rogue Imperial force, however, his knowledge of former temples and strongholds allows his group to find a suitable area to set up a new base. As any of the remaining imperial struggles to determine who to lead, Snoke uses the chaos to his advantage to build mistrust among the power grabbers. He gives that appearance of neutrality while encouraging others to murder their competition and he builds groups of loyal followers through his knowledge of the Force. As competitors dwindle, Snoke kills those who remain in his way and become the leaders of this rogue Imperial Remnant faction, proclaiming the First Order.

Over the decades Snoke discovers a ritual that could grant him what he desires but requires ritual be done on Korriband/Morband with the blood of one born of Force, thus begins his search to be sacrificed. While he searches for his sacrifice, Snoke also orders the kidnapping of Force-sensitive to create a loyal group of Force-sensitive enforcers, the Knights of Ren, much like the Imperial Inquisitors of Palpatine. While Snoke focuses on his projects, the First Order engages in mass militarization with new foundries and shipyards constructed.

While the First Orders has managed to build new ships like the Resurgent-class star destroyer (my version is smaller than canon one), they still rely on ageing Imperial II-class star destroyers, though they have been modernized the best they could. It is important to note that the First Order military is not a cable of the New Galactic Republic's military, but Snoke and First Order high command have taken this into account. The First Order is not the only Imperial Remnant group, in fact, some remnant factions have been legitimate governments with a thriving society, while others remain in disarray. The First Order plans to stark another war between the New Republic and other Imperial Remnant factions while they would take advantage of the chaos and Snoke could head to Korriband/Morband to perform the ritual.

I know there are lots and lots more than the half dozen listed on the wiki page. Unfortunately, I'm currently limited to what information I can get from the movies, shows, and wikis, so anything coming from other sources like novels, comics, games, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

In particular, I'm basically looking for a Nissan Leaf scaled up to a starship. I'm looking for something fairly small, preferably something that could be crewed by one or two people (but not the obvious Millennium Falcon, YT-1300f), but have enough space to hold a couple dozen at most. If possible, something with a fairly sleek but almost boxy design, somewhere between an Eta 2 and an Allanar or a YV. But more important than looks is that I don't want it to be something that's particularly significant - I would use the Allanar if it wasn't particularly used by the Empire to transport supplies, or the Ghtroc 690 if it hadn't come from the stupid sequel saga (even more so that it was used by Rey herself) - I don't wanna touch the sequels with a 50 foot pole.

So, put simply, the order of my priorities goes that it has to be in the right size range (small enough to be piloted by a couple people but big enough to carry a dozen or two), then that it can't be something particularly noteworthy to the series, and then that I want it to look fairly decent.

AnnoyedAmature,1617143594,mgrt0b,1,1,"I have been thinking about Snoke over the past several years, since The Last Jedi and I firmly believe that you could make him a more interesting villain. In my eyes, he would be the maintain antagonist for the entire Sequel trilogy and is Palpatine does not return except as a manifestation of the Force. For my version of Snoke, I had to completely re-write his entire back story and even parts of the post-Endor era for him to better fit in the story.

Snoke is a lowly, yet devoted scholar devoid of any Force powers, he records and studies sith artefacts for His imperial majesty, Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant. He is sent across the galaxy scaring for any ancient sith objects that willing to help achieve his master's plan and same time Snoke becomes increasingly obsessed with the Force and its nature. Despite being non-Force sensitive he wonders if any of these sith holocrons or scrolls contain the ability to grant normal being access to the Force. When the death of Palpatine reaches Coruscant, Snoke wastes no time in gathering as many sith holocrons and artefacts as he can and flees the imperial capital and head out towards to Outer Rim. He meets up with an imperial fleet and used his skills of manipulation and position on Coruscant you to convince them to obey his orders. He uses the resources of this imperial fleet to explore sith ruins and old temples to uncover more knowledge of the sith.

However, as Snoke's knowledge grows, so does the strength of the newly established New Galactic Republic (yes slight name change) as Imperial forces facture. Snoke reluctantly follows his fleet into the Unknown Region along with many other rogue Imperial force, however, his knowledge of former temples and strongholds allows his group to find a suitable area to set up a new base. As any of the remaining imperial struggles to determine who to lead, Snoke uses the chaos to his advantage to build mistrust among the power grabbers. He gives that appearance of neutrality while encouraging others to murder their competition and he builds groups of loyal followers through his knowledge of the Force. As competitors dwindle, Snoke kills those who remain in his way and become the leaders of this rogue Imperial Remnant faction, proclaiming the First Order.

Over the decades Snoke discovers a ritual that could grant him what he desires but requires ritual be done on Korriband/Morband with the blood of one born of Force, thus begins his search to be sacrificed. While he searches for his sacrifice, Snoke also orders the kidnapping of Force-sensitive to create a loyal group of Force-sensitive enforcers, the Knights of Ren, much like the Imperial Inquisitors of Palpatine. While Snoke focuses on his projects, the First Order engages in mass militarization with new foundries and shipyards constructed.

While the First Orders has managed to build new ships like the Resurgent-class star destroyer (my version is smaller than canon one), they still rely on ageing Imperial II-class star destroyers, though they have been modernized the best they could. It is important to note that the First Order military is not a cable of the New Galactic Republic's military, but Snoke and First Order high command have taken this into account. The First Order is not the only Imperial Remnant group, in fact, some remnant factions have been legitimate governments with a thriving society, while others remain in disarray. The First Order plans to stark another war between the New Republic and other Imperial Remnant factions while they would take advantage of the chaos and Snoke could head to Korriband/Morband to perform the ritual.

So, what do you think so far?",StarWars,My take on Snoke,3674,617,5.954619124797407

Charman68,1617135501,mgozyw,2,1,"Just some quick thoughts I had. All of these aren’t related.

1. Omega is an early attempt at a force sensitive clone. Obviously they are important in some way because they are in the show and have that little jewel thing on their head. It woud also go with the theme of all of the Bad Batch members having some kind of special/modified quality or talent to them.
2. At this time, the Empire is considering keeping their military full of clones and not replacing them with people. This is why there is still a young clone, Omega, in the facility. At one point, the Bad Batch are convinced to free many other clones from their control chip in a large scale event, leading to a small uprising against the Empire from this group of ”freed” clones. They are all eventually defeated, but convince the Empire to stop creating more clones and to start recruiting.
3. Again, regarding Omega, even if the rest of the Bad Batch die in the end, which is somewhat likely, Omega will survive and come up in future Star Wars material. No matter what her role ends up being, I think that Star Wars is currently trying to connect everything up more (which I love), and they could appear in future games or tv shows as a bigger character.

If you noticed anything in the trailer that completely contradicts these, please let me know. I am just now realizing that the second one is less of a theory and more of something that I very much want to happen because it would be cool, but whatever.",StarWars,Bad Batch Theory,1474,271,5.439114391143911

Xene1042_Genesis,1617134140,mgohm7,16,1,"Hi everyone, especially those Clone Wars enthusiasts!

I am working on a secret project of mine that involves scenes from Star Wars movies, series or any fan-made thing that is good quality.

I would love to find a scene where clone/s (preferably with their helmets off) speak at the same time in a choir-like formation. Basically, I would like to remove the original sound and replace it with a song. For a few scenes, I’d like it to seem that the clones are singing together.

Scenes with just one clone are ok, but I’d love to find one where this criteria is met.

I’m also looking for other scenes, I’ll probably make more posts like this in the future. But here are a few (no need to be Clone Wars, can be any Star Wars content). Thank you very much.

1-A scene where a character (preferably male) faints or seems very tired because they just did something very intense, bonus points if he’s happy for what he just did.

2-Scenes where someone leading the clones makes a “advance” move, something like that jedi did defending Ryloth.

3-Any good quality animation/creation where one or more characters are singing.

4- A scene where someone says something on the lines of “I wasn’t expecting this for months”, “I thought this would’ve taken longer” or something like that.

6- A good motivational speech to troops (apart from the one by General Hux)

7- Best romantic scenes (that are not in the movies, I know those 😂)

8- Best military decission-making scenes

That’s all for now. Thank you again!",StarWars,Looking for some specific scenes in Star Wars!,1504,264,5.696969696969697

ereneau1355,1617072692,mg6846,5,1,"Ok so I’m gonna tell you all about my experience watching Star Wars for the first time so here we go. 

My first experience with Star Wars was when I was 5 years old with the Leapster Explorer Star Wars the Clone Wars. The leapster was a gaming system for little kids that taught basic stuff such as math and reading. My parents bought me this game for some reason and I really liked it. I don’t know why but I specifically remember the droidekas from that game. 

My second experience came from the Force Awakens, a full 5 years after I had played the previous game. My parents rented it from RedBox and although I had no idea what was going on I liked the movie but didn’t put much more thought into it. 

Then for some reason, two years after I had watched the force awakens I decided that I wanted to get into Star Wars. Somehow my uncle found out about this and since he owned all the movies digitally he of course let me watch one of the movies. I decided I wanted to start from the beginning and watched the phantom menace. Once again I had no idea what was going on, but I realized that the boys name was anakin skywalker. I knew who Luke skywalker was despite never watching anything else Star Wars, and knew that darth vader was his dad also. I figured that Anakin must have been darth vader and so I somewhat spoiled the reveal of Anakins betrayal by googling what happened. 

At this point I don’t really remember the complete order of how I watched the rest of Star Wars but I believe that I watched a bunch of movie clips on YouTube of both the prequels and originals and then I watched rogue one for free on Netflix. Once again I was continuing to watch Star Wars in the worst way possible. 

After understanding the basic plot of all the Star Wars movies I finally got the chance to see one in theaters with the last Jedi. A month after it was released I went to the theaters with my mom and I loved it. I thought it was great couldn’t wait until the sequel came out. I was of course super surprised to see that a lot of people didn’t like the movie but I didn’t let that bother me too much. In present day I still love the last Jedi but I think that a story like this would have been a lot better if it was always meant to be non-canon (of course it would never have been a movie if it was non-canon but still) and I do hope all of the sequels are removed from canon despite how much I like the last Jedi. 

Finally after all this I got the original trilogy for Christmas and I thought they were great. I don’t have much else to say about them they were just really good. 

I believe I might have watched all of the clone wars tv show before the original trilogy and the last Jedi but I don’t really remember. I only know that I watched the clone wars before I watched...

The prequel trilogy. After this long journey I finally watched both attack of the clones and revenge of the sith on Disney plus. I don’t know why I didn’t buy the movies or rent the movies before waiting until Disney plus released but I did. Going into the movies I knew they would have a lot of problems so I knew to not let them bother me. I didn’t care for attack of the clones but thought that revenge of the sith was genius. I knew it could have been better of course, but that it was still the best Star Wars movie by far in my opinion. 

Finally the rise of skywalker was released and before watching it I knew that the reception was not going to be good and that Disney should reboot the sequel trilogy. Still, on my first watch of it in theaters I really liked it, but wasn’t that crazy about it. Then on a rewatch a few months later I realized that it wasn’t that good and that is still how I feel about it. 

If you read all of that thanks for reading it. I just thought it was kind of funny how awful of a way I watched all of the movies.",StarWars,The perfect way to watch Star Wars for the first time,3840,750,5.12
onex7805,1617071710,mg5xun,4,1,"As a whole of the Prequel Trilogy, one of the top three baffling decisions Lucas made was making Anakin's love interest a *politician*. Her role inevitably separated her character from Anakin's journey as a Jedi, leaving no room for them to grow their love together. Anakin fights because he is a warrior, and Padmé talks with other politicians because she is a politician.

Her role kept changing in each installment has not helped it. She turns from a Queen of Naboo, to a feisty Senator, to Anakin's loyal wife. Her role in ROTS was especially wasted since she had nothing to do other than birthing Luke and Leia. It lacks consistency in her characterization. Compare this to Leia, who was the politician and the princess, but kept her role of the fierce Rebel military leader on the screen consistently. What is worse is that we already have a politician character in the Prequels to show the galactic-wide politics to the audience, and that is Bail Organa. 

Meanwhile, *Ahsoka* in The Clone Wars creates a far interesting character dynamic with Anakin. Be together often as comrades, kicking droid asses, learning, growing, and bonding. They are far more together than Anakin is with Padme. Although we now accept Ahsoka is part of the Prequels, when The Clone Wars first introduced in 2008, the inclusion of Anakin's apprentice in the already established Prequel lore was... a hot potato for a while. She was never mentioned in the films, contributed nothing, felt like an unnecessary addition to the series in the earlier seasons.

There is a way to blend these two concepts together. If Padmé was Anakin's *female Padawan apprentice*, not only it would have made the story far more exciting, it would have justified a lot of elements about Anakin's character arc. For example, Anakin's forbidden romance with his apprentice, Padme, makes more sense than the Jedi dogma forbidding anyone from having a romance. Anakin and his apprentice having to hide their feelings during the battlefield, under the watch of the Jedi Council and Obi-Wan. They develop the master-and-apprentice forbidden love as the war continues, but when the Jedi Council finds out about their relationship, they excommunicate her from the Order like Ashoka's arc in The Clone Wars. You can even have the Jedi Council separating Anakin's children from him, which enrages him to stir away from the Jedi's path.

With this hypothetical Padawan Padmé concept, let's reimagine the trilogy.

In **The Phantom Menace**, the Queen of Naboo should not be Padme. She is a separate character. Maybe set the Naboo setting to Alderaan and call her Breha Antilles. Maybe Padme's character can appear as a minor role, but I do not know how to go about it.

This Jedi Padme gets introduced in **Attack of the Clones**. Before knighting a Padawan Anakin to be a Jedi Knight, the Council decides to test him first. The Council assigns him a mission and a human female Padawan, Padme, to take her as a temporary apprentice. Their initial dynamic plays similarly to The Clone Wars movie. They do not like each other at first but they bond together, develop feelings as they are sent on a mission. Set up the Jedi code that a Jedi cannot fall in love with another Jedi because it would distract a Jedi from doing their duty. The end of Attack of the Clones should not have a full-on marriage between the two but, it should plant a seed for what is to come.

**The Clone Wars** series can explore these two character's growing relationships. Ahsoka and Anakin's dynamic is already present but added with a romantic angle.

In **Revenge of the Sith**, after the battle of Coruscant, Anakin returns to the Jedi Temple. He finds there is a trial going on. This is where you can do the Ahsoka excommunication arc from The Clone Wars. Padme has become pregnant, which causes the Jedi Council to discover the forbidden romance between Anakin and Padme. Obi-Wan, a Jedi Council member, gets summoned as a witness for the trial and gives testimonies on the relationship between Anakin and Padme. Mace Windu wants to outcast both Anakin and Padme, but Obi-Wan at least prevents the Council from excommunicating Anakin. Anakin's chance for a Mastership is gone. Anakin is enraged at the Jedi Council. He enraged at Obi-Wan. All these cause him to turn to the dark side. This is where Palpatine fits in, persuading him that the Jedi will take their child away. This is a far simpler, but effective motivation for him to turn dark than Anakin having a vision about Padme dying, which comes across as rather contrived.

Padme goes a Grey Jedi as Ahsoka did in TCW, which also makes for an interesting storyline for the OT era. They can meet again and duel as Ahsoka did in **Rebels** without retconning Return of the Jedi, in which Leia tells Luke Padme was alive during Leia's childhood.

bandras97,1617059015,mg20uz,12,1,"This movie contradicts and retcons so many story elements that I wonder how some people at Disney were like “Yeah, this is it guys, we’ve done it, they’re gonna love this?!”...

So let’s see...Palpatine. Yeah, he was killed as part of Darth Vader’s redemption, a heroic act done to save his very own son, sacrificing himself in the process, out of love. Sure, why not bring Palpatine back out of nowhere with a massive fleet of Star Destroyers, each equipped with a mini Death Star, not only making Anakin’s sacrifice look totally worthless, but also making no sense at all, making one question why he hadn’t utilized the Final Order’s deadly fleet much sooner to annihilate the Resistance or at least revealed himself to the First Order instead of playing around with a puppet (a.k.a. Snoke).

Then Rey. In TFA it was hinted that she COULD be related to a powerful, famous Jedi, hence the extremely strong connection to the Force and Anakin/Luke’s lightsaber calling to her and even triggering flashbacks upon physical contact. Then in TLJ we learned that Rey was in fact a “nobody”, the child of some unknown drunken scavengers on Jakku. The message of this was that you can be your own person and succeed without having to be related to a famous Jedi (Skwalker, Kenobi, etc.). THEN, in TROS they throw all that away and reveal that Rey is in fact Palpatine’s granddaughter...But why? It’s a weak explanation as to why she’d been such a Mary Sue all this time and a lackluster attempt at bringing back the already deceased big bad of the saga for a selling point. Anyway, Palps is beaten again in a ridiculously short and boring “fight”, everyone’s happy and there’s peace again in the universe. So when Rey’s asked about her identity she assumes the Skywalker name, emphasizing that blood shouldn’t define who you are and you should be your own person. Familiar, right? Yeah, WE’VE ALREADY HEARD THIS MESSAGE IN TLJ, so TROS spits in its own face by disregarding its own rules set up earlier.

Now Finn. His character arc had always been kind of strange, never seeming to truly find his place or purpose. One thing’s sure: he was always supposed to be the deserted pawn of the bad guys that turns into a hero on the opposition’s side. It was never even remotely hinted at that he could be something more than most others, then suddenly in TROS it is pretty much confirmed that he is Force sensitive. Never to be seen or heard again, though...

Reylo: Even though there had always been some kind of a tension between the two, it was much likely due to how both saw the pull of the other side and their possible future, as well as a possibly ally to turn to their own side in each other. Both of them complementing the other and slowly presenting the looming shadow of their possible fates (Rey on the Dark Side and Kylo giving into the Light within himself) made for a pretty interesting duo but there never was a need for them to fall in love, nor was it ever really hinted at. Yet, they kissed for...you know, reasons. Fan service at its best, I guess.

Force powers: I felt like Rey shooting lightning from her fingertips, a power that we’ve only seen done by some of the most experienced Sith, was utterly stupid and a cheap way of foreshadowing her relation to Palpatine. Also, the addition of the new Force Heal ability, an already established power in the EU was a nice touch, however, they took it too far by one Force user being able to transfer their life essence to someone else and dying in the process.

Kylo’s redemption: Let me make this clear: I loved that scene in the movie and it made me emotional. But, as many of us know it well, it was originally Anakin Skywalker’s ghost who was supposed to appear to Kylo/Ben. It would’ve made much more sense as he’d been obsessed with Anakin’s Sith persona and seeing his grandfather’s true self and hearing him ask him not to make the same mistakes that he once did would’ve made for a much more powerful scene. Instead, Kylo sees the man he himself killed and supposedly always hated, hears him talk about stuff he already knows and suddenly he does a 180 degree turn and runs to Rey’s help.

MERC_1,1617054297,mg0eoj,21,1,"Ever heard that Start Wars is not Science Fiction, but Space Opera?  
So have I, but I didn't read the definition. I thought that it meant a grand story like an opera but set in space. 

Well, that's not the meaning at all. It's an expression first used by Wilson Tucker in 1941 for Soap Opera style Science Fiction of the worst kind! He described it as: A ""hacky, grinding, stinking, outworn, spaceship yarn"". Well, that's not how I would describe Star Wars.

It has later been redefined a few times at least. With Hartwell and Cramer defining it as: 

""...colorful, dramatic, large-scale science fiction adventure, competently and sometimes beautifully written, usually focused on a sympathetic, heroic central character and plot action, and usually set in the relatively distant future, and in space or on other worlds, characteristically optimistic in tone. It often deals with war, piracy, military virtues, and very large-scale action, large stakes.""

This sound a bit better as describing Star Wars, but it misses a few points. I would not describe it as overly optimistic. It's more about making it against all odds, but maybe that is the optimism? Also, it may well be a description of Star Wars used to define Space Opera. Any insights would be great! 

So, what are the things that make up Star Wars from a literary standpoint?

MisterSisteri,1617039131,mfurzu,0,1,"Get ready to read, but I assure you, I will give you some insight and characterization to a clone you may've not even heard about or at least don't remember. He was only in 2 episodes in the show after all. So please, for Denal's sake, who died valiantly after almost defeating Cad Bane, read this post...


Look Denal was one of the OG Clones of the 501st, and was a Veteran Trooper, a baddass much like Rex. Survived multiple battles alongside Rex and Anakin. Literally kinda more skilled than Rex, but only in two areas. Shooting a DC-15a and hacking &amp; splicing computers. Rex is a master with a DC-17 Blaster Pistol but Denal is JUST as good with a Dc-15a, he's probably better with it than Cody. DENAL COULD PROBABLY SURPASS CODY IN SKILL GIVEN THE TIME. Let's be honest here bois, that is fact. Denal shoots his blaster VERY fast and he has survived an encounter with Grievous, not many Clones without plot-armor can say that. Finally Denal talked about having experience with hacking, as he asked Rex if he could open the locked door they were at. So that means he has some experience in hacking and splicing which we know Rex has none in that area.

Denal is more OG than Fives, Echo, Hardcase, Jesse, Kix or any other member of the 501st you spit at me. The only person that can maybe be more OG is that Clone who was apart of Torrent Company in the movie and came back in Season 7 and almost  died from the fury of Maul (Forgot his name), but lets be honest. With how skilled at surviving or almost surviving... (Flashback to him almost defeating Cad Bane *Crys a single tear*) impossible encounters there is a GOOD chance one of the clone survivors of Torrent Company in the movie was actually Denal, so he is still the most OG clone. I would NOT be surprised if he was one of the clones with Anakin in the towers on Cristophsis. Almost guaranteed actually, given how bad the situation and how good Denal is at getting out of bad situations. 

Now let's be honest here bois, Denal was no doubt ARC trooper level, only survivor of the that Listening Post in Duel of the Droids (forgot its name again and too lazy to look it up) and Rex doesn't count, he's Rex after all... (And neither does that Clone Pilot, he wasn't there for literally any of it. Wouldn't be surprised if his name was Coward or something). Sad thing is he never got out of the Phase 1 armor Era, which had no newly trained ARC Troopers, like Fives &amp; Echo. The only ARCs in the Phase 1 Era were either Null-Class or Commanders or Captains like Rex and Cody. Only during Phase 2 was regular clone troopers that proved to be exceptional in combat selected to be trained to be ARC Troopers. So Denal never had the chance.

There is no doubt, and this even isn't opinion, that Denal would've made ARC Trooper WAY before the bois did (Fives &amp; Echo) if he just barely survived his fateful encounter with Cad Bane or didn't go at all (Wait I'm a fanfiction writer... I could write his survival...?). Denal's veterancy would've no doubt proved incredibly useful during the Citadel and on Umbara. He and Rex could've probably taken on a squad of Citadel Commando droids by themselves, and on Umbara Denal would be kind of a middle ground between Krell &amp; Dogma and Rex, Fives, Hardcase, and Jesse. Let me explain, Denal seems like a no-nonsense and somewhat of a by-the-book type of Clone much like Cody, but does have some independent and risky natures, like Rex. He's in the gray area for the Clones, which is kinda rare. Denal's not like Cody and Dogma who follow orders without question yet he is similar, and he's not like the risky and incredibly independent Rex and Fives (And technically Hardcase, he is an extreme of the example), yet again... very similar. In the 501st that is a rare thing, given that you always have extremes of each example, Dogma never questioned his orders and only wanted to serve the GAR and the Jedi. Hardcase said f*ck that shit and just essentially ignored Krell's suicidal orders and questioned him around every turn. You can't find many 501st Clones in the ""gray"" area, even Rex isn't one like you might expect. Rex is an always follow orders kind of guy but when it comes to suicidal and idiotic plans or assaults he will question it until the end of time, and he only gives in to the idiotic plans because he's so loyal and in the end a Clone, who is bred specifically for utmost loyalty (Anakin's plans don't count, Rex'll always do those without question). 

Now this may trigger you a bit... Denal is such a 501st veteran and been with Rex for so long that we'd likely see Denal as Rex's second instead of Fives. Fives is best bro yes, i am in no way in hell denying that (If i was I'd be a heretic). But just think about it. Fives only became apart of the 501st because of the Rishi Moon incident, and was quite a bit after Denal mainly did his thing (I believe, i may be wrong). So when Fives became a idk... PFC or PVT, Denal was most likely a Sergeant or Lieutenant by then (At the time of the Duel of the Droids episode, i believe Denal was only a Sergeant, 100%, it just makes the most sense). So being the second only ARC Trooper in the 501st (Rex was the first, and Denal's training would be before Fives and Echo's), and i think the second highest rank (Both formally and in Rex's eyes ;) as ""Experience outranks everything"" and Denal, no doubt has the expertise &amp; experience) Denal would be Rex's second in command. Of course Anakin and Ahsoka would be above him but in terms of Clones, Denal is second in command. I am tempted to call it fact as it almost is given the prior evidence and assumption, but i can't call it that because we sadly didn't see it, as Denal fell fighting Cad Bane, who was the Boba Fett of the time. 

Denal is sleeped on Clone and absolutely deserves more recognition. Given his veterancy, Denal could have single-handedly swayed the outcome of any battle he was in.

faizanalam,1617032331,mfs9gz,31,1,"(This has a similar theme as part 1, but covers different content.)

One of the biggest issues with the sequel trilogy is what seems like the fall of a protagonist - especially after having built him up decades ago and the character has been in people's minds for about 40 years now. 

BUT Luke's ""regret"" of trying to assassinate Ben in his sleep could've been after Ben killed Mara Jade. It can be rationalized that in the sequel trilogy, Ben has already fought in the Yuuzhan Vong War, turned to the dark side, tried to seduce \*ahem\* ""Ben"", already killed off Mara Jade, already destroyed the Jedi temple, and now is at literal war with the new republic. 

Rey's character, however, could've only been better if Palpatine would've been re-introduced as a clone in the beginning of season 7 and as Rey's grandfather. Then Rey would've had more depth, purpose, and rationale for fighting against a seasoned force user like Ben. Otherwise, that was just lazy writing. 

The other missing kids from the Skywalker/Solo family could've been busy? Kinda like how they played with Ahsoka's character and rationalized how she wasn't in any of the movies. 

I feel the damage, but I feel like it can be worked with. It's not as dramatic as directly ignoring everything from the previous movies and canon, so I think there's still hope for reconciliation, especially with Filoni and Favreau manning the helm.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but Luke does experience a sort of exile from the new galactic government, albeit in the movies it's self imposed. Can't those two ideas be reconciled? 

Jacen/Ben Solo turn to the dark side and eventually become good in the last minute. - Is this really so far off? 

EU, from what I understand, doesn't have a descriptive death of Luke Skywalker. . .  the movies filled that in? (Could've been better, though.)

Lastly, all the events that weren't depicted in the movie and are great stories within the EU (Yuuzhan Vong War, Thrawn trilogy, rise and fall of Luke's Jedi Academy, the Skywalker and Solo families) weren't necessarily contradicting stories presented in the sequel trilogy, just complementary in a very rigid way. 

As in, just because it wasn't depicted in the movie, doesn't mean that those EU contents were necessarily contradicted.

I want to make a (preferrably animated) series or film about a younger Count Dooku. Showing his training by Yoda (maybe doing a scene where Yoda takes young Dooku to get his lightsaber crystal).  Dooku wrestles with the ideas of the Jedi and thinks many of them are good, but sees himself are more morally grey.  I am writing a parallel with Dooku and Anakin.  (I have a Yaddle cameo.  Giving us a little bit more about the Child's race.)  


Anakin, having one of the best jedi (Obi-Wan) as his mentor really helped him stay on the light side longer than he might have.  And Qui-Gon giving his life for Anakin to be able to be trained was self-less.  In my story, Dooku is taught by Yoda, and then receives a perfectly selfless apprentice, (Qui-Gon) which completely makes him see the good in everything.  Qui-Gon shows him that the Jedi ARE the better option.  


But then Qui-Gon dies at the end of Phantom Menace.  I want this to be the instigating force that causes Dooku to see the sith as the better option, gaining the moniker Darth Tyrannus.  The series or film would also show his choice of Ventress as a dark apprentice highlighting the difference between his reasons for choosing her and Qui-Gon.  


this could be a great way to add a layer of drama to the events of the prequel trilogy.  Christopher Lee's voice was enough to warrant all of this  :P

I have recently caught the Star Wars fever again (after RoS made me think I won't possible like the franchise again).

Theoretically I am also happy for suggestions for staples/the best of the best of Legends as long as the book doesn't contradict canon (consistency is important to me, lol) and is not much connected to other Legends stuff (like a part of a series).

But the entire time he was of this opinion, as we learn in TROS (which I think is a massive waste of an idea), he was already working on his contingency plan to build the Eternal Fleet.

So he rejected Vader and Thrawn's advice two times, but was already building the fleet anyway? If that's the case, why would they wait until the literal last moment to reveal this? There were hundreds of vessels in the fleet and I'm sure many of the Xystons with miniature Death Star beams could have been used the whole time.

Darth_Wrend249,1616967585,mfamzk,28,1,"So I've just finished re-watching the sequel trilogy, and one of the things that bugged me the most throughout all three films was the severe waste of potential for certain character developments. 

For me the most glaring examples are Phasma, the Knights of Ren, Rose and Jannah. There is so much potential to flesh these characters out in a meaningful way that would make their various confrontations on screen just that much more impactful. 

Then I thought that these films are created by one of the largest and most successful film companies on the planet and written by some of the most well respected and experienced film-makers in Hollywood. Surely they would know how to write characters and develop them meaningfully...they're not lacking experience of that.

Then it got me thinking about star wars in general and how it's not only a film franchise but a media franchise and they always want to create more books/comics/toys/videogames etc. 

With this in mind could the lack of character development have been intentional so that Disney/lucasfilms could tell their stories in other forms of media?

I’m just going to list my questions in and if anyone has the answers or knows of a wiki or website that does, please let me know! Thank you in advance!!

- Do the Children of the Watch always mandate that helmets are worn by their foundlings/those who join them, or just by those training to be Mandalorians?

- How long would the training take place for? Are there different sectors of training? (I know Din Djarin says he was trained in the “fighting corps” when he is talking about his training in the season 1 finale, so what if there are more?) 
Are they always required to fight if they choose to not become mercenaries or bounty hunters?

- Are the colors of Mandalorian armor significant to others in the culture? Do they get to choose the colors or is it mandated by what materials they bring in or have (beskar v durasteel)?

- Are the armourers the only ones who cast can the helmets/armor? When are Mandalorians even supposed to receive their helmets (i.e. when done training or when they finished growing)? 

- Do Mandalorians always have to donate a portion of their financial income to their tribes? Or can they receive training and then just leave the tribe (kinda a jerk move but I need to know)?

- Are all “official” Mandalorians required to make a trip or have a connection to Mandalore? It doesn’t seem so but they all seem to have either been on the planet at some point, want to go back and reclaim it, etc.

REVIEW: 

  - Story: 

I absolutely adored and love this story but when i reached the end, i found myself saying.... ""Is this it ? Really ?"" With all the loose ends, i desperately wanted more. I dont know if EA was rushing them, or if Respawn is just lazy but the fact that the Haxion Brood story ended the way it did and the aftermath was just tedious bounty hunter fights, is saddening. The Crime-world of Star Wars is rich with its own lore and would have made for an amazing quest.... Heck, even if it had to be a paid for DLC expansion. The story could have used a few more cameos from bigger star wars names aside from the Wookie Chief and Darth Vader (I did say spoilers in the title). Aside from these things I've mentioned, the story is done quite well and successfully creates a unique star wars story that is enjoyable from start to finish. 

   - Lore 

Fallen Order delves straight into the Star Wars Universe lore in a way no other game has ever achieved. There is so much to learn, from Flauna, to Insects and Creatures, People and Places, Planet History, and so much more. Practically at every turn you'll have something new to learn about. I was overtaken but how much effort went into incorporating proper lore into the world. That alone makes the game worth playing in my opinion. 

  - Exploration:

Where do i begin, at first, the exploration seems amazing because of the world desgin allowing you to immerse yourself into the worlds of Star Wars, but this quickly becomes quite the opposite. The game is not open world, its semi open world and thats a stretch.... The best comparison i can make is this; each planet is essentially 1 large dungeon, each jammed filled with monsters, encounters, secret passage ways, boss fights and more. They try to spice this up by locking certain areas with abilties you havent earned yet, enticing you to return as the story continues. Some people enjoy this, but it became very repetitive in my books and quite stale. Not to mention those god forsaken puzzles..........

   - Combat:

Then, i have a Love/Hate realtionship with combat system in this game. On one hand, the lightsaber looks gorgeous, you can deflect blaster bolts in a very satisfying manor, the parry system is intensely difficult at first but boy does it look cool and allows for some nice finish animations.... And then on the other hand, the lightsaber sounds like its lagging half the time, maybe more than that but i got used to it by the end of the game, dismembement only happens in some extent to bugs and creatures, all basic human enemies stay intact no matter what, and the force abilties you unlock leave more or less to be desired. On the plus and negative side, this game does a very good job capitalizing on people's phobias and creates very scary moments for the player that will make your heart skip a beat. 

   - Graphics: 

I honestly think im being kind with a 6/10 rating for this games graphics.... About a third of the cut scenes in the game would have delayed audio. It got so bad at some points, that Cal or Cere would say an entire sentence with no sound, then the audio would play after or right when there finishing... And that's only scratching the surface, faces are blurry/unfinished and its not by the games blur effect, the game stutters all over the place. Some textures wont fully form, and will be extremely low vs everything else around it thats high textured. Some enemies would spawn later than they should cause the game is trying to load their models and get it all set up. Aside from the cut scenes, and low texture issues, the game has amazing graphics when your just exploring, and taking it in. You'll be taken away by how great and awful somethings look.",StarWars,My Honest Jedi Fallen Order Review/Rating. (SPOILERS),3851,686,5.613702623906706
matuisgman,1616924568,meyd13,1,1,"So I had owned Force Unleashed one and two, along with most expansion stuff, so bought it for my x-360. But my slight obsessiveness kicked in, and I will need to follow a walkthrough to get all the holocrons. Its more about the fact I use to own it.

I find it a little nostalgic but I defiantly feel the old platform set up. As in the lack of level interactivity, because when trying to jump somewhere, modern games would likely catch you by way of garbing a ledge.

Had to compare it to Fallen Order, which is a better game of course. Especially when coming to level navigation, or more correctly getting to hidden spots. Though two things I think are better is Force Unleashed has a tad more force levitation opportunities and of course force lighting. 

However I was watching a YouTube channel, talking about game development. It had to do with limited assets in game worlds, so I think it comes down to lots of small cool things and a few big cool things. Of course graphics always is a big cool thing. 

I think if Force Unleashed now it would be mechanically a good game but its mechanics would likely be around actual force powers. Where Jedi Fallen order is more lightsaber fighting and level navigation. Though as game power increases selecting the cool stuff to do will matter less. 

Though I do think sometimes the focus a little too much on graphics in games, I mean the they are cool, but if dialing back a little allows more mechanics I would find it more fun.

Like the title says this is my idea of a perfect Star Wars game, that I would no doubt sink hundreds of hours into.

**Story:** I haven't come up with a specific story but how it would work would be similar to Old Republic. You will be able to choose different classes and each class will have their own storyline. I haven't decided what era I want to be in, but its gonna at least be sometime before the Rule of Two. The world and quest structure would be similar to Bethesda's RPG games. There can be different factions you can ally with or go against. If you choose to be a Jedi you wont be automatically hostile to the Sith's but you be very close to kill on sight, other way around if you are a Sith. Those are the only exceptions to faction alignment.

**Class Mechanics:** So how I would do the classes would be that each class would have their own skills, perks and storylines, but they won't have weapons or armor locked, such as in SWTOR. But lightsabers would specifically be used by Jedi's or Sith. That's the only locked weapon for me. But for example if you use a Jedi or Sith you can also use blasters if you wish.

**Combat:** This is one that excites me the most. I want a more immersive style of combat. So how it would work would be most blaster shots or lightsabers slashes would be one shot to enemies, but its also applied to you as well. But shots are body parts specific, for example if you are shot in the arm you aren't dead but you're injured and either movement, accuracy or if you're using a melee weapon your attacks will be affected, same goes with enemies. Obviously if you're or the enemy is shot in the head you or they are dead. Torso shots would have about an 80 percent fatality rate as well. It would also be in first or third person.

**Weapons and Armor:** Since most blaster shots are one shot, weapons won't have a damage meter. Instead they will have everything else including: accuracy, range, fire rate and cooling. Melee weapons will have durability and attack speed. Armors will work more efficiently than others, obviously. One such armor that would in the game would be Beskar, now Beskar would defend best against blaster shots and lightsaber attacks. It would also be the most rare and expensive armor to find. The more attacks you take the more damage the armor would take and eventually it would become useless to where you would die. The same goes for all the other armors in the game.

**Enemies and Difficulty:** So since I explained how the combat works, enemies difficulty wont be measured by damage but instead by their ""battle smarts"", I can't think of a word for what I'm trying to say. Enemies will generally try to aim at your head or torso but can miss obviously or if you move right maybe direct their blaster shots to an arm or leg if you can completely dodge away. Now being how the combat this game will be hard but not impossible, it will force to make you think more strategically before going into battle. If you are wearing full armor enemies may try to aim for weak spots, such as the neck or any exposed leg and arm joints. Same with fighting enemies. And example would be if you were to take a job to kill some Mandalorians, most likely they would have full beskar so your best bet would be to aim for weak spots or silently take them out.

**Music:** Star Wars.

**Visuals:** Nothing groundbreaking, but visually appealing.

**World and Exploration:** So this game would have a handful of systems to explore, with each system having a handful of planets. The map not being the entire galaxy but instead small enough to where it wouldn't kill the devs but also big enough to have a big open world to explore with many things to discover. Also the game for me could take place somewhere in the outer rim. How planet travel would work would be similar to No Man's Sky or Elite Dangerous, seamless flying down onto planets. Each planet will have a pretty large map to explore, with many small outposts along with some large cities, or planets like Nar Shaddaa. You can also get ships by either trading your current one or by doing the obvious and saving credits to buy one. Space battles would work how you would think, shields, heavy or light weaponry and by flight skill. If you disable a ship you can board and loot the ship. If you die either in a space battle or on ground you'll respawn on last save.

**General UI Features:** The game won't have a UI that looks like you piloting a ship but have the obvious stuff you would expect in a single player RPG. It will also have the quicksave feature along like the fallout games or skyrim.

So that's pretty much what the ideal Star Wars would be for me. It probably will never happen, at least to that scale, cause its a pretty daunting task to be honest. So tell me what you guys think. I probably missed a few things so point them out is necessary. If any of you have any questions or ideas I would be very open to hear them.

HelloLindseyHere,1616895958,mervqa,2,1,"I love this conversation in Episode VI more than any other in Star Wars. People tend to (ahem) underestimate the power of the Dark Side, in reference specifically to its hold on those who fell into its grasp. Anakin was slowly manipulated and groomed to be a Sith Lord for thirteen years by a man he trusted with all his heart, and was then trapped, seemingly forever, in his own mind, unable to break out. He genuinely believes that he is a lost cause, even though you can see that, since learning his son was alive, he's started wanting to be himself again. It was hate that gave Darth Vader the strength to take over Anakin Skywalker, and it was love that gave Anakin Skywalker the strength to come back. To return. And the return of the Jedi is the greatest story in all of Star Wars: it's the return of Anakin. (my favorite SW film is Rogue One though. fight me)

After loads of searching around, I managed to filter it to the Otoh Gunga. I'll never forget the underwater city bubbles from the game and it looks pretty much identical to the images from the films. When I put it all together it all makes sense with the aliens, strange planets etc.

# Lana

&amp;#x200B;

 For a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. The Jedi were the champions of the Republic. While they were feared by some, many saw them as heroes. One of those was a little Mirialan girl. Her name was Lana and she lived above her family’s cantina. The world she had always known was located on the fringes of the Republic. Thus, she never found anything interesting about it. That is, until the day when she met a kind stranger. Correction: until the moment she realized that the hooded stranger was carrying a flashy cylinder strapped to his belt.

Lana checked that her mother wasn’t watching her, walked around the counter and jumped onto the seat in front of the stranger. Her small feet didn’t even touch the floor. The hooded human, who was sipping a hot beverage, held his cup midair as his eyes focused on the little green girl.

“Are you a Jedi?” she whispered.

Even through the shadows cast on his face by the hood, Lana could see the man had a faint smile. He put down his cup and Lana could see it was filled with a non-alcoholic blue drink. He took off the hood and leaned forward, supporting his elbows on the table. “What makes you say that?” He whispered back.

Her eyes pointed to his belt under the table. The man unclipped his weapon and placed it on top of a table. Lana’s purple eyes widened at the sight of the mythical object.

“Is that real? A real light sword?”

The man chuckled softly and held the saber in his hands at her eye level. “This is called a *lightsaber*. It is indeed the weapon of a Jedi”.

“If I have one, can I become a Jedi? Can I protect people with one?” she asked, this time not bothering to lower her voice.

“A lightsaber isn’t what makes me a Jedi. And you certainly don’t need one of these to help other people”. He pointed at her chest. “Something tells me that your heart will take care of that for you”.

Suddenly, an older Mirialan woman showed up from behind the Jedi and picked the girl up. “Lana, what are you doing? You’re late for school” she turned to the man. Her eyes hovered over the lightsaber for a while before saying. “I’m sorry for that. She likes speaking to the clients”.

The man smiled and the woman suddenly felt calm and not at all worried about her daughter talking with the stranger. “It’s okay. She’s a clever girl”.

“That she is…” the mother said softly.

The man clipped his lightsaber back on his belt and went back to his drink while little Lana kept telling her mother that she didn’t want to go to school.

After yet another horrible day, Lana came back to the cantina excited to see the Jedi again. But he wasn’t there. Realizing that he probably had other things to do, she did not let her hope fade and decided to wait for the next morning. But the stranger wasn’t there. In fact, he never appeared again. Lana had so many questions about the Jedi and the light… sabers, but there was no one to answer her queries. No one knew enough about the mysterious Order. An elder from the town was the only one who was able to tell her what the Force was… an energy that connected everything in the Universe – from small grains of sand to entire galaxies. Even more curious about the Jedi, she decided to become one. While the other children played and had fun together, Lana learned to take refuge in her own mind, by the power of meditation. However, whenever she tried to use her mind to control a simple rock, it didn’t move. Not even an inch.

Lana, as time went by, shifted her interests to engineering. Maybe one could only become a Jedi after crafting a lightsaber! That’s what she set herself to do. She used several parts, new and old, to build her own lightsaber, but, even after being finished, it never worked. Disappointed, she hid the ‘lightsaber’ inside a drawer and tried to forget about it.

Not that she could ever forget meeting that stranger man, but she was able to, at least, move on with her life. Her studies in engineering gave her the possibility of doing something else other than working at her parent’s cantina.

Even though the Republic was at peace, from peacekeeping duty to rescue missions, there was still much to be done in the galaxy. With that in mind, she enlisted in the Republic Defense Coalition and was sent to the *Emissary*\-class cruiser *Third Horizon*, commanded by Admiral Pevel Kronara. With her service, she met many Jedi, not unlike the one she had met years ago, but different. She even visited the *Starlight Beacon* before its dedication - all was perfect. That is, until they were called to the Hetzal system. Until the Great Disaster.

\*

Several Republic and Jedi ships coming from and going to the *Third Horizon* swarmed the sky while the Longbeam she was in, the *Beholder*, helped with the evacuation. They were not talking about a city, but an entire planet of forty billion people who were at risk. There, everyone was needed: Jedi or not. Her ship, which had been designed to be operated by a crew of three and carry a maximum of twenty four passengers, was now filled with evacuees. Once the ship was full, the doors closed and the captain’s voice sounded throughout the vessel. They were returning to the *Horizon* before coming back to pick even more people. Meanwhile, in the engine, Lana pushed her way through the crowd to go from one panel to the other. Until then, the ship had performed admirably considering the strain she was being put under. As the *Beholder* lifted off the ground, she felt it’s every shiver and decided to risk inputting more power to the engines so that it could handle better the gravity. Technically, Lana knew what she was doing, but no one had ever prepared her for that. A quick glance at the two pilots reminded herself that she was not the only one. They were all part of one big effort. After all, they were all the Republic.

They were on their seventh run, but there was still much to be done. Taking one breath, she looked out of the window and saw all the other ships. Then they received the order to abandon the system. A large container of tibanna was headed toward the system’s star. If it indeed collided with the star, it would be the end of everything in the system. They had to leave with everyone they had already loaded into the *Horizon*’s hangar. As they docked into the *Emissary*\-class ship, one last Vector abandoned the *Horizon*. She would later come to understand that Avar Kriss would be the last hope for Hetzal.

At the end of the day, almost everyone had lived. Lana simply went to her quarters. She had never been ready to work with so many *if*s before, especially with billions of lives under stake. Although she was afraid of doing it again, Hetzal was not her last trial of fire nor the Republic’s. The Hyperspace lockdown put in place by Supreme Chancellor Soh and the Battle of Kur brought even more strain to the relations within the Republic. At least, after the defeat of the Nihil, she was able to go back home and visit her parents.

After a cheerful family dinner, she went back to her room where she recalled her moments from childhood. Unintentionally, she opened the drawer where she had hid her ‘lightsaber’. She sat on her bed and held it in her hands like the Jedi had held his so long ago. That was the first time she cried after Hetzal. Maybe if she had been a Jedi, she would have saved more people. She could have helped steer the tibanna container off its course, or she could have helped protect the people from the raiders trying to get their way off planet at all cost - even if they had to kill innocents for it. Maybe she could have done so much more.

*So much more*, the words lingered inside her head. She was about to throw the lightsaber against her wall when her mother entered the room.

“You used to love that when you were a kid. You’d say you were going to become the greatest Jedi ever”. She then saw Lana’s face and walked closer. “You’re upset?” she asked. It was more of a statement than a question.

Lana gestured to the saber. “I could have done more. If only I had been a Jedi, I could have done more”.

Her mother smiled tenderly. She got down to one knee to be at Lana’s eye level and put her hands on her daughter’s shoulder. “Do you think the Jedi are gods?”

“No, but they have the Force”.

“No”. Her mother corrected. She didn’t know much about the Force or the Jedi. Everything she knew, Lana had taught her, “They can *use* the Force. The Force is all around us. *You* told me that. You have the Force too – You just didn’t need to tap into it to help those people”.

“If I could use it, I could have done more”.

“Or you could have done nothing”. Lana’s eyes rose to meet her mother’s. “When you joined the RDC, you wanted to make the difference. I told you to stay here, but you wanted more. You wanted to *help*. That wasn’t the Force telling you what to do. That wasn’t the stranger telling you what to do. That was *you*. *You* made that choice. If it wasn’t for that, there would have been one less person helping at Hetzal, and by the stars, everyone knows how much difference a person makes in those situations”.

Lana looked once more at the lightsaber and recalled the stranger’s words. They sounded more like a whisper now: “*A lightsaber isn’t what makes me a Jedi. And you certainly don’t need one of these to help other people. Something tells me that your heart will take care of that for you*”. She smiled. The stranger, *her* stranger, had been right. Her heart had led her to the RDC.

She was not a Jedi. She would never be one. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t help other people. That didn’t mean she couldn’t aspire to be the best version of herself.",StarWars,Lara: A High Republic Fan Story,10215,1820,5.612637362637362
LordDeraj,1615974137,m6wpj9,13,1,"I’m just going to interpret how I think he would have been in Revenge of the Sith since only way I think they could have fixed in in the 2008 series is to have made a Jedi of the week to kill. My basic premise is that GG would have been that he would have taken the place of Count Dooku at the beginning. He’d over power Anakin and Obi Wan who’d only be saved by his ship taking massive damage and him making a tactical retreat. This would establish his threat status immediately while also saving Dooku for later.

Getting almost killed by GG would also make Anakin feel powerless as he couldn’t even beat this force-less cyborg so how’s he supposed to save Padme. Skipping ahead I think the second act should focus more on the Battle on Kashyyyk putting both Kenobi and Yoda there but having Kenobi trying to take out GG while being stalked by him Predator style. At the same time we have Anakin discover that Palpy is a Sith but he tells him that Dooku is on Mustafar with the Separatists. Desperate he goes there to end the war faces Dooku alone. 

At this moment the scene go back and forth between Anakin and Kenobi and their respective duels. GG is mocking Kenobi as though he’s trying to make him submit to the Dark Side like Dooku is doing with Anakin. Both win but Anakin then goes and slaughters the Separatists while Kenobi returns to Yoda. Order 66 happens and Kenobi kills Cody because I’m annoyed there was never anything done with him in Rebels or any extended material. Yoda goes to Coruscant while Kenobi goes to Mustafar and they play out the same. 

This is just off the top of my head so feel free to criticize or offer your own take on how GG would be if he stayed the threat.

Thorney979,1615951763,m6r464,6,1,"So I was looking for new games on my Switch and saw that the remastered ""Star Wars Episode One Racer"", and downloaded it immediately. It used to be one of my favorite games on the N64, and after a few minutes, I could see why. I honestly felt like I was instantly back in 2nd Grade again, feeling like a kid and having a blast zipping around the tracks with Anakin (yes, I know he's not the best racer, but that's who I always used as a kid). Sadly, 24 hours later, I had finished all the tracks and unlocked all of the racers. It's still fun to play, don't get me wrong, but I still wish there was more.

terriblehuman,1615929295,m6jmcx,7,1,"I see a lot of complaints from people about the character “Geode”, a character written by Claudia Gray. It’s almost exclusively criticized by people who never read Into the Dark. You can argue that making a character a rock is not creative, and you might have a point if the author were unable to write this character in a way that captures a reader’s interest. Fortunately, Geode was written by Claudia Gray, and she is the type of author who can make a rock interesting. Geode becomes a source of interest and amusement as the main character is unsure if Geode is actually a living being who is navigating the ship, or just a weird prank. Gray of course doesn’t give much away about his nature, and the main character continues to be confounded as Geode will just kind of show up places, despite not witnessing his movements.

sobes20,1615928363,m6j9bi,47,1,"After seeing countless ""Rey bad, prequels good"" memes, I was thinking about Rey as a character compared to Luke, Anakin, and other characters. I personally like her as a character and the sequels. This does not mean the movies are without fault (In fact, even though I love the original trilogy I do not think that they are flawless either).

I did a quick search of the subreddit, and there have already been plenty of threads devoted to Rey as a Mary Sue and similar type discussions. While I recognize this topic has already been discussed ad nauseum with people having very polarizing opinions on the subject, I did not participate in those threads so I was hoping to start a friendly dialogue anyway (or at least try) since not all of my points seem to have been made.

I will only discuss TFA Rey at this time since it is the only movie I really considered at any length. Also, I want to focus specifically on Rey without comparing her to Luke or Anakin (To be upfront, I admit that I do think that Rey's power and adeptness with the force is not all that different from Luke or Anakin).

Here are some critical facts:

* Rey is 19 years old at the beginning of TFA
* Rey is abandoned on Jakku when she is 5 years old
* Rey is alone on Jakku for 14 years, and is shown to be adept at fighting with a staff 
   * Assuming Rey starts learning how to fight as late as 10-12, that is 7-9 years of training (This is largely an assumption. Maybe it's talked about in a comic or something. Idk.)
* Kylo defeats Rey on Takodana (he uses the force to make her lose consciousness)
* Kylo recognizes that Rey is very strong in the force, but is just learning her powers (Considering we later find out that her father was Palpatine's clone, it makes sense for her to be very powerful with the force)
* Kylo tells Snoke about Rey's power, and Snoke tells Kylo to bring Rey to him
* Kylo kills Han 
* Chewie shoots Kylo
* Rey tries to shoot Kylo, but Kylo uses the force to paralyze her in place and then force pushes her into a tree knocking her out
* Kylo fights Finn
   * Finn lands a lucky blow on Kylo's arm
* Kylo defeats Finn, and Rey comes to
* Prior to fighting, Kylo tells Rey that she needs a teacher
* Kylo and Rey fight 
   * At first, Kylo is pushing Rey back
   * Rey starts attacking relentlessly (perhaps tapping into her anger and the dark side of the force) and injures Ren
* Snoke orders the First Order to retrieve Kylo, and says that it is time to complete Kylo's training

First, Rey's background is critical to understand why there is nothing unusual about her power. Rey was abandoned and has been alone on an unforgiving planet for 14 years. Her ability to fight and defend herself was crucial to her survival, and even a conservative estimate would give her 7-9 years of combat/fighting experience. This time alone is also critical to her knowledge of flying, ships, etc., but I don't want to focus on that and instead focus on her prowess to be a powerful Jedi.

Rey is clearly proficient with a staff, but you can't assume that she does not know how to fight with anything else. Just because she prefers a staff does not mean she cannot wield a sword. It could be a matter of preference. On top of her practical experience as a fighter, she is also clearly powerful with the force because she is a Palpatine. We have seen that you could be using the force without knowing that you are using the force.

Another critical aspect is that when she fights Kylo in the forest, Kylo is clearly injured and likely fatigued by using the force. He's shot with a bowcaster in the side so he is physically injured and then also likely using the force to keep going. He then expends even more force to paralyze Rey and make her go flying through the air. The physical injuries and fatigue allow Finn to land a blow on Kylo. So now Kylo has two physical injuries on top of fatiguing himself through force use.

It is at this point that he fights Rey. But he isn't fighting to kill Rey, which is hugely important. Kylo could have killed Rey, but he did not want to kill her. He was trying to subdue her so that he could train her, which he expressly tells hers prior to fighting. Then, when they begin to fight, Kylo has the upper hand at first. It is Rey closes her eyes and ""centers"" herself that she starts attacking Kylo relentlessly, and that's when she wounds Kylo. Arguably, she could have been tapping into her anger and the dark side in order to accomplish this feat.

Finally, when Snoke orders Kylo's retrieval, he says that he has to finish Kylo's training. Thus, Kylo is not a finished product either. Kylo, like Rey, has a lot of raw power, but he is far from a finished product.

Also, in a previous encounter when Kylo is not injured, easily defeats Rey.

This pretty definitely shows that Rey is not unusually powerful in the Star Wars universe, and is certainly not a Mary Sue.

Ezra becoming a selfess hero is cheap. we have already seen plenty of heroic Jedi, we have rarely seen a Jedi that is more a ""Rouge"" than a ""Paladin"" (in Dungeon and Dragons terms).

Ezra was at is best when he was a selfish, cynical, happy go lucky, street thief.

he was more interesting at the start of season 1, when he was a selfish and cynical thief that grow up in the streets of Lothal or during his ""Darkside phase"" in season 3.

Ezra becoming a selfless hero make his character boring and generic. we already have plenty of young and heroic jedi (Luke for exemple). there is no need for another one.

the best parts of Star Wars Rebels (Ahsoka vs Vader, Maul vs Obi-Wan, everything involving Thrawn, Kanan development) are not even focused on him. Ezra is simply a bystander, and interesting events happen araound him.

for me Star Wars Rebels should have been a direct sequel to Star Wars the Clone Wars, with Ahsoka as the main character.

we could have seen the continuation of her journey and how she become Fulcrum, how she helped creating the Rebellion, how she adapted to her new life in a galaxy ruled by the Empire, how she evaded the Imperial Inquisition.

Aliboron,1615887999,m65d4i,8,1,"My opinion is probably in the minority, but I think that Anakin was horribly overrated as a Force user.

There really isn't a lot of canon evidence that Anakin was actually any good at using the Force, unless you count the Clone Wars cartoons, but seriously, it's the movies that count. And if you mention the EU I will just shake my head and feel sorry for you, because no one wants to have a reasoned debate over the musings of a 3rd rate fantasy novelist cranking out Star Wars books at 4 am before the deadline just to pay their bills.

The main issue with Anakin's exploits is that he has almost no major victories against experienced Jedi/Sith under his belt, except against Dooku. Everything he's done which is supposed to be impressive happened off screen or against massively inferior competition. He's the Kimbo Slice or Greg Oden of Star Wars. A lot of hype but no delivery. So the question in these situations is always if maybe it was just unfortunate circumstance, like that guy you play pick up hoops that misses his first 10 shots and then blames it on his sore elbow. Every week. Or if he just wasn't that good to begin with.

On the minus side he:

Lost his right hand to Dooku and got knocked out, after trying to double-saber.
Got captured on Geonosis, and nearly executed until saved by Windu.
Lost both of his legs in a duel against Obi-Wan, although in Anakin's defense he was at the massive disadvantage of being slightly lower. In a sword fight where they could both see each other clearly. Anakin ended the fight burning next to a pool of lava.
Got his spaceship shot up by Han Solo. Nice Force reflexes.
Lost his right hand again, this time to Luke, a freshly minted Jedi Knight.
But it's not all bad. Let's look at Anakin's achievements.

Won a local podrace at age 9.
Got the high score on the midichlorian test.
Destroyed a droid control ship, after being shot down and crashing inside the ship, and discovering the proton torpedo button.
Slaughtered a village full of Sandpeople.
Managed to not get eaten for 5 minutes in the Geonosian execution ring, facing off against some dangerous looking animals.
Defeated Count Dooku one-on-one.
Did whatever was mentioned in all that background filler conversation with Obi-Wan.
Bushwhacked Mace Windu.
Killed a lot of six year-olds at the Jedi Academy.
Killed a room full of unarmed Trade Federation bureaucrats.
Terrorized a princess.
Killed Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan threw the fight.
De-handed Luke, a Force neophyte with a whole six weeks of training. But it took him like 10 minutes and he still took a shot to the arm.
Defeated Palpatine, by using such advanced Force techniques as grabbing him and throwing him down a conveniently placed giant hole. Again, Anakin wins by blindsiding and betraying his otherwise occupied opponent, and his primary strength here is the ability to take a bolt of Force lightning to the face and keep walking.
So, to me this list doesn't scream ""most powerful Jedi ever"". Nothing other than the midichlorian count points in that direction. What I see is an opportunistic backstabber with a penchant for bullying non-Force users and getting de-limbed.

As the Battle of Exegol continues, it quickly becomes clear that the Final Order is losing. In the midst of it all, Allegiant General Enric Pryde is contacted by Palpatine, who orders him to have the many Xyston-class Star Destroyers clear a space for a “surprise” Palpatine has planned. Pryde obeys.

The Civilian fleet begins to notice that the star destroyers are creating a hole in their formation, and a rather large one. Poe wonders what they’re doing, then gets an alert from Lando that something is coming out of hyperspace. Something big.

The shot then focuses on the hole in the formation, lingering on it for a few seconds. Then, barreling through Exegol's atmosphere, a huge, black Super Star Destroyer emerges, perfectly filling in the hole in the formation. Shortly after, a bright green streak of light runs across its horizontal vertices, culminating up front of the triangular behemoth. A superlaser blast erupts from the craft, instantly destroying one of the Mon Calamari ships in the civilian fleet.

I have two weeks off of work and I want to for the first time go through the entire timeline pretty much non stop. I’ve been reading into the various suggestions online and wanted to go ahead and post here. Are there certain cut-off points anyone recommends I should stop at to get the best experience as far as stopping during the shows? (i.e. clone wars) &gt;That was a common reoccurring suggestion I saw online but it varied based on the source. Just curious what this sub had to offer by way of opinion. 

I’d like to get a real chronological viewing experience. I know everyone’s seen the photo, but it’s attached. Growing up I was always a fan. The Mandalorian just completely reignited that fanfare within me though and I am ready for the full experience. I should also say, I’ve actually never watched the animated series all the way through. So, I’m in for a treat.

Anyway, if Sheev Palpatine ""encouraged"" Shmi Skywalker's pregnancy (as told in the Darth Vader Comics and in a scene that was cut from Episode III), that makes Ben Solo and Rey quasi kissing cousins.  I guess that would help explain their additional weird Force ""link"" and ""dyad"" through Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, Rey's unexplained connection to Anakin's lightsaber in Episode VII, and how Rey was so much more naturally powerful than Ben Solo besides bad story development and bad movie development (Rey was Palpatine's granddaughter, and Ben would've been his quasi great-grandson, thus he was further removed from Palpatine on the generational plane).

I might be misinterpreting the scene, but it kinda fits with what I've seen of other Wookie behaviors - for all the growling and roaring, they can be very sensitive sometimes.

Also, just after the attack, Chewbacca stops to let Yoda climb onto him before running off. I can't imagine Wookies just randomly let people ride them. Again, shows a kind of sensitivity that I thought was sweet.",StarWars,Wookies can really warm your heart sometimes...,784,141,5.560283687943262

I will never understand the hate TLJ gets. I think it’s the best of the new trilogy. Outside of the weird casino sequence with Finn and Rose, Snoke’s anticlimactic death, and Leia’s space floating (I laugh out loud every time) I thought it was great. 

Don’t see why nobody believes Luke Skywalker is incapable of temporarily betraying his teenage idealistic morals. He explains it’s due to his hubris as “a legend” that made him fail Ben and reject the force. I don’t see why fans see it as betraying his character. Would it honestly be better if Luke never strayed from the happy-go-lucky “come on gang let’s band together and fight via the power of friendship”? A character losing him/herself and regaining their path IS character development. I’d be much more bored if we found out Luke was the same person he was decades ago. 

Further TLJ has some awesome canonical story telling. The sequence where Luke/Rey describes the force and how it is everything around them is the amazing to me. The force is an abstract concept and that scene is the best job the whole series has ever done in helping the viewer visualize it. 

I also love the final bit where Luke was omnisciently creating a “ghost” of himself. Tbh before then I feel like we the viewer never got to see Luke as the great Jedi/force master he is supposed to be. This scene is the one time where we can see Luke is truly a special force-wielder. 

All in all I think it’s at worst an average SW films. I like it much more than Episodes 1-3. The entire plot of 7-9 is messy but it’s still good. It’s hard for us to escape from our first love (OT) as many of us were fans of the series long before the Disney era came out.",StarWars,Thoughts on TLJ,1792,328,5.463414634146342

Moonx713,1615863667,m5zgrj,5,1,"I don't know if this post is allowed, but I realized lately that a lot of people love Star Wars, but don't know a whole lot about specific aspects. If people want to ask questions, I think it would be cool if there was a thread where people could share Star Wars lore. 

For example, I was talking with some people on r/PrequelMemes, and noticed that a lot of people don't know about the different forms of lightsaber combat, so I thought I'd drop a short summary. 

 Form 1 is Shii-cho, also known as Way of the Sarlacc. It’s the basic form, learned by younglings, focusing on several key points of contact. 

Form 2, Makashi, is used most often on lightsaber on lightsaber combat. Users position their feet in a line, and often use curved sabers for better balance. Makashi grips are often farther down the hilt for more maneuverability and leverage. Dooku is the most obvious and well-known practitioner of this form. 

Soresu is form 3, most notably used by Obi-wan Kenobi. It focuses on defense, although makes it harder to go on the offensive. His mixed style of his master’s Ataru and Soresu (which he studied after Qui-gon’s death upon learning of one of the key weaknesses of Ataru that got his master killed) helps strengthen his lightsaber combat. More Jedi started using Soresu during the wars, to help create an impenetrable defense. 

Ataru (most obviously used by Qui-gon, and of course, Yoda) is form 4, and uses a lot of force acrobatics. It’s been favored by smaller creatures after Yoda’s prowess was evident, but larger species are still practitioners of the form. 

Form 5 includes two different aspects, Djem so and Shien. Djem so is most notably used by Anakin Skywalker. This was created by form 3 users who wanted a better opportunity to attack, so it utilizes a counter-attack strategy. Shein is based upon blaster bolt deflection back at their owners.

Form 6 is Niman, and it’s basically a mix of techniques from most of the forms. I'm fairly sure Sheev Palpatine is one of the practitioners of this form.

Form 7 is Juyo (which Vaapad is a variant of, created by Master Windu). It’s a Sith form that focuses on using emotion to drive combat, and is incredibly rarely practiced by Jedi, if at all. It's most often only practiced by few specific masters that are selected to learn it, and Jedi need permission to learn this form.  Vaapad is different than the typical Juyo mostly because of which emotions are used to fuel the combat. Juyo feeds off of hate, anger, and fear, while Vaapad uses those same emotions but also encourages an inner balance. I don’t know a whole lot about Juyo, but Vaapad is supposed to be a really unpredictable form, and I’ve always found it interesting. 

Other such notable saber styles are Jar'Kai, which is two saber fighting, and the reverse grip, both used by Ashoka Tano. Some force-wielders don't use lightsabers at all, but have other weapons such as a force-enhanced staff. Other Jedi use variations from the typical lightsaber, represented by the double-bladed lightsabers wielded by the temple guard, Yoda's Shoto (a smaller lightsaber used in two-weapon fighting as a secondary weapon, or for smaller Jedi as a primary one), lightwhips, lightclubs (I swear if autocorrect changes this to nightclubs one more time, I'm going to go insane), among other obvious variations such as the curved-hilt lightsaber. 

Anyways, if anyone else wants to share their Star Wars lore, I'd love to learn more about the universe. Actually, if people know more about Sith Lords such as Darth Bane and Revan, or where I can find more information on them, it would be really cool to learn more about that aspect of Star Wars.",StarWars,A discussion for Star Wars lore that is well known by some but obscure to others,3674,634,5.794952681388013

With the Skywalker Saga over, it's time for Star Wars to find new challenges, ideas, and heroes who have no famous lineage, but rather stand on their own and make their own names.
* No more superweapons. Their expensive, and they inevitably get destroyed. The new villains need powers or tech that's considered standard to them, yet can cause as much destruction as a superweapon. Just to show how dangerous they are.
* New Planets, or planets that are mentioned but not seen yet, or planets that only got one appearance outside the movies. The galaxy needs to expand, and more must be seen to create new stories and characters. I'd love to see more of Malastare, or travel to Ithor.
* Have a new mundane starter job for our new hero or heroine. Star Wars heroes often begin with lowly jobs, and since I don't want the next hero to have any lineage or prophecy to them, they might have the lowest start. Ideal jobs could be technician, janitor, office worker, hospital caretaker, maybe their even a struggling single parent. That would be a new taste in Star Wars heroes. But it's not lineage or prophecy that gets them on their way, it's their character and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
* New vibes for the villains. Our new villains need different evil vibes to distinguish them from the Sith, Mandolorians, CIS, Empire, or First Order. Me personally, I think the Soviet Union would be a good inspiration.
* A VERY different and liberal Jedi Order. If Rey and others founded a new Order, it's essential that they not repeat the mistakes of the Old Order or Luke's Order. If I could have my way, they'd adopt the philosophies of Qui-Jon Jinn, they bend to the will of the Force, rather then make the Force bend to their will. They also would not be as active in war.
* If the Grysk are our new villains, like the Yuuzhan Vong, there needs to be some good Grysk. 
* If necessary, old planets from the past 3 trilogies can be brought back, but this time for new roles.
* Have a villain who acts more like a fundamentalist knight templar rather then a typical Dark Lord. This is a villain who not only thinks he's doing good and has some understandable motives, but also has the support of the common folk, or can sway common folk to his side very easily.

Wizzy_Boi,1615836414,m5soc5,57,1,"I know they've been out for awhile, but I recently had a friend who hadn't seen any Star Wars movies other than TFA, so we've been slowly watching them when we can. I was having some discussions with some of my friends as to which sequel is the best, and I wanted to hear more opinions on Reddit. 

First off, I'd like to say that I enjoy TLJ and loathe TRoS. I've noticed that a lot of people hate TLJ because ""it doesn't setup for TRoS"", but TLJ was actually planning on a different script for Episode 9. So I honestly feel that is the fault of TRoS more than anything. 

I also get that a lot of people are upset about Luke's character in TLJ, but I think that it makes sense due to the buildup of TFA. When watching TFA, I was thinking, *Why is Luke not showing up to help with the First Order? They just obliterated billions of people, and Luke didn't sense all that death?* The only explanation I could think of for Luke not appearing in TFA is because he's disconnected himself from the Force or he's busy doing something more important (what would be more important than saving billions of people, I don't know).

I guess I could go on to express my feelings of TRoS, but I guess I'll leave it there. I suppose this post is more about my defense of TLJ, but oh well.",StarWars,Thoughts on the Sequels,1274,244,5.221311475409836

LorentzCoffin,1615703387,m4prmh,9,1,"Hey guys I’ve got a question about a theory. What do you all think of this?

During the Clone Wars a recurring point of political contention is the increasing troop numbers and runaway military expenditure as well as deregulation of the banks to “pay” for the war effort, to which Padame and Bail Organa are strictly opposed, time and again arguing the senate support seeking a peaceful resolution with the immediate goal of drawing down troop numbers and cutting military costs. Each time they are foiled by Palpatine and his minions from a terror bombing of a power station on Courascent to the political assassination of key members of their political faction. The spending and reckless lending sky rockets by the end of the Clone Wars setting up an economic crash on a galactic scale.

The only thing preventing this crash from destroying the nascent First Galactic Empire is the garrison of Clone troops, then Stormtroopers, effectively holding a gun to the head of every planet, this either reduced the impending collapse from the end of the war or nullified it because the first planetary government to say they have no money or that their money is effectively worthless will have a snap election by blaster and be replaced by a government who won’t say that. This thereby ushers in an era of false prosperity in which, despite having no real money the Empire is able to continue spending recklessly, dumping resources into the Death Star projects and enriching the lives of military, political, and business elites who are more than happy to court the Emperor’s favor by any means necessary. Including outlandish ship designs and doctrines designed to reinforce the prosperity through fear approach.

As a result with the fall of the Empire the much delayed economic crash destroys the galactic economy since there is no one to enforce prosperity at the barrel of a blaster, except the Imperial Remnants who are still severely impacted but fair much better than the New Republic. As a result of the crash the New Republic is forced to retire most of their fleet though Mon Mothma attempts to paint this as a pacifist gesture. Furthermore enforcement of the New Republic’s territorial claims is almost impossible, being left to anyone willing to tie themselves to the fledgling republic including rebel war criminals, bounty hunters, and really anyone with a gun tbh. During this time corruption outside its immediate sphere of influence is rampant and imperial remnant forces stake many claims in New Republic territory. Only after 30 years is the New Republic able to repair its economy and build a navy able to enforce it’s territorial claims but with fiscal conservatives wielding the economic crash that resulted from the Old Republic and Empire’s runaway military spending as a big bat which they use to knock military expenditure legislation out of the senate, financing mass production is all but impossible. 

This forces the New Republic to divide its fleet. The New Republic sends small flotillas to its borders to push out the various imperial remnant factions and enforce its claims while keeping the bulk of it’s fleet at anchor in the Hosnian system since the imperial remnants were able to maintain and (in the case of the First Order) expand their fleets posing a dire threat to the New Republic should that fleet leave anchor. So as a means of destabilizing their...would it be geopolitical? We’re not talking about one planet here...galactopolitical opponents and effectively buying time for the New Republican Navy to catch up to the imperial remnant navies, Leia proposes the creation and funding of the Resistance with the goal of destabilizing or destroying the imperial remnant factions on the cheap. 

Which brings us to the 7th movie where they fail miserably and the New Republic and its fleet get blown up (even though SK base could have just sucked up the star of the Hosnian system with similar effect and we could’ve gotten to watch a really big and cool space battle).",StarWars,A quick question,4007,671,5.971684053651267

**Star Wars: Destroyer** \- 4 episodes mini-series with a dark tone (I'm picturing the cinematographer of HBO's Chernobyl).

The Imperial Star Destroyer Resolution has been forced to retreat over and over again and morale is low. Captain Jeffrey Wright (I don't have names for the characters) is considering if the Imperial cause is still worth it, and just wants to do well for his crew. First Officer Michael Fassbender had a sister on the Death Star and is more committed than ever to the war. 

They then receive a secret transmission for a top secret mission. They are to travel to this isolated Star System where a rebel ship is stranded and destroy it. They are to leave no survivors. They are to pick up a elite squad of Death Troopers who have been particularly trained to deal with this specific and undisclosed threat. The head of the squadron is lieutenant Wes Chatham (Amos from the Expanse) and tensions grow between his men and the Stormtrooper garrison within the ship. 

As tensions escalate and morale drops, will the Resolution even reach its destination in one piece? And who exactly is this rebel they have been tasked with killing?",StarWars,Anyone has a Star Wars spin-off series written in their head? I have Star Wars: Destroyer.,1501,262,5.729007633587786
zacharyarons,1615686191,m4kxck,16,1,"As every Star Wars fan knows, ever since his inception in Return of the Jedi, Palpatine has always been depicted as the ultimate evil. A tyrannical dictator who rules the galaxy with an iron fist, as well as a powerful sorcerer with supreme mastery over the dark side of the force. The prequels made no efforts in trying to make us sympathize with him, instead depicting him as a Machiavellian mastermind who started a war in order to  manipulate the galaxy into giving him absolute power under the guise of claiming that the republic needs a authoritarian leader in order to steer it through troubled times. He turned the whole galaxy against the Jedi, and turned Anakin to the dark side by claiming that only he can save his wife. He is a monster that caused decades of misery and untold suffering and death simply due to his selfish desire for power. And there hasn't been a single material set in the Star Wars Universe that has ever tried to portray him with redeeming or sympathetic qualities.

Yet Star Wars Underworld, a canceled live action TV series that was supposed to set between ROTS and A New Hope, would've changed all that. Former Lucasarts employee Cory Balrog (He's the one who directed the God of War series) one time revealed that he read a script at Skywalker Ranch for the Scrapped TV series featuring a more humanized Palpatine, in this script, he would have been depicted as a sympathetic figure who was wronged by a Heartless female gangster, perhaps taking place in Palpatine's past having it be the event that set him down the path of darkness. Sadly the exact details of what the woman did to him has not been revealed but Balrog claimed that it almost brought him to tears when he read it.

Hearing about this online makes me wonder? How would fans react if the storyline presented in the script was ever fully realized? I honestly believe it would have been a very controversial decision. Some might have welcomed it, happy that Palpatine, when before was depicted as a somewhat generic pure evil villain, was finally given some much needed depth. Others would've probably be angry at how the show choose to depict Palpatine, for they believe that making him sympathetic would be against the very idea of what the character is supposed to be. Maybe he is better off remaining the ultimate evil, for we already have Darth Vader for a more nuanced, tragic villain.

How would you feel about a more humanized, sympathetic take on the infamous Sith Lord? Would it be something you would be interested in seeing such a depiction? Or did Star Wars dodge a bullet by canceling Underworld?

D-GenerationMatt505,1615672638,m4ghgb,47,2,"*(Note: This is not counting the Clone Wars movies)*

**11. Rise of Skywalker:** A plot hole ridden messy film, we're somehow meant to believe Palpatine returned and was conducting all of this behind the scenes. This film alone single handedly destroyed all of Star Wars by literally giving Anakin Skywalker's story to Rey (the biggest mary sue in all of cinema) who is somehow Palpatines granddaughter it's also an insult to the franchise that Anakin wasn't featured in the film at all. Don't watch this one (or any of the sequel trilogy).

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Last Jedi:** Terrible writing, the film makes no sense and the characters are awful, Kylo Ren our new ""badass"" ""Villain"" is just a whiny bitch, hardly any character development. And again this film like the entire sequel trilogy butchers the Skywalker story as Rey is left as the ""Last Jedi"" once Luke Skywalker dies. Don't watch this one (or any of the sequel trilogy).

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Force Awakens:** The entire film is just a shitty rehash of A New Hope, its all just fan service and nothing more and nothing less, really its just fan fiction with one good character that being Finn. Back in 2015 when this film came out I was excited as hell but left with an unmatchable level of disappointment. The biggest issue is the one which its two even worse sequels suffers from as well (I'll leave you to figure that one out). Don't watch this one (or any of the sequel trilogy).

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Phantom Menace:** There are no character traits in this movie, no clear protagonist, the dialogue is very rough, its incredibly boring with an overly confusing plot which is all about politics when Star Wars is meant to be for kids (what kind of kid wants to watch a movie about boring old politics) and if you take this film out of the prequel trilogy it still changes nothing. However it has a badass soundtrack and a really really really good final battle which is my favorite lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars but other than that its a shitty film. Not even gonna mention you know him. I remember being so excited to go and see this as an 11 year old and actually liking it up until my early teen years.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Attack of the Clones:** What can I say about this which hasn't already been said, the worst dialogue in all of the films and poor acting. The Obi Wan storyline is ok but Count Dooku is not a threatening character at all which is a shame since Christopher Lee's acting is top notch. Palpatine's plan makes no sense and his assassination attempts on Padme just randomly stop just so Anakin &amp; Padme can have an awful romance storyline where they spit bad cringey dialogue and seeing Yoda in the end with a lightsaber saddens me because it goes against his entire character and the battle between Dooku v Anakin/Obi Wan/Yoda is awful however the Geonosian arena battle is pretty good. This film also made improvements over its predecessor in that it features a thing called character traits and also has less of the worst character in the prequel trilogy (not gonna mention his name). Bad film nonetheless. Even when it came out I didn't like it since I was 14 and had matured.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Solo A Star Wars Story:** Now we're getting into the good films and its refreshing since talking about the crap ones was making me upset. I really love seeing the backstory of my favorite character in the entire franchise Han Solo. Its just a fun heist movie movie and I had a good time watching it but I do get why some people might not like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Return of the Jedi:** Not as as good as episode's 4/5 but still a great film and leaves the trilogy off at a satisfying conclusion. It has my personal favorite duel from the original 3 films in the end with Vader v Luke and then Vader's redemption, of course there is some bad such as Hans personality basically being deleted, and all the scenes with the Ewoks but other than that one of the better threequels you will find..

&amp;#x200B;

**4. A New Hope:** Prior to 1977 a film of this kind simply didn't exist and while I wasn't alive for it I can remember the first time I watched Star Wars when I was about 4 or 5 this was before Phantom Menace mind you, I can remember being in love and for years this was what sparked mine and pretty much everyone's obsession with Star Wars. Too bad this film has been butchered by the constant changing of the special editions.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Rogue One:** I went into this film thinking it would suck as I really hated Force Awakens but then it started, it introduced us to a new crew of great characters, so much emotion behind it especially since you already know from the get go that all of these characters will end up dead and the whole time you are dreading it. It has a great story that ties into A New Hope perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Empire Strikes Back:** This was my favorite until my number 1 came along. Definitely the perfect example on how to make a sequel and a darker one too. It builds upon everything established in A New Hope and introduces new stuff, perfect world building and has possibly the biggest reveal in all of cinema. I was so tempted to put this one at no. 1 but...

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Revenge of the Sith:** I must be one of the few people who never actually hated this film, I was 17 when this came out and it has been my favorite since 2005. Definitely the darkest of all the Star Wars films, the most emotional one, the biggest upgrade out of any sequel I've ever seen (since its two predecessors are garbage), we finally get to see the Clone Wars, Anakin's darkside turn and how everything came to be how it is in the later films, however its not perfect as it still has some pretty bad dialogue, too much CGI (even if its really good cg), the way Yoda &amp; Obi Wan just give up is not very convincing and the film doesn't have a good sense of how much time has passed (granted most of the films don't) and the fight between Yoda &amp; the Emperor is just....no. The awesome final battle between Obi Wan &amp; Anakin has definitely the most emotion behind it out of any battle in all of Star Wars and the scene of where Anakin burns still brings me to tears. Never hated this one, and this one has always been my favorite. When you finish the nightmare of Eps 1 &amp; 2 you will find the threequel is a definite upgrade and a big one of that.

DragonBat362,1615672140,m4gbay,21,0,"The stakes were completely different. 

Obi-Wan and Yoda went into hiding because they didn’t really have any other choice. When the Jedi Order fell in 19BBY, the Empire was already in control over most of the Galaxy (thanks to the clones) and the Rebel Alliance wouldn’t be formed until only a few years prior to ANH (2BBY going by The Force Unleashed in Legends continuity). For those 17 years, the only active rebels were small uprisings and rebellions on local planets (which the clone journalist in Battlefront 2 implied was easy work for the Empire). The Imperial Senate was basically a joke, with most senators either loyal to or too afraid of the Empire to do anything. Most of the Galaxy’s population either resented the Jedi for the Clone Wars and/or were too afraid to do anything either. The few allies the Jedi still had (Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Garm Bel Iblis) were being watched under the Empire’s microscope and had to be extremely careful to not give the Empire an excuse to permanently silence them. Just a mere rumor or suspicion that the two were working with or in contact with the senators would have painted giant targets on all their heads. 

Not to mention Vader spent all that time hunting down any and all Jedi survivors and the two were extremely high on the Empire’s wanted list. Yoda’s species was so rare that the mere mention of a “little green man” on any planet would draw in the Empire (TFU2’s databank revealed that they had an ever-increasing bounty on him), so he had to go into seclusion. Obi-Wan had to watch over Luke and keep him safe from both the Empire and the dangers of Tatooine, since he knew Luke would one day need to learn the ways of the Force. As far as he knew, he and Yoda were the last of the Jedi and they had to preserve it.

Now compare that to Luke’s reason. He basically had EVERY reason to stay in the game! Yes, his Jedi Order was dead, but the New Republic was in power, Snoke and the First Order were in hiding, and he was still regarded as a war hero and a legend. Even with no other Jedi, he would have been a huge benefit to the New Republic and the Resistance due to his powers, his tactical (not to mention piloting) skills, and his reputation. I mean, Lando was able to rally the Galaxy to fight a fleet of Death Stars, so imagine what Luke could have done *much* earlier! Plus, unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, he *had* friends and family who were still alive and could have benefited from him being there! Not to mention, he had access to info in his sacred Jedi texts that would have come in handy *long* before TROS! He had every reason to come out of hiding before the events of TLJ, but he didn’t.

Honestly, thinking back on it, I realize just how easy Snoke and the First Order had it when compared to Palpatine and the Empire.

As for physical evidence, the droid presents Rey with something it recovered from the fallen academy, a lightsaber meant as a special gift that her best friend had built for her, only for him to have been killed that night. This, along with everything else, further motivates Rey to find and reunite with the other students, an adventure that takes her across the galaxy where she soon discovers her best friend is very well alive but there’s something else...He’s Kylo Ren.

TheMastersSkywalker,1615605997,m3y3hn,0,1,"In the GFFA space is much like an ocean with nebulas acting as reefs hiding mysterious creatures, asteroids acting as homes to mynocks and exogorths and   home to monsters of the deep. 

The GFFA is home to an interesting and diverse number of interstellar fauna and creatures that would easily fit under the kaiju tag in any holodrama. So today lets take a look at some of the kaiju in the New EU!

With 25 Kaiju and growing (and this is without the base Exogorth, Sarlaac, Krayt Dragon, or Rancor) I'm only really going to talk about 12 in depth before mentioning those who don't have that much of a background other than being big, scary, and more often than not very angry.

So the first one is the first kaiju to appear in the NEU was a [large glowing winged humanoid creature](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_Cr%C3%A8che_creature) that lived on the planet of Ovanis. For centuries the creatures egg was worshiped by a cult on the planet until a year before the the Hosnian Cataclysim when the egg hatched and attacked those around it. A black version of the same species soon appeared and the [two creatures fought in the air](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/84/Ovanis_saviours_fight.png/revision/latest?cb=20161114073745) with both fists and energy beams projected from their mouths.

The second kaiju to appear in the NEU may have possibly been the [flying whale ships](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Whale-ship) that were large enough to house entire skyscrapers on their backs and transport people through hyperspace. Darth Vader even used the giant creatures to assault his own super star destroyer when Cylo had taken control of it.

In fact Vader has encountered a number of kaiju in his service of his master. The planet of Cianap had been destroyed by a monster known as [Ender](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ender), a huge 20 story monster which a very shark like body and arrow like head. Vader was able to defeat the monster after a long and hard fought battle. 

More recently Vader had a run in with an [unkown squid like creature](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_creature_\(Red_Honeycomb_Zone\)) on his journey to Exegol. Possessing a giant eye over a vertical chasm of teeth the unknown creature acts as the guardian of the path to the lost sith planet attacking with its dozen limbs as well as through the force.

It is possible this creature could be of some relation to the [Summa-Verminoth](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Summa-verminoth), a giant tentacled creature that lives in the gravity wells of the malestrom around Kessel. Much like a stellar version of the sarlacc this monster grabs on to passing ships and pulls them down into the gravity well where it devoured its catch

Not all kaiju found in the depths of space were dangerous to ships or out to make of meal of any passerby. Some like the [interdimensional jelly fish](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/h3IqI8XsMcAfCkAPrcTFQb-30owgrkr803Y1FrrO83H1sgPSblpQ37JeuSAFs01YAJR83pB24FGh=s1600) near the Dragon Run or the [large space crab](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_creature_\(Kankalo_Belt_Containment_Zone\))  in the Kankalo Belt Containment Zone were only dangerous to those who invaded their home territory. And some like the purgill that [could grow up to a third the size of a Imperial Star Destroyer](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/011/005/516/4k/luke-harrington-purrgilultraava-06001-2.jpg?1527369988) or the [neebray](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Neebray) which had an average wingspan longer than the length of a Star Destroyer could actually be helpful to travelers. 

Some creatures were even mistaken for celestial bodies like the giant Kakran that was confused for a planet called [K43](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/K43) because of the shell created around it while it slept

Back on the ground the planets of the GFFA were also home to a number of larger creatures capable of great destruction and held in equal parts fear and awe of those who lived with them and occasionally used for as mounts for the native people such as the [hammer-headed beasts of Carnelion IV](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hammer-headed_beast) or as a source of their power and magic such as the ancient and powerful [Sleeper](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sleeper) which slumbered in the waters under Mother Talzin's coven and that produced the ichor the witches used to enhance their magics.

The primative R'ora, a race of fish-like aliens with sharp features, shark like teeth, and a hunger for flesh, used the gigantic [Tsw'ell](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tsw%27ells) to attack and destroy the settelments of the other species that had moved to Luporoa. As the sea levels rose it allowed the giant tentacled monsters with pink skin, numerous tentacles, sharp teeth, and two eyes. to march further and further inland. 

Not everything that came from the sea was out to attack unfortunate sailors or those who decided to take a short cut through a planets core. On Castilon a species of large green six eyed creatures that looked like a mix between a whale and a octopus were known to be peaceful when left along. The [Rokkna](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rokkna) were able to grow up to over 220 meters in length. 

High above the oceans the clear air was also home to its own set of kaiju. Creatures that could grow larger than even the [thranta](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thranta) of Alderaan or the [Beldon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Beldon) of Bespin. 

On Dathomir large winged bats known as [chirodactyl](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chirodactyl) were notorous among the people of Dathomir for attacking unwary travelers. Liking to live in dark caves the chirodactyl was known to drop its prey from great heights to make sure it was dead before eating it. 

On Celsor 3 a large air manta known as a [jakoosk](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jakoosk) were occasionally hunted for their meat. The jakoosk were a species of large creatures capable of flying and burrowing under snow native to the ice moon Celsor 3. They had thick gray skin and large mouths filled with large teeth that made hunting them even in starfighters very dangerous.

On Kashyyk however the skies are much friendlier. The [shyyyo bird](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shyyyo_bird) was a rare species of massive blue-blooded bird native to the planet Kashyyyk. Sightings of shyyyo birds were extremely rare, and the creatures were once thought to be legends.Shyyyo birds were capable of gliding significant distances while using little energy due to their body shape and feathers. This efficiency meant that the average adult Shyyyo only needed to leave its nest to hunt once per week.

The surface worlds were also not short on their share of oversized creatures. Larger than the well known rancor favored by the witches of dathomir and Hut crime lords the [jungle rancor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_rancor) had clearly defined shells and proportions resembling that of a turtle, with larger heads relative to the rest of their bodies. Orange and gray spines that ran along their bodies. Their unique physiology imbued them with greater speed and a keener sense of smell than other rancor subspecies.

Just like the jungle rancors are cousins to the better known dathomir rancor the sarlacc also has a cousin. [The Ibdis Maw](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ibdis_Maw) can be found on the planet Bracca and unlike their carnivorous cousins the ibdis maw feeds on metal scraps from the junkyards. Its large tentacles pulling down entire train cars and small ships with ease. The Maw in fact is one large creature that consisted of a number of mouths connected by a vast digestive system located hundreds of meters below the surface of the planet.

On the theme of larger cousins I would be remiss if I didn't mention the [Greater Krayt Dragon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Greater_krayt_dragon). Unlike its more traditionally draconic cousin the Greater Krayt more resembles a serpent with a dozen finned legs that it uses to swim under the surface of the dune sea hunting for bantha and other animals. While possessing the coveted kryat dragon pearl like their cousin the Greater dragon also had a acid sack that allowed it to spew corrosive acid at any attackers.
 
Everyone is most likely familiar with the [Zillo Beast](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zillo_Beast) that was discovered on Malastare and was transported to Coruscant where it caused mayhem until being brought down. While originally being thought to be native to Malastare the existence of a zillo beast on Benathy as well as Palpatine's interest in it raises the possibility that the zillo beast could be one of the number of Sith warbeasts that were created in the hundred-years darkness and other sith wars. 

Much like the zillo beast the [Tirra'Taka](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tirra%27Taka) slumbered underground beneath the capital city of the planet Serenno. Possibly a type of [leviathan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leviathan_\(creature\)) the tirra'taka was a large reptellian dragon that the sith used to conquer the planet until the locals rose up and sealed it away underground until Dooku awoke it and used it to dethrone his brother. 

Other lesser known kaiju were the [Carnellian Dragons](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Carnelian_dragon) of Carnelion IV and the large  predatory beasts with curved horns, long tails, and thick skin known as [roggwarts](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roggwart) that lived on Mustafar.

tl;dr I was once a young Star Wars fan but I lost my interest and forgot majority of the lore and i'm only recently picking up the pieces again.

Anyways, I need help, I'm rewatching the movies on Disney Plus to get properly acquainted with the lore, and the Clone Wars series.

ShKhatibi,1615595503,m3v6rg,38,1,"I personally love this movie. From the beginning to the end. I admit that the first time I saw it, it was just a low-quality Star Wars, but after each time I saw it, I fell in love with it more and more and I found a reason for it.

The film is full of great sequences and elements, beautiful decisions, amazing tributes, but the film itself has a big flaw in connecting these good points together. Mostly due to excessive speed and poor film editing. (it's amazing how someone who edited TFA with one of the bests edits ever, edited this too. that makes me think about something like The JJ cut.)

After reading the TRoS novel, it became the best Star Wars for me. And why? Because now I could make good connections between those elements. Now the logic of the film was not empty for me, now the emotional burden of the sequences was induced in me, now the short and aimless action of the film had become meaningful and beautiful for me.

I am interested in the Star Wars novel and I always read several at the same time. And I really recommend reading the novelization of this movie to all of you. It made me really fall in love with the movie itself.

I know that not all Star Wars fans read novels, but even without the novel, over time they fill in the blanks with their minds and understand the meanings of the film.

That's why I think the next 5 years will be like this movie even without reading the novel. I very much hope that the story after TRoS will be told as soon as possible.

I have loved TFA for a long time and I always knew it as one of the best SW ever. I really enjoyed TLJ and although I admit that it is an amazing movie, I am dissatisfied with some of its decisions and it was a little bit boring for me, but I still like it. And now, after seeing TRoS 18 times and reading the novel, I consider it the best sequel movie and my favorite SW of all.

It's absolutely right that many people do not like the film or call it weak, but I liked it and I hope they are happy that I can enjoy it and every time I see it, I get more meanings and points from it.

I was having a birthday party at my house, Star Wars themed of course, the phantom menace just release in theaters and it was a huge deal for me and many others. Before then, all I had was the original trilogy on laser disc that I wanted more times then anything else in my 10 years of life. 

The party was great I remember, we had a lot of fun and when it came to present time I got plenty of Star Wars stuff to hold me over for the next 3 days. Then came the surprise present, which was that we were going to see the new movie that night. As a 10 year old, this is a solid moment to excuse shitting your own pants in excitement. At this announcement, another kid was very excited and that he had an announcement of his own! He told us that he already saw it, and that Qui-Gon dies in the end. The room was silent as we all stared at the kid, dumbfounded by what he just said. He ruined the ending of the movie for everyone in the room, and I remember it clearly 21 years later, to the point that every time I think of this movie, I remember my 10th birthday, and how it changed how I view this movie for the rest of my life.

[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/8067/if-only-the-sith-deal-in-absolutes-why-does-obi-wan-say-it-that-way?newreg=8961be109aeb462f80e57bb6714aa092](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/8067/if-only-the-sith-deal-in-absolutes-why-does-obi-wan-say-it-that-way?newreg=8961be109aeb462f80e57bb6714aa092)

and wanted to weigh in but was prevented by the (seemingly ridiculous?) reputation requirements.

While the answers there give some well-motivated reasons for the phrasing both in- and out-of-universe, I was especially interested by the answers that disagreed with it being an absolute statement.

The consensus among these answers was that 'deals' is somewhat non-descript and as it isn't \*directly\* referring to whether or not the person is an enemy it isn't 'absolute'.

In my opinion this is completely nonsensical, and made all the more frustrating by these people claiming that everybody who thinks the statement is absolute has a poor grasp on the english language.

Obi-Wan says 'ONLY a sith deals in absolutes'. The logic of the statement implies that if you deal in absolutes, you are a sith. It would be impossible for you not to be, because ONLY a sith deals in absolutes. That categorisation is absolute, and leaves no room for interpretation if dealing in absolutes is something you have engaged in. Therefore, by applying this logic, Obi-Wan has declared himself a sith.

It's worth noting the converse is not necessarily true: being a sith does not necessarily mean you must deal in absolutes, as far as Obi-Wan has said. This does not make the statement any less absolute though because if person A deals in absolutes, we can be \*absolute\*ly certain that person A is a sith.

Does anyone else have some interesting interpretations of the phrase?

Hello Star Wars Fans I come to you in need of help.

I am looking for a moment in a Sci-Fi series or movie or audiobook where there is an emphasis on a new incoming transmission. I am aware this happens countless times through many series (Star Trek, Stargate SG-1) but I am **not** talking about a casual 5 second audio of ""New Message received"".

I mean a moment something like this: ""*Captain, we have picked up an unidentified radio signal*""

*""Origin unknown, possibly Alien""*

*""Patch it through"" ""What is it? Run scans""* etc etc.

JakeSkywalkersGhost,1615511366,m35trd,1,1,"So what LFL wasn't able to get across in that bad character description is that Leoxi is a beach bum. He is a dyed in the wool cliche peace and love hippie who would be living in a van with shag carpets by a beach if he could stay in one place long enough. He's also constantly chewing on spice sticks, even while flying at times. 

His whole introduction has him painted as someone who even the Masters find odd and who thinks a half open shirt and a bead necklace is perfect formal wear. Also later on in the story we find out he may not have always been a peace loving hippie. 

And in his own high words here is why the Vessel is called that 

""She grinned and pointed her thumb at the door. “Of course not. I’m the copilot, Affie Hollow. He’s the pilot.”

A teenage copilot seemed questionable to Reath, but when he looked in the direction she was pointing, all those questions vanished, replaced by far more pressing ones. Questions like: Is that man’s shirt open to the waist? Is he holding out his arms to us like he wants a group hug? Does he want a group hug? Is that guy on spice? No—how much spice is that guy on?

“Beautiful children,” said the pilot, with a laconic drawl and a huge grin. “I’m Leox Gyasi, and I hereby welcome you to the vessel.”

There was a brief pause, which made Reath feel better; even experienced Jedi weren’t totally sure how to approach this guy. Dez finally stepped forward with his usual charm. “Dez Rydan. A pleasure to know you. What’s the name of your ship?”

Leox and Affie shared a glance, clearly in on a joke that was about to be sprung. “Already told ya,” Leox said. He was a tall, tan, and rangy human, and his wavy dark blond hair looked as though it might not have been combed recently. Possibly ever. “Our vessel is called…the Vessel. I named it not for the container itself, but the space within the container that gives it its value and purpose. To remind me to look beyond the obvious, you know?”

That sounds like Master Yoda on spice, Reath thought. Which was either a very good sign or a very, very bad one.""

Blame it all on my roots  
 Red Guitar with Black Boots  
 And ruined your Jedi Affairs

 The last one to show  
 Yet I blasted a hole  
  In qui gon’s chest laying over there  
 

And I saw the surprise  
 And the fear in your eyes

Well, I guess I was wrong  
 I just don't belong  
 But then, I've been there before  
 Everything's all right  
 I'll just ask Obi Wan for a fight   
 Maybe I'll duel him at the door  
 

Hey, I didn't mean  
 To cause a big scene  
 Just give me an a duel with obi wan and then  
 Well, I'll be as high  
 As that Senate   
 That you're livin' in

 ‘Cause all my parts were in low places  
 When my legs went  
 my torso chased it

PenilePasta,1615497299,m30y9x,22,1,"One of the arguments against the empire is that they used slavery and thus are evil, this is true.

But the Jedi commanded the largest slave army in history with the Clones who were sentient beings bred for war with little freedom or choice. Millions of clones lived and died for a war they gave no consent in fighting, and due to growth acceleration those clones were all ages 10-11 when they graduated. I know that growth acceleration means that physically they're older, but it can be argued that we don't know if they're mentally adults because experience and time make for adulthood. 

I. The Clones have no choice in fighting, if they desert they get executed.

II. The Clones are at average, 10-11, we can assume that in some form they are still children.

impynchimpy,1615496774,m30rbv,2,1,"Hear me out here.  So George Lucas jokingly subtitled his Episode II script ""Jar Jars Great Adventure,"" as a middle finger to his critics, but he still clearly felt the pressure to significantly reduce the character's appearance in comparison to the first film.  

I was re-watching AOTC recently when a thought struck me.  There's a huge gap between the scene when Padme entrusts Jar Jar with her position on the Senate, and the scene later on where Jar Jar proposes to grant Palpatine emergency powers.  There's a brief moment in between where we see Jar Jar being influenced by the passive aggressive comments made by Palpatine and Mas Amedda that call into question his decisiveness.  And that's it.

Let me be clear by saying that Lucas succeeded in utilizing Jar Jar (a prominent character from the first film) to set in motion a key plot point, but because it isn't explored fully it just raises more questions.  Key being: why would Padme appoint someone so incompetent to such a vaulted political position?

So dello felegates, meesa propose this...  

In the scene where Padme appoints Jar Jar her representative on the Senate, they part ways, she walks towards Anakin and he says, 'Jar Jar?  A Senator?"" (Calling into question her judgement - essentially saying what the entire audience is saying.)  And she responds, ""He's great at paperwork,"" or ""you should see him filibuster.""  Anything that would poke fun at the elephant in the room.  We know Jar Jar is inept, BUT turns out he's actually a surprisingly competent politician.  This slight narrative change would be unexpected, changing our perceptions of a character we judged prematurely, AND support Padme's reasoning for choosing him over the countless other politicians in her sphere.  

From there, my second change would be to add Jar Jar's story in the Senate to the remaining portion of the film, cross cutting from Anakin's story, to Kenobi, to Jar Jar.  I really feel that’s something missing in this film.  We see Jar Jar get all this power, and then like an hour later he screws it up.  What the hell happened in between?

One workaround would be to insert a few scenes of Jar Jar in his new position, showing some of the pressure that being a (new) Senetor entails, with the added pressure of being incredibly clumsy. Most of us feel like Jar Jar when we enter a new line of work.  Maybe we have a learning disability, or we’re super awkward in front of new people.  The fact is, most people hired into a new position are pretty awesome at what they do were they not hindered by some of these baked-in personality traits.  What if Jar Jar's story was woven into Ep II, exploring a Gungun trying to overcome his weaknesses and take on a role HE knows he’s capable of, but others think he'll mess up.  It’s a story element that might actually act to enrich the character and redeem him from the one-note comic relief of the first film.  

On top of that, it keeps Jar Jar a relevant and critical part of the overarching prequel narrative, which was George's plan from the start.  Still trying to figure out how he would factor into Episode III so I open the discussion if anyone has any suggestions.",StarWars,"What if Episode II was actually (in part) 'Jar Jar's Great Adventure?""",3177,552,5.755434782608695

We all know George Lucas. He is like a god when it comes to pop culture. Now don't hate me but, As much as I love Star Wars, I don't like him as a person. Hear me out before you downvote.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt he never liked the fans and interacting with them. I feel that he looks down upon us instead of embracing the millions and billions of people who love his stories. I've heard numerous stories about how rude he is to the fans and he's one of the worst celebs to meet in person.

 Also, the obvious, He won't release a GOOD version of the theatrical OT. He's ruined the hopes and dreams of millions. I wish he was (when he still owned LucasFilm) more like Kevin Feige who embraces the fandom. I love what George has given us and he's made my live so much better but I wish he was more embracing towards fans.

Currymonster1,1615449404,m2l1yd,7,1,"Rewatching RoTS and I can’t help but believe Anakins choke was what killed his wife. 

I’ve seen a popular theory floating around that palpatine actually killed padme by draining her life force to sustain anakin. Yes, this enhances sidious’ character in a sense but I’d argue the real magic lies in the tragedy. 

Ep 3 frames Anakin’s primary internal conflict around his love for his wife and his duty to the jedi council. He has a vision of her dying and suddenly this conflict is shifted heavily towards one side. The said savior of prophesy has now found his own to which he seeks to prevent.

Palpatine manipulates him to believe he should join the dark side and maybe save his bae, so he takes the chance. Then he self-full filled the prophecy of his own making by choking her out and nearly killing her before childbirth and so she dies giving birth to the very children that would redeem him. his own fate that he gave up everything to thwart.

THATS beautiful to me. It’s tragic, painful, and listen I understand the “palpatine actually killed her” part of the fandom. That elevates HIM, but to what? He’s just... MORE manipulative than he was before? I don’t find that interesting. It doesn’t expand on the tragedy of Vader. Really the manipulation of anakin throughout his life and in the confrontations in his office and at the opera serve that point perfectly fine.

Yikes this was a rant. I don’t post a lot on Reddit ever, but this rewatch triggered something in me.

--TheForce--,1615425821,m2eijh,0,1,"*Q. You did American Graffiti for George Lucas, playing the role of Bob Falfa. Did he call you again for Star Wars , or how did you get the ‘Han Solo’ part.* 

A. I made no effort because George had let it be known to the agents that he wasn’t going to use anybody he’d used in American Graffiti. So I didn’t think about it. I didn’t enter into the picture until about 3 or 4 weeks before they were due to make the decision. I was asked to do a video tape test, which I did, and then they asked me to help them with other people’s video tape test... it seems like I must have done 75. Then I was told they wanted me to do the part, and that was it. I didn’t even have a script. 

*Q. When you made Star Wars , what did you think of the film and the part you were taking?* 

A. I thought it was real good part - the character was humorous, and I thought that those things that weren’t exactly funny in the script, probably would be … I thought it was going to be funny. I didn’t think it was going to have such a wide audience, it was just a good part for me! I never tried to judge whether this was going to be successful or whether people would like it. For me, it was a simple opportunity to play a character that I knew the audience would like. It was the first time a character I had played was so important to the film. It was necessary that this character worked, as necessary for them as it was for me - so, that opens up a kind of atmosphere, a good environment for collaboration. 

*Q. How did you actually get into movies?* 

A. When I first came out here I wanted to be in movies, I came out here to be in movies, but I didn’t even know what the names of the major motion picture studios were. We stopped in Laguna Beach where we saw the ocean for the first time and rented an apartment. It was close enough to Los Angeles to get a little grubstake. We had taken a month to go across the country, so it was a good rest spot. I did a play in Laguna Beach, John Brown’s Body , and somebody, a man named E.M. Bernard who was doing the music to that play, was also doing the music for Laugh-in and had some link to Columbia Pictures. He asked me if I would like to meet the guy who was head of casting for Columbia. I said “sure, why not” - it was the first time I had ever been in a movie studio. I went in to this huge paneled office, and there was this guy talking on two phones, and another guy behind him on another two phones, literally, and 1 sat in a straight-back chair for about 10 minutes while they talked big bucks, big names. They kept switching from one phone to another, covering one mouthpiece, then the other mouthpiece, and shouting back and forth - just like in the movies. You know, I thought they were probably doing it for my benefit -1 couldn’t imagine how life could so imitate the movies. But sure enough, it was for real and finally the first guy finishes up and turns to me and says “What’s your name?”. I said, “Harrison Ford”. He said, “Who sent you?” I said, “E.M. Bernard”. He asks the guy behind him who E.M. Bernard was and the other guy says, “Never heard of him.” He said “How tall are you?"" “6’1,6’0” How much ya weigh?” “190” - now he’s giving me a little 3x5 card to put the information on. “Do you ride a horse?” “Any other special hobbies, talents, etc.” Finally, “thanks, we’ll see ya!” I walked out, went down the hall to the elevators, realized I had to use the bathroom. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out, his assistant is coming down the hall, saying to me, “Come back, he wants to talk to you.” If I’d gone on the elevator, I would have been gone and nobody would have bothered to chase me. When I went back, the first thing the guy says is “How’d you like to be on a contract?” I said, “How much?” The guy says “7-year contract for $150/week.” It wasn’t great, but it was my introduction. I had been in California for six months, I wanted to be an actor, and all of a sudden, I “were’ one.",StarWars,"Excerpt of a Q&amp;A with Harrison Ford from Bantha Tracks #6.

So I'm imaging a story where a very good-hearted Jedi wins a fight against a dark side user, but his lightsaber is destroyed in the process. Immediately after the duel, he sees that a village is in danger and desperately needs a lightsaber to protect the village. As he has no other choice, he wields the red lightsaber. Throughout the story we may see that his thoughts and intentions begin in a place of serenity and benevolence, but eventually turn more towards anger towards his adversaries. He would ultimately use the dark side to defeat these adversaries, but where he goes from here is the writer's choice. Does he realize that he has been swayed and put down the lightsaber and try to return to the light? Or does he embrace these new powers and convince himself that he would never allow himself fully to the dark side? Perhaps his conflict between light and dark turns the saber to purple by the end of the conflict.

Boba Fett was overlooking them with a scoped rifle, missile jetpack.
Instead of firing his missile to destroy the skiff and kill all four targets including the supposed Last Jedi, or using his scoped rifle to kill Luke and take the other three alive, he decides to close the distance, Landing right next to Luke and instead of pulling the trigger instantly, he gives Luke a chance to turn around and disarm him, doing nothing and falling.
Instead of drawing a secondary pistol, using any of his gadgets, he shoots a rope dart around Luke and doesn't use his wrist Blaster, flamethrower, knee darts, pistol, or any bladed weapon he may have, he just patiently waits for luke to cut the rope and gets knocked out.

Finally he regains Consciousness, turning his back to longtime enemies Han Solo and Chewbacca to try and shoot Luke, aiming miles above his head with his wrist Blaster he could have used moments earlier, missing as if he's never used the gadget before, nor did he use his missile to blow up the other skiff, instead he gets hit in the back by his opponent who was saying his name and armed, flailing into the sarlacc pit screaming the entire way and doing nothing to prevent himself from falling inside.

Not trying to rip on Return of the Jedi here, but compared to how he was depicted in Empire Strikes Back, and even the prequels as a child.

dswails,1615415524,m2av0q,3,1,"Count Dooku is one of my favorite characters. His erudite manner and overwhelmingly complete abilities as a combatant make him a model of what I think a good villain should be. Which is why I have never been able to understand his relationship with Sidious. Dooku’s age, politics, and abilities make it hard for me to believe he would willingly submit to Sidious as an apprentice. The story would make way more sense if we got to see some tension between the two, as if it isn’t really clear who is master and who is apprentice. It would also offer a more compelling end. 

In my head, the story should have been that Dooku left the Order after Qui-Gon’s death and the council’s refusal to take serious Obi-Wan’s claims that the Sith have returned. Dooku eventually tracks down Sidious and they duel, but sensing that there’s more to Sidious’s plans and that he may not be able to beat him outright because their powers are too closely matched, they call a truce. They are each neither master nor apprentice, but co-conspirators. Together, they defeat Darth Plagueis and initiate the Separatist Crisis. But throughout the entire process they constantly attempt to undermine one another, with Dooku still holding some allegiance to the light side of the force even if he believes the jedi need to be destroyed. A nice rivalry between he and Mace Windu who were said to be equals as duelists in their younger days would parallel nice with Sidious’s eventual fight with Yoda and Obi-Wan’d duel with Anakin. Where Mace is a champion of the light with dark side tendencies, Dooku is a champion of the dark side with light side tendencies. And Windu’s inability to see what Dooku is trying to do by infiltrating the Sith convinces Dooku that the jedi are ultimately a lost cause and need to be destroyed.

While I could see it coming and thought the sentiment was sweet enough, something about it just felt really dumb and unearned (and I'm not a Rey-hater.)

But before the film came out, speculating on the title, it seemed like a lot of people, myself included, were pretty down for the idea of Rey taking on Skywalker as a title, or as the name for a new style of force user, instead of moving forward as a Jedi.

The reality seemed to rule that out as we're definitely meant to take it that she's going by Skywalker *as opposed to* Palpatine and not for much more reason than that. But does it rule it out? While the film definitely intends it as a surname, I don't see why going forward, when and if something explores her setting up a new Jedi order, or trying to, she couldn't use ""Skywalker"" as a title equivalent to ""Darth,"" for just the leader of the order, or for Jedi that achieve a certain rank, or just for apprentices that are taken on and either don't have known names or want to take on a new identity. It feels to me like that would be a cool way to incorporate the name into future stories that retroactively would make that final TROS moment a bit more meaningful.

Ok, I know it's weird, but lemme explain. 

In episode IV when Obi Wan says that he never had a droid you may think that this is just because the movie was released before the prequels (since we see hik with R4 in episodes II and III), but why would the writers of the prequels make him have a droid even tough he clearly said that he DIDN'T, or even how would he not remember R2, I mean, why would these droids be there if he ""never had one"". So my theory says that Obi Wan had dementia due to the stress that he suffered after the events of Episode III. And that's why he told Luke that Anakin was killed by Darth Vader he's memory was that Darth Vader and Anakin were not the same person, he forgot what happened in Mustafar and believed in another story based on the interpretation of his own mind.

Anyway, after research, his history is pretty tragic. He was a proud leader of his people, fell in love with another of them. She died in battle and he was so struck with grief he called himself Grievous from then on and would be heartbroken forever.

When his home was invaded by the Huk people, the Jedi sided with them and forced Grievous and his people back where they were left to starve and die. When the Huk army came back, the Jedi did nothing to help, so that built up his rage against them.

For help, he reached out to the banking clan, who had him become an enforcer for them in exchange for helping his people. When he went home because of the Huk army acting up again, and wanting revenge, the baking clan and their alliance with Dooku planned a bomb to blow up on his ship. That way he could be used for the Siths goals in the upcoming war. Dooku then lied and convinced Grievous it was the Jedi who tried to assassinate him. He was then turned into a cyborg to keep him alive, and he became a serious threat to the galaxy.

His life sucked, yo. He loses his love, gets turned away by the Jedi, gets betrayed by the ones who helped him, and is being used by the Sith as a tool. I feel sorry for the guy honestly.

That was my thoughts on it until I found out that's in Legends. The canon history isnt even expanded like that. All they said was he was a great warrior, attracted the attention of the Sith, they shot down his ship and then salvaged him to be used. No heartbreak, no honor on the line, no reason why he changed his name, nothing.

WHAT A START! Hot damn it was good! I enjoyed the variety of Jedi that the story presented but I do feel there were too many view points, especially the ""one chapter"" characters, personal highlights were Bel Zettifar and Loden Greatstorm, loved those guys. I can't wait to see how the adult section of the story will continue

a Test of Courage- 6/10
Now I'm fully aware that I'm a 23 year old, this book is not meant for me, it had some great moments however, wish there was a bit more age variety in the characters but again, this is meant for 7-11 year olds so makes sense with the ages that were there, also the story was incredibly dark and depressing for a kids book... I do like Vernestra and Imri as a pair, I wasn't too keen on Honesty but I liked Avon's constant questioning and challenging, J-6 was a nice breath of fresh air and an insight into the droids of the era and how they act.

into the Dark- 8/10
Reath Silas was an amazing protagonist who went through the biggest journey out of all of the characters so far in the series as a whole. All the supporting characters added depth to the story as a whole a part from Affie, I just didn't dig her. I think the only actual downside is that there is A LOT of back and forth with the plot, character has to go here, gets back, has to go to another place, then back again. If you've read it, you know exactly what I'm talking about. That's why it's an 8 but I'm looking forward to following Reath's journey in the future!

Nevermorre,1615295928,m167b3,8,1,"So if I were put in charge of this 'rock' and try to make it a half  way decent character.....hmmm....some sort of symbiotic moss or a  bacteria colony. A microscopic organism that lives within the pours and  colonize the rock, like an ant colony is what I'm picturing. So the Rock  itself is not alive but is so infused with the organism that the common  people really do believe the rocks are alive. When Jedi sense the life and force flowing through the colony, they did  make initial investigations into the ""living rocks"" and just  misunderstood what they felt. To distinguish them from the Borg, though  all I know is what you just told me. I've heard of them but never in any  detail, I have zero interest in Star Trek. Anyway, to differentiate the  two species, the ""microscopic colony"" I'll call it - basing the idea on  the human microbiom, the helpful bacteria not only in our gut/stomach  to help us digest, but all throughout us. I've just learned about it in  some detail and it's insanely fascinating. 

So anyway, These rocks are the perfect environment for the micro  colony to thrive. Since this species is force sensitive as well, each  colony...fuck do you know how hard it is to fuckin concentrate when your  kite high and ADD prone...anyway I digress. Each rock has it's own  colony and each colony works as a single unit and ""develops"" an  indvidual personality or at least a basic communication with other  species as well, just depends on the intelligence scale you want their  base to be. So, to throw ""the force has a seance of humor"" in, which I  could respect if they gave a half ass chance of doing it well. Not only  are these writers idiots, they have all the creative spark of a newborn  shitting itself for the first time. Now what was I saying.

Ah yea, if you want to have some actual fun with the force, then when  the first micro colonies became sentient each ""rock"" could communicate  and possibly have some basic interaction with eachother, developing  their own ""culture"" &lt;---- how many bacteria culture and human culture  puns and jokes can you make from this...this could be pretty good.  Anywho, once this species comes in contact with another force sensitive  that could communicate with them, and just for simplistic sake (it was a  super woke nonbinary LGBTQJHVCKLGTHMKIUGTFDTJHM+ Jedi woman, and her  special partner,  who was also the top Jedi scientist and who just  happens to specialize in this relevant field, whatever it may be.  She/They/It starts to communicate with these rocks and the couple start  calling them living rocks. The micro colonies understand that a  miscommunication had been made, one was about to correct the Super  Science Couple but then another, more misctvious colony quickly stops  the other, in their own way as not to alert the outsiders.  ""Wait, let them think we are just rocks who can ""use the force"" somehow,  not only will it keep us more secret and safe, it's so stupid it's  funny. Let see if the rest of these creatures fall for it. If they  do....what happens if we can find new hosts who are also force  sensitive? What if we can take them over?

Not only can you just have an entire species play a huge joke on the  majority of the universe, There will be some who will know the colony's  for what they are right away. You can also plant the seed of some Sith  ideas of a bacteria dominating Jedi, taking over their bodies, and  combining both the colonies ablities but also the Jedis and enhancing  them past the sum of their whole. You could make some real fucking  monsters out of the most peaceful or influential Jedi and make one of  the brightest lights of their time, into a being of terror.",StarWars,"Geode, From High Republic, 'Appears' to be a rock [Language]",3693,646,5.71671826625387
kevingreenleaf,1615289161,m14hk1,14,1,"Anakin would have become 10x more powerful than Vader if he hadn’t turned to the dark side. Turning to the dark side is a weakness, because only the weak cannot resist it. That’s why Obi-Wan beat Anakin in Revenge of the Sith, he was stronger and could resist the dark side, he only lost later in ANH because he was very old. Also that explains how Luke could beat him in ROTJ. The light side is stronger, so if he stayed in the light he would have become stronger. The light always wins.

FalleonII,1615254269,m0vsjx,40,1,"I thought about it a few days ago. When we all saw Snoke in Episode VII, one of the main things everyone was talking about was his backstory. What was his species? Where did he come from? Was he more powerful than Vader or Palpatine? When did he take Kylo Ren as his apprentice?

Then, the countless theories emerged. ""Snoke is Darth Plagueis"", ""Snoke is Darth Vader"", ""Snoke is the one younling we see in Episode III""... god, I even heard that Snoke was Luke's spouse deformed and wanting revenge. It was funny because Snoke could be anyone, or maybe something completely new. Everyone had his own personal opinion. And then, the first Episode VIII trailer came out.

At that point, everyone was asking himself who the hell Snoke was. We saw him not in an hologram, but physically, torturing Rey. I remember different people of the Star Wars media stating that he was, in fact, more powerful than the Emperor was, and that at some point of his life he met Luke and confronted him. The New Republic was said to be responsible for his scars too, being this the reason of his hatred towards them. I'm sure we all had great hopes for such a villain...

But then he died.

And two years later, he was simply said to be a clone.

thelegend90210,1615230224,m0n6zd,14,1,"One of the most debated topics in star wars is that luke wants the jedi to end after being the creator of a new jedi order. But I think I understand why now.

Luke believes being a jedi, using the light side, is a paradox. When he gets close to a dark side chosen one, like vader or ben, the force tells him to kill them. With vader, he was beating him up before getting him to the light. With ben, the force told him to press the lightsaber down to kill the sith's new chosen one, because that will keep the light intact. 

BUT, as soon as he's about to kill ben and vader, he realizes that that will just make him to the dark side, since the jedi shouldn't use the force to kill. So he thinks the jedi should end, because the force tells him to kill the dark side, but that turns him to the dark side.",StarWars,I think I understand why luke wants the jedi to end now.,803,161,4.987577639751553
Guitartist88,1615228829,m0mmeb,12,1,"A common criticism of Star Wars is that the dialogue is often cheesy or awkward. I've got a theory as to why this is the case.

George Lucas has cited film serials from the '30s and '40s as inspiration for Star Wars. Perhaps Lucas *intentionally* wrote Star Wars in the style of these old serials.

With this in mind, I find the dialogue less cheesy/awkward and more old-timey/charming.

Now, those last two are particularly important. We've never seen another species in Star Wars quite like this, one that is so rare, and so powerful in the Force, but, what if the cause of one is the cause of the other. The theory that I can up with is that each member of the Species, is almost created by the Force itself at a focal point for the Force. So, Yoda is around 900 at the time of the Prequels, and Mace Windu refers to the Sith becoming extinct around a millennia ago. Well, what if this number is slight off, and it was around, say, 900 years ago. The supposed destruction of the Sith, the rise of the Light and the Jedi and the Republic for the next near-millennia is a pretty huge event, and certainly a focal point, not just for the Galaxy, but for the Force. We also have Grogu, born in the exact same year as 'The Chosen One', Anakin Skywalker. That is one of, if not the biggest game changer for the Galaxy, and the Force. And Dave and Jon know their stuff, I doubt that is a coincidence. Finally, we have Yaddle. Well, and I may be wrong about this, she is about 400/450 at the time of TPM. So she'd be about 200 at the time of Light of the Jedi. Could something have happened in that time period? It's completely unexplored, so they could do pretty much anything. Possibly the finding of Hyperspace, or development of it to a commercial degree, that's a pretty major event in Galactic History, and, again, the Force. Or something else?

FakeCrip,1614893672,lxw1se,8,4,"Hey everyone! A recent rewatching of the prequels inspired this post. As a fan of prequels I've always had to grapple with the messy parts of trilogy. It's up for debate if TPM or AotC is the weakest link but imo it is the latter. The main purpose of Episode I is to establish a new chapter in the SW universe. Episode II has the burden of introducing adult Anakin &amp; planting the seeds of Vader. 

Lucas has said in interviews that his intent for AotC was basically to be a space rendition of Dr. Zhivago. With that in mind, I can understand his narrative choices even if they're not necessarily what I want as a viewer. What I propose is a rewrite of the first act of AotC.

In my version of AotC, the film begins with Anakin &amp; Obi-Wan returning to Coruscant for Anakin to undergo the Jedi trials. They arrive on the planet &amp; are unexpectedly greeted by Chancellor Palpatine. He admires how much Anakin has grown &amp; asks how long he will stay. Anakin replies that his missions will soon take him back to the Outer Rim. Palpatine ends the brief exchange with a cryptic hint implying that Anakin may stay on Coruscant longer than expected.

Obi-Wan leads Anakin away &amp; the two of them report to the Jedi temple. Anakin undergoes the trials and demonstrates his power with the Force and the seven lightsaber forms. The Council is highly impressed with Anakin's development after only 10 years of training and award him the rank of Jedi Knight. Anakin is showered with praise for a second time, feeding his arrogance &amp; ego.

Following the trials Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin stand together at an overlook &amp; watch a precession of Senator's ship arrive for a vote on recent Separatist aggression. Among them is Padme from Naboo. As Anakin watches her fondly from a distance Obi-Wan begins to express pride in the Jedi Anakin is becoming. At that moment Padme's ship explodes. Chaos ensues &amp; Anakin erupts in anger &amp; pain. Obi-Wan struggles to console him.

Following the aftermath Padme is revealed to be alive &amp; safe. The Senate vote proceeds as scheduled &amp; sanctions are imposed on the Separatist systems. Palpatine requests for Padme to remain on Coruscant but she refuses. As a compromise Padme is assigned a Jedi escort, specifically Anakin. The Council finds the Chancellor's request odd, but approve based on Anakin's recent performance during his trials.

From there the story resumes the remaining plotline of AotC. Obi-Wan investigates the assassination attempt on Padme &amp; discovers the clone army on Kamino. He tracks Jango Fett to Geonosis &amp; meets Count Dooku. The relationship between Anakin &amp; Padme unfolds &amp; they travel to Tatooine in search of Anakin's mother. Anakin slaughters the tribe of Tuskan Raiders &amp; takes his first step toward the Dark Side. Obi-Wan's distress call compels Padme to go to Geonosis &amp; the final act plays out identical to the movie.

TLDR; Change the first act of AotC to focus on Anakin as a rising Jedi. This sets him up for a greater fall at hands of Count Dooku at the end of film &amp; gives his character better justification to betray the Jedi in RotS (not taking TCW into account).",StarWars,Rewriting Episode II: AotC,3184,547,5.8208409506398535

The first order was made from the ashes of the empire. And after episode 6 the empire was never destroyed. Sure the second Death Star was destroyed and their Star destroyers were gone but outside of the the battle of jakku and some skirmishes the empire just disappeared. Because it was being reformed into the empire by snoke. And kylo believed that Vader’s biggest mistake was falling to the light. And he wants to finish what Vader started, bringing order to the galaxy with the first order.

A-happy-dolphin,1614805081,lx45wy,6,1,"Hello fellow Star Wars fans.

I haven’t read in a while but recently got back into it. Currently reading Harry Potter but after that and a couple other books I would like to read some Star Wars books. So far the books I’ve read so far are last shot, master and apprentice, resistance reborn, thrawn treason and alliances, Ashoka, lords of the sith, from a certain point of view, dark disciple, rebel files, book of sith, the bounty hunter code, imperial handbook, and a bunch of character encyclopedia, visual guides, and lego Star Wars books. I also have dooku Jedi lost, the eesential guide to warfare and heir to the empire among a couple others, though I haven’t read them yet.

My main question is what book suggestions do you have. A bit of info on my tastes will help so I will provide it here.

I’m fine with both canon and legends, though since I’ve only read one legends book and I forgot what happened in that book I am unfamiliar with legends. I understand that people will likely suggest the thrawn books first, especially  because I have the first book already, but I’m curious on what other legends books are good starting off points.

My favorite time period is the clone wars, although I would like to read old republic material is I find that period interesting whenever I read about it on wookieepedia or hear about it in a YouTube video.

I don’t want to get too involved in a long series, at least not yet. There are many books other than Star Wars books that I want to read and I would like some space for those books between my Star Wars books.

My favorite type of books are action and adventure, although I’m open to trying new types as I haven’t read many other types of books. I’ve heard lost stars is really good and I’m interesting in reading that even though I haven’t read any romance books before.

Although the current high republic books interest me they don’t interest me enough to want to read them at the moment. I would rather save those for later when that time period is a bit more developed. I haven’t really been following high republic news recently and have been out of the loop, so I would like to do a bit of research on my own time before jumping in.

I love anything Jedi/sith related, as I find that incredibly interesting. Same thing goes for clones and the empire.

Lastly I’m also a big sucker for visual guides and encyclopedias and books like that, so if you have any good recommendations I may check them out.

Thanks in advance, both for the suggestions and for reading this long post :).",StarWars,Book suggestions,2544,464,5.482758620689655

For me, it truly is the best scene of the sequel trilogy. 

If you dissect the scene alone for a moment and take it as a stand-alone. The cinematography is breathtaking and _so_ Star Wars, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Every technical aspect has been done to perfection. The set design is truly magnificent, that really gives weight to the setting and character. The colour scheme is perfect, matching with the costumes and Aurora of the First Order so well. The score is perhaps the best part, a beautiful string piece that JJ let’s play out in all its glory, creating a real sense of ‘crescendo’ and tragedy. The score ties all the shots together once the starkiller has been fired. From the gorgeous wide shot of Kylo watching to the reflection in a breathtaking close up of General Hux’s eyes. The special effects meanwhile are absolutely mind blowingly good. From subtle ones to big ones. The special effects are truly something we’ve never seen pulled off before that good in cinema. It’s the first time we the audience get a real true feel and weight to mass destruction weaponry in the SW universe. From the trees blowing from the shock-force, to the laser beam slowly making its way to the system of planets and totally destroying them. It all adds up to a masterpiece in CGI filmmaking. 

Now if we connect the scene to the franchise and trilogy as a whole. This scene perfectly encapsulates the classic Star Wars ‘oh wow the bad guys might actually win’ feeling they so expertly always manage to put in. We know the bad guys will never truly win, but Star Wars was revolutionary in giving the bad guys some pretty substantial victories and having those big, huge moments where it really does seem like the bad guys will win. This scene is so emblematic of that and again _so_ Star Wars. The scene is so in tune with the franchise and does such a great job of replicating that ominous and downright scary threatening nature the Empire had in the OT &amp; beyond. It’s the moment in the movie where things really turn ugly and where it really hooks the viewers into our hero’s journeys - ‘how will they ever reverse such tragedy?!’ Etc. Really great screenwriting. 

The delivery of the speech is second to none. We all know Gleeson is a phenomenal actor and wasted in this trilogy, but BOY does he bring his A-game here. With very obvious influence from Hitler, Gleason &amp; the writers team up to give a truly mesmerising and powerfully menacing speech. The words resonate through the screen and shake the audience to its core. It’s a real ‘damn son’ moment. A moment that stops the audience in its track. Gleeson’s delivery is just so, so good. 

I’d love for a discussion about this or what your favourite scene in the ST is. 

TL;DR: I could go on all day, but it really is a masterpiece of a scene.

NeilPeartsBassPedal,1614778370,lwtyep,12,1,"EDIT: Ok i was just reminded about Plagueis so for the purposes of the discussion he's gone to. No more Sith trickery!

So a thought experiment I came up with. Let's remove Palpatine from the Star Wars universe. He doesn't exist. Now how does that change things in terms of galactic politics?

I think things still occur in a similar fashion. The issues that were plaguing the Republic (Senate corruption, wealth gap between Core and Outer Rim) were not issues Palpatine created, he just took advantage of them for his own goals. But the rot was already there in the Republic. I know it's no longer canon but the book ""Tarkin"" does a good job of showing the political scene leading up to the Clone Wars. I think a civil war would happen though with different leadership on the succeeding planets end. It would probably be more a grassroots led effort without as much corporate backing. I guess that would depend on the leader of course. Is there someone as charismatic as Dokku as the face? For that end does Dokku still fall even without Palpatine around? 

I think a war still occurs and there are three key things to keep in mind.

1. This time the Jedi are aware.

Without Palpatine using the dark side to blind the Jedi they have a better  grasp of things and are able to make better decisions. Perhaps they can still prevent a war. However if not then we go to number 2.

2. This time no surprise army for the Republic ie the Clones

Without Palpatine manipulating events does Sifo-Dyas have the foresight of galactic war that leads to the clone army? It's possible but it's also possible he does not. So where does that lead things if a war starts. No clones so the Republic has to form its own army from scratch either through enrollment or conscription. On the other side with no Dokku and Palpatine working the corporations like the Techno-Union there is no droid army. If the leader of the oppositon in this alternate timeline is a grass roots man of the people type then they wouldn't take corporate help, most likely.

3. The war can be bloodier and more in the Core's backyard.

I will confess I am only on season 2 of Clone Wars so maybe there are more attacks later on. But it seems like most of the action is taking place in the Outer Rim Sieges. Coruscant is isolated, the clones do the killing and dying, not the people. So the war isn't something they need to worry about, aside from an occasional Zillo Beast. This is because we have Palpatine working things from both ends to serve his own needs.

In an alternate timeline with a different enemy and leader that may not be the case. A alternative opposition group might be more willing to engage in terrorist actions or even direct attacks on Core worlds, maybe even Coruscant itself.

Anyway, just a few ideas I had of how I timeline with no Palpy might play out. I'm curious as to what others think.",StarWars,"If we remove Palpatine from the equation, how does that effect galactic politics?",2873,521,5.514395393474088

Accompanying them are Cindel Towani and Noa Briqualon from the tv movie, *Ewoks: The Battle for Endor*. While Leia and the others help with diplomatic business at Bright Tree Village, Luke trains a new generation of Jedi. Suddenly, Bright Tree Village is attacked by a band of Sanyassan marauders. Our heroes come to the rescue, resulting in the marauders retreating after majority of their party is killed by blasters and lightsabers, but not before kidnapping Cindel. One of the marauders is injured and is interrogated by our heroes with Chewbacca holding him in place. He explains that he and his men were under orders from the son of the late King Terak, King Zakul, and his second-in-command, the Nighsister, Charal, who was able to regain human form after having a blacksmith repair the Talisman of the Raven. Before deciding to launch an attack on the Marauders stronghold, Wicket and Noa tell our heroes about her previous encounter with with them and Charal.

Back at the marauder's stronghold, King Zakul expresses his anger at Cindel, blaming her for the death of his father despite it Wicket being responsible. He and Charal are also visited by members of the Imperial Remnant who offer to help them and the marauders leave Endor. As part of the deal, Charal is made empress and is given an experimental four pronged super star destroyer called the Raven to serve as her flagship. As they are about to leave, New Republic forces attack the stronghold. The Mauraders army are able to hold off the New Republic forces long for Charal, Zakul, and other maraders to escape on an imperial shuttle, taking Cindel with them.

After the attack on the stronghold, Luke and the others, now accompanied by Teek, return to the Millennium Falcon to discuss a plan to rescue Cindel. R2-D2 picks up a transmission from the Raven. The message is from now Empress Charal who demands that the New Republic surrender to the Remnant. After contacting Coruscant, Luke

The New Republic fleet launches an attack the Raven and the star destroyers accompanying it. Once they've landed in the hanger, Luke, accompanied by Wicket, Teek, and Noa rush to the throne room, where Cindel is locked in a cage and is being tortured by Charal and Zakul. Kakul tries to kill Luke with his machete, only for the blade to be sliced in half by the Jedi's lightsaber. The sanyassan is in shock for five seconds before he is killed by Luke. The Jedi then orders Charal to surrender and release Cindel. The Nightsister refuses and surprises Luke by revealing her own lightsaber that she's kept hidden for some time. Luke and Charal engage in a duel while Wicket, Teek, and Noa free Cindel. Luke is able to put up a good fight but is overpowered as he is unfamiliar with Nightsister magic. Charal is about o kill the Jedi only for Cindel to grab Noa's gun and repeatingly shoot at the Nightsister, killing her. The five are able to escape just before the Raven is destroyed.

Nick Fury gets along with other alien races and seems to have an understanding of these race well before any one else.
Nick Fury has an eye for technology that no one else knows exist.

Mace Windu is Nick Fury in exile, much like Yoda and later Luke Skywalker. 
Realizing through the years that he had traveled to alternate Universe, Windu took the identity as Nick Furry. Sensing a dark present through the force, much like the Emperor's, Nick Fury began recruiting force sensitive individuals and guiding them to find their true potential, known as the Avengers, to protect earth and the galaxy. Rather than teach the Jedi Religion and repeat the mistakes of the past, Furry took a more hands off approach to allow the individual to naturally discover their force abilities themselves and nudged them as needed Example: Thor, force lightning. Hawkeye, force user that uses his ability to shoot. Tony Stark, force ability to communicate with technology. 
We can make a lot of parallels here with force abilities and superpowers.

By now your asking yourself how does this all come together. According to Star Wars Lore in the Old Republic the Sith Emperor who had great thirst for power and control seeking to control the galaxy under Sith rule is know as Emperor Tenebrae. By the age 10 Tenebrae had lead a path of destruction and death wiping the entire population off of his home world in a dark ritual known as force transfer. The ritual allowed him to consume all the force from all living things on the planet and short out the droids. His rule over the sith lasted 1500 years. 
In this multiverse the Emperor is Thanos. His objective is to bring balance to the universe, by wiping out half the population. V",StarWars,Mace Windu is Nick Fury in the future.,2195,379,5.79155672823219

TheMastersSkywalker,1614716171,lwbf88,4,1,"This just hit me today. So as we all know Kylo Ren is obsessed with his grandfather or at least his grandfather's sith persona. However he doesn't learn that Anakin Skywalker was Darth Vader until after the Bloodline novel (six years before the movie) and a few months before the Rise of Kylo Ren comic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up we know that Palpatine/Snoke was sending nightmares to Ben and that Snoke and Ben were even having full on conversations (at times while Ben was sitting only inches away from Luke in the passenger seat of a shuttle) and that Ben would talk to him about how he was feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its not until the Galaxy learns in Bloodline that Vader is Anakin Skywalker and her father that Ben learns. And then in less than a year the fight in the hut happens with Palpatine destroying the temple, Ben going to snoke who sends him to the Knights of Ren, Ben taking over the Knights of Ren, and then finally Ben going to endor and getting all of Vader's relics and going back to be the face of the First Order when it reappears a year after Bloodline. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if Ben doesn't learn about Vader being Anakin untill he's 23 what did they tell him all those years growing up about Anakin?

&amp;#x200B;

Well they can't really bring up anything in the GCW dealing with Anakin without bringing up Vader nor can they talk about redeeming Vader that much without bringing up Anakin. So that would leave them with just talking about Anakin during the clone wars and like Owen and Beru told Luke saying that he died at the end of the Clone Wars. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would also bring in the question of Anakin's force ghost. We know from a lore book (The Secrets of the Jedi) that Anakin's ghost visited. So either the ghost just never talked to Ben or Ghost!Anakin agreed to not tell Ben that he was once Darth Vader to appease his son and daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I guess Ben would have had to grow up hearing that Anakin Skywalker died in the Clone Wars and being told that Darth Vader was just some random Sith Lord who his uncle was able to convince to betray Darth Sidious.",StarWars,Luke and Leia must have told Ben the same lie Owen and Beru told Luke about Anakin,2115,383,5.522193211488251

LeisurelyVinny,1614701583,lw5ncz,2,1,"I was taking a shower thinking of life's great mysteries I often think about what ifs, especially with Star Wars. By the way, I am not hating on the sequels I did enjoy 7 and 8, and I like what some parts of 9 did. I personally believe there is always something out there for somebody regarding with Star Wars. Thus, I was thinking back on the theories before the Rise of Skywalker came out. And I felt like this would be interesting to talk about and want to hear your opinions on my idea.

Honestly I thought Rey was going to completely go to the Dark Side. I had this idea that she became so disillusioned on her image of Luke Skywalker and has conflicted feelings. At this time Leia takes over as the mentor role for Rey. Rey throughout the film has become to impatient for answers and adventure. She has shown to quickly get angry and start going on the offensive. She is gradually getting angry at herself possibly wasting her time when she learned her parents were nobody, at her conflicted feelings of the Jedi and Luke Skywalker, at her failed attempt to turn Ben Solo to light. 

Meanwhile, Kylo Ren is at Vader's castle on Mustafar. Constantly thinking about Rey. They haven't formed a Force Connection since they last seen each other. Constantly feeling guilty over the death of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Throughout the film he tries to search for her throughout the galaxy. 

So I really thought Palpatine was just going to have a crazy flash back scenes. That take place before the Phantom Menace. I didn't think they were going to do the clone thing from Legends. I personally thought it was better done then. And if they were going to do it, I thought Matt Smith, Doctor Who, was going to play a clone of Palpatine showing he is back and younger and more powerful. And I feel like realizing this whole time Ben solo was manipulated by Palpatine. Thus pushing Kylo towards the light more. 

I would think to explain Carrie's death they would have this young Palpatine kill her, out of revenge for his death. This would also push Rey to the dark side and Poe Dameron to take over as leader of the Resistance.


I honestly felt Finn's story kind of concluded in The Last Jedi. I was disappointed because I felt they kind of written his ending a bit. Like, he finally beat Phasma and became a rebel hero. I do have ideas of what could they done with him but, I felt like that is better for a different post. What I was thinking was Finn was going to be Rey's connection to the rest of the Resistance, kind of like an Anchor for Rey. 

I recall thinking the final battle was going to take place in Coruscant. I thought it was going to connect to the Prequels more. I feel like Rey would have striked and killed Palpatine out of some intense justice for the galaxy and kill him like brutally too. This would have drawn Rey to make that cool double bladed red lightsaber and be dark. She would think she is a better than a Jedi but doesn't call herself Sith. She and a redeemed Ben Solo would finally fight as the Resistance led by Poe, Lando, Chewie and everybody.

AA005555,1614430503,ltnjtj,3,12,"This has probably already crossed the minds of some of you but it just occurred to me...

When Jedha is destroyed, it fundamentally alters the rebellion in many ways.

First, the destruction leads to the death of not only Saw Gerrera but his entire rebel cell. Up until this point (and not just in RO), it’s been made clear that Gerrera is an extremist to the point that he gives the rebellion a bad reputation in some corners of the galaxy. When Jedha is destroyed, Gerrera doesn’t even try to escape. He’s accepted that the rebellion will be better off if it moves on from him and his group with people like Jyn and her friends being the new lifeblood of the Rebellion, knowing that the destruction of Jedha - him along with it - will be a better recruiting tool for the Rebellion than he could have accomplished in 50 lifetimes. 

When the Rebellion learns of the destruction of Jedha, it breathes new life and courage into its ranks, with a couple dozen rebels volunteering to help Jyn get the Death Star plans. Cassian makes a point that he, along with these volunteers, have all done bad things for the Rebellion, stating that those joining the Rogue One mission include, among other things, assassins for the rebellion. So invigorated are these rebels we can hear shouts of “for Jedha!” as they attack Scarif. At the end of the film, our deeply flawed heroes (the criminal/former extremist Jyn Erso, the assassin Cassian Andor, the cynical Baze Malbus, the former imperial droid K2SO) wiped out, seamlessly transitioning from the scruffy ragtag flawed heroes to the uniformed rebel soldiers and the (lack of better word) “pure” Princess Leia. All the characters who were in need of redemption get it. It’s almost a shame that Chirrut wasn’t a more flawed (in that sense) character as it could give the story a more “clean symmetry”, though his death was inevitable with the death of Baze anyway. 

This leaves the Rebellion in many ways born anew at the end of Rogue One, leading into the more for again lack of better word “pure” Rebellion that follows the lead of the likes of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia. Even the main droid switches from an Imperial protocol droid to a former Republic protocol droid and astromech.

WhiskeyMarlow,1614389151,ltcyph,17,0,"I understand that this might be a controversial post, but I am genuinely curious to know the thoughts and opinions of people on that subject.

WARNING: I am not bringing the matter of whether Rebel Alliance was justified in its actions or not. 

Namely, how the proverbial ""Bad Guys"" are portrayed in a fashion that offers them no empathy, no compassion, no mercy. 

It is easier to illustrate as an example.

Each Imperial Star Destroyer has a crew complement of roughly 30,000-37,000 members. You've heard correctly, thirty-seven thousand men and women serve aboard each Imperial Star Destroyer (with up to 10,000 troopers stationed temporarily as marines). 

Destroying each ISD is akin to slaughtering a small town. In the case of the Rebel Alliance, we are given dramatic shots of pilots dying, of how tragic and hurtful it is. But the killing of a crew of a single ISD, thirty-seven thousand mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters... is either not touched upon at all, or portrayed as a major victory for the proverbial ""Good Guys"", where such a massive loss of life is celebrated with bright and pompous events. 

I've been in the franchise for two decades now, and even in the mass of EU works, I cannot remember any time when any Rebel looked at the burning ISD and thought with horror: ""What have I done?""

I am not trying to justify either side in this, but in my personal opinion, Star Wars lacks any kind of self-reflection, any kind of empathy for your opponent - in fact, when I look at it, Star Wars comes off more horrifying than Warhammer 40,000, in the way it dehumanizes the enemies.

Have you ever watched A New Hope and see Luke's hair go all over the place in color? Sometimes it'll look somewhat blond, then it'll go completely brown in other shots.

Why didn't in behind the scenes, the team didn't just dye Hamill's hair so it didn't keep changing color all the time? I'm pretty sure I read that they just sprayed some lighter colors on it -- which isn't permanent and will look different in shots that are probably days apart. 

Is there something I'm missing? Wouldn't it have been less inconsistent if the team just dyed it the color they wanted -- or does blond hair go all over the place like in the movie?

UncleJunsLaserBeams,1614358416,lt1vnm,20,11,"For years I never understood why this movie was so beloved. People treated it like the second coming of Christ, and I just never saw it. I thought it was a decent movie, pretty ambitious, and of course brilliantly made. But the characters never connected with me, and I found most of it to be pretty boring.

I decided to finally rewatch it last week (doing an entire Star Wars marathon to prep for Mando, which I haven’t seen yet) and I actually really enjoyed it. “Boring” isn’t the word I’d use anymore. I didn’t pause it once, I had a great time with it.

Now let me be clear: I still don’t think it’s perfect. I have basically every flaw I had with it in the past. The characters aren’t very interesting, Tarkin looks bad, Vader doesn’t really need to be in it at all, and it tributes the OT way too much. But I stopped viewing this as a stand alone movie, and started viewing it as a Star Wars fan film… and I think it’s the best Star Wars fan film ever made.

That’s not a dig at the movie at all. It’s a movie made with love and passion for the franchise, and Edwards wanted to take this mystical world and view it through a grittier, more larger grounded lens. My investment in the story was entirely dependent on my love of A New Hope (my favorite SW film) but when I factored that in… I had such a good time.

It works really brilliantly as an extension of the Star Wars universe. But it’s not a great introduction to it. And that’s totally cool.

I just can’t get out of my head that the whole book is just one big Jedi circle jerk, it’s just puts them all on a giant pedestal and worships them. There’s so much descriptive writing as well that just embellishes them and whatever they’re doing.
Marc Thomson, who is a veteran narrator of Star Wars novels and I have enjoyed hours and hours of his work listening to previous, now Legends book series narrates this book but everything is read in a higher inflection making every sentence seem SO important even if it’s just describing a setting and then when things do ramp up it’s seems so over the top it’s jarring and irritating.
The overall subject of the book is really interesting, getting into the science of hyperspace. But the characters in and around the subject are failing to keep me fully engaged.

Again I’m just interested to hear peoples thoughts, I will persevere with the book and get it done but not sure I will race straight into the next one.

And when Luke came ang got Grogu to train him, who will take after luke when he cannot train Grogu anymore?

LieutenantRidg,1614273203,lsbisc,26,4,"So, I was recently playing Pandemic's Star Wars: The Clone Wars on PlayStation 2, and I've come across a interesting question. Now, I know the game isn't really considered Canon, but it's the only source material I can find that shows the moments leading up to the Battle of Geonosis. In Attack of the Clones, it seemed as if the Jedi strike team lead by Mace Windu had gone to Geonosis while Yoda went to Kamino. It never felt like they showed up to Geonosis at the same time as it shows in this game. Judging by the reactions of Padmé and everyone else in Petranaki arena, when the LAAT/i gunships and Acclamator-class Assault ships showed up, this was right when they descended into Geonosis' atmosphere. At least that's how it felt in the movie. So my question is: Did the Jedi strike team and the GAR along with Yoda all arrive on Geonosis at the same time? Did the assault ships wait in orbit while Mace Windu and Luminara Unduli cleared an LZ? Or did the Jedi strike team arrive before Yoda and the Clone Army and the Clone Army just so happen to arrive conveniently at the right time? I can't find any other source material other than this game that shows these events. Thank you.

Bitter_Physics,1614239214,ls18ef,127,9,"First of all, I am a relatively new Star Wars fan. I watched the prequels shortly after they we're released on DVD, but didn't really enjoy them.

What got me interested in the universe was definintely The Mandalorian. After the show, i wanted to learn more about all the characters. So i watched the prequels, sequels, and even the animated Clone Wars show. And i gotta say that they work really well as a cohesive story.

While I still had my problems with the prequel trilogy, especially the dialogue, the overall story is great and ""The Clone Wars"" expands on it brilliantly.

But when i then got to episode 7 all my excitement died. It became very obvoius that the Director was afraid of taking any risks. There are Rebels again? There is another planet destroying weapon being built? The third fucking time in three movies?
Out protagonist is living on a desert planet unaware of her powers? Wow, so original.

At this point i wasn't looking forward to Episode 8, but i continued regardless. And what the fuck was that?
They obvoiusly tried to course-correct and take the franchise in another direction, but the execution was laughably bad. I didn't mind grumpy Luke as much, but they should have explained it better. Luke wanting to slaughter his nephew in his sleep was a bit extreme. I don't buy it. 
Don't get me started on the ""this is how we win"" stuff at the end of that movie. Complete garbage.

And i don't even want to talk about episode 9. That shit felt like a fever-dream. 

The Disney movies just don't work in the  context of the other movies and i dislike them individually, too.
Sure the writing might be better than the Prequel Trilogy, but the overall story is awful.

If i had waited years for new Star Wars content only to be presented with this crap, i would be so disappointed. Yet, when i came here to talk about my experience, i found that most people here defend the Disney Trilogy and especially The Last Jedi, which is mind-boggling to me.

arnavfl,1614215439,lrszzd,48,6,"Dooku - He tells Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Republic is under the control of a Dark Lord of the Sith, so he clearly knows.

Grievous - He has spoken with Darth Sidious, so he knows that another Sith Lord exists, but he often talks about killing Palpatine, so he probably doesn't know.

Mas Amedda - In the *The Clone Wars* series, Palpatine and Amedda talk about what they should do and Palpatine says that for now, they should let democracy prevail, which is very suggestive of Amedda knowing. Also, Amedda has a suspiciously nonchalant reaction when Palpatine reoooooooooooooooooganizes the Galactic Republic into the Galactic EMpaiuh and when he fights Yoda, so I think he knows.

Maul - Not sure about this one. He says that he did not realize what Sidious had in mind to take down the Jedi and the Republic (namely, Order 66) until the clones attacked Ahsoka. So he certainly didn't know the full details of *how* Sidious would achieve his goal. However, the fact that Maul instantly realizes that Sidious is behind the clones attacking Ahsoka seems to suggest something. I think if Sidious hadn't already told Maul who he was, Maul probably figured it out when then-Queen Amidala spoke for then-Senator Palpatine to call for a Vote of No Confidence and Palpatine ended up being elected Supreme Chancellor. So this is a maybe, but I'm leaning towards yes.

Sly Moore - We don't really know much about her in comparison to the others on this list, but I think she was, like Amedda, close enough to Palpatine that he told her his secret. But this is more speculation than anything.

Tyranus introduced the inhibitor chip so that if a Jedi went rogue, the clones could be told to execute Order 66 and try to kill the Jedi (although it appears inhibitor chips were not necessary for Pong Krell because no one told those clones to execute Order 66). This Tyranus person told them that because the Jedi would probably be opposed to this, it should be kept a secret at all costs.

BlvxkByrd,1614196564,lrluar,20,0,"In RoTS Yoda tells Kenobi that he will not send him to kill Darth Sidious because he isn't strong enough to engage him and he would die a very slow and painful death. I am going to lay out the reasons why I think Yoda was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

1. His lightsaber forms. He used forms 3 and 4, with Mace Windu even acknowledging that Obi-Wan wasn't just a master of Soresu, but THE master. His defense was impenetrable and many have stated ""Defense just prolongs the inevitable"" as a point against Obi-Wan but he used forms 3 and 4 hand in hand. He would defend himself long enough to tire his enemy out and use Ataru to strike when he saw the opportunity. Obi-Wan's style has proven to be very lethal in pure 1 on 1 combat. 
2. His combat. He is no stranger to Sith Lords. We know he knows how to block force lightning and he has faced and successfully defeated more Sith than any other Jedi in the last 1000 years. We saw this when he blocked Dooku's lightning with his lightsaber. He was also even able to defeat Anakin in his prime and on top of that, we saw his strength in the force even rivaled Anakin's when they attempted to force push each other at the same time and Anakin was the strongest force user in the Jedi order at the time. Anytime Obi-Wan lost a duel it was with other people involved (Anakin). We saw how lethal his style was when he went out and had a very clean 10n1 fight with Grevious, even being able to hold off his insane 20 strikes a second with 4 lightsabers. He's also a quick thinker and pretty clever, as we saw he was able to instantly search for and find a weakness in General Greivous (his hands). He would have no trouble searching for exploits with anyone he faced as he was defending the entire time. Obi-Wan never attacked first, he was purely defensive so when he confronted Palpatine, it was either Sidious striking first (Which if he did, he would have already lost) or they just would not have fought until Yoda arrived in which if that happened, Palpatine would have been truly f\*cked. 
3. Palpatine's weakness. He was over-confident. It was so strong it blinded him and even Luke was able to use this as an exploit against him. Palpatine was shocked at the defeat of Anakin, he didn't think for a second Obi-Wan could have defeated him. So there is no doubt he would have seriously underestimated Obi-Wan which would have been his downfall. Obi-Wan most likely would not have picked up on this and used it against him in-fight however, it would only have been one of many factors leading to Sidious' loss. 

The only instance I can see where Palpatine could have defeated Obi-Wan is if Obi-Wan successfully disarmed him and as he went to strike him down Palpatine would catch him off guard and use his force lightning. We know this is a common Sith tactic, both Dooku and Palpatine have done this. (Dooku &gt; Ventress - Sidious &gt; Windu). As far as lightsaber combat goes however, Obi-Wan would have won. I understand Palpatine mastered all 7 forms of lightsaber combat but defensive cannot fight defensive, and Obi-Wan would never have fought offensively. Either Palpatine would take the offense or they just would not have fought and because of Obi-Wan's mastery of Soresu, Palpatine would have lost the second he stroke first. I have no doubt it would be a very, very long battle but it takes more energy to offensively attack than it does to defend. All Obi-Wan would have to do is just wait for his moment.

Tradman86,1614177971,lrej6x,20,8,"I rewatched recently. I know audiences at the time it was released were completely surprised by the Father Reveal, but in hindsight, the entire movie builds to that reveal. 

It starts right off the bat with the crawl that says Vader is obsessed with finding Luke. That's Vader's motive and every single thing he does further's that goal. What's interesting is it's never stated WHY he's so obsessed (until the end), just that he is and all the troops have to do what he says. 

This obsession feeds into the pursuit plot with Han and Leia. I mean he commits a vast fleet to chasing one ship through a dangerous asteroid belt, losing a lot of resources in the process, all because he's obsessed with finding Luke. 

Then there's the conversation with the Emperor, in which Vader tips his hand a little. The Emperor tells him ""we have a new enemy"" implying that the Emperor just found out about Luke and is telling Vader, who clearly already knew and didn't tell the Emperor. Then the Emperor implies they need to kill Luke and Vader is like ""Yeah, I hear you, but, just to take it another direction, what if we turn him to the dark side instead?"" Again, in hindsight, we see that Vader is not only obsessed, but also wants Luke alive, a subtle clue that feeds the reveal. 

On Luke's side of things, his training with Yoda is also telling as Yoda keeps focusing on controlling fear and aggression, being patient. Little kid me use to find these scenes boring, but it's clear now that Yoda is trying to impress on Luke the dangers of the dark side so Luke doesn't end up like Vader (his father). The cave sequence also feeds into this lesson. 

I think the reason audiences were taken off guard is because it didn't feel like there was an actual mystery these clues were feeding into. You only really notice them after you know what they lead to. I think it surprised people that a pulpy space adventure actually had some depth to it. It's my favorite SW film because I keep finding things to unpack in it.

It was a totally different viewing experience! 

Every time Vader was on screen I sat forward, knowing his history and who he is added so much more to seeing him on screen and I really hadn’t been expecting it. I always found Anakin’s fall in Episodes 1-3 quite rushed, so didn’t totally equate them as the same person but as separate characters.

But if you hate TLJ bc it kills Luke’s character from the OT... then I ask.

Do the prequels kill Yoda’s character from the OT? Because watch Empire and ROTJ and tell me after hearing Yoda in those films that he was a war general killing machine in the prequels. He goes from: “For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.” to being an all out war general. I’m going to go ahead and guess that “it doesn’t matter” because the war mainly consists of clones and droids. But I would argue that based off of the OT, Yoda would never be involved in war in the first place.

Yes, Yoda acknowledges he failed greatly during that time. So maybe that explains it. But why can’t Luke fail? Why can’t he have a period of time where he makes drastic mistakes?

Thehalohedgehog,1614111222,lqru4g,48,0,"So after seeing a meme about how often the Rey vs Kylo duel in TFA is often criticized while the similarly incredible feat of Anakin blowing up the Trade Federation ship in TPM is much less (but not completely) criticized due to the justification of him being the chosen one, it got me thinking about a mentality that I feel a lot of people have ended up believing, intentionally or otherwise: **Anakin being the chosen one does not mean other Force users are weak.** 

Whenever he (or someone related to him by blood like Luke for example) performs some extraordinary feat, the most common justification I see people give is that he and his family are strong in the Force because he was the chosen one. And that is a valid reason that I am not going to argue against. 

But I think people have let this unintentionally make them act as though the Skywalkers are the *only* powerful Force users, which is not the same thing as the *most* powerful Force users. To give a real life example, Muhammad Ali was considered the best professional boxer in the world in his prime, but that didn't mean other pros were bad by any means. 

So to bring it back to what inspired this post, just because someone like Rey isn't a Skywalker by blood (not going to get into the whole ""Rey Skywalker"" debate here, it's an entirely different topic) that doesn't mean that her or any other force user is weak. In fact were are often told that many (including Rey) are actually very strong in the Force. 
Kylo literally says Rey is in TFA. Taking the quote directly from the movie: ""She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows."" Even before the Palpatine stuff in RoS it was established that Rey was in fact strong in the Force. Maybe not as strong as someone like Anakin, but still strong. Just like how someone like Yoda is established to also be very strong, so we naturally don't question much how he can duel 1 on 1 against someone like Dooku in AotC or lift an X-Wing in ESB.

And on a related note, since when did something Force related need any other justification beyond that? It's the fucking Force! It can do all sorts of incredible things! Remember that this is the same thing that allows things like the World Between Worlds and Mortis to exist. So honestly giving a 9 year old the skills to blow up a spaceship or a scavenger the skills to beat a Sith in a duel are far from the most ridiculous things we've seen the Force to be capable of.",StarWars,Anakin being the chosen one does not mean other Force users are weak,2458,451,5.450110864745011

And if you'd rather watch a recap of my post, Kessel Run Transmissions (the guys who leaked we'd get a Bad Batch show months before it was announced!) uploaded a [video of what I go over](https://youtu.be/Vi3H1TbTt0o) in my original comment!

I was having my daily viewing of The Bad Batch sizzle reel (as one does) a while ago and I can now confidently say that the Bad Batch will meet Saw Gerrera, and possibly even Lux Bonteri, in ""the siege at Onderon."" I can also confidently say that Fennec Shand will be on Pantora, the Bad Batch (or at least Wrecker) will be on Saleucami at some point, which leads me to believe Cut Lawquane (the deserter clone that Rex meets in The Clone Wars) and his family will make an appearance, and there will be some Mandalore-related episode(s). My evidence:

* A ""siege at Onderon"" was actually teased back in The Clone Wars S7: E9 ""Old Friends Not Forgotten."" During the Battle of Yerbana, Admiral Yularen lets Anakin know that they've received a transmission from someone using Anakin's subspace frequency Fulcrum. Anakin thinks it's Saw Gerrera to which Obi-Wan replies ""Perhaps the siege at Onderon has taken a turn for the worse."" Why would the Separatists go back to Onderon? Well, I think we might find out and see a part of this siege because [The Bad Batch sizzle reel provides just enough evidence to confirm the Bad Batch will be on Onderon](https://imgur.com/a/rTEknzE). It looks like Onderon rebels are still fighting and where there are Onderon rebels, one can find Saw Gerrera. Lux Bonteri would be a senator representing Onderon at this point so he might make an appearance as well.
* We already know Fennec Shand will be in The Bad Batch, but I think she will definitely appear on Pantora. [There's a shot in the sizzle reel that shows Hunter on a speeder on what is for sure Pantora, and in the background, there's a person on the ledge of a tower holding onto another person hanging off the tower.](https://imgur.com/a/0x32jDn) If you zoom in, you can see the person on the ledge appears to have a red helmet on their head and the rest of their fit is black, just like Fennec (might need desktop to see). I have no clue who the person she's holding onto could be though.
* The part in the sizzle reel where Wrecker has a farmer fit on and he's bonking three clones is on Saleucami. [The background provides just enough evidence.](https://imgur.com/a/vSU5wgz) And where there's a farm, there's usually a farmer which leads me to believe the Bad Batch (or at least just Wrecker) will meet Cut Lawquane and his family.
* I decided to include this in the hopes that one of you can help identify this [unknown person ducking next to Hunter.](https://imgur.com/a/Xm7XhSS) It looks like Hunter and the rest of the squad are protecting him. The person's hair looks white in the screenshots, but if you watch the sizzle reel at the slowest speed, you can see that his hair actually seems more blonde. Also, it's hard to make out, but the person appears to have a red patch on their sleeve. I highly doubt it's him, but could this person be Korkie Kryze, nephew of Satine and Bo-Katan? I didn't come up with this, but everyone I've asked (admittedly only 2 people) thinks he's Korkie. I personally don't see it, the hairstyle is different, as Korkie's hair is more slicked back. The location looks similar to the Saleucami base Wrecker is in, so could that be Cut instead? Maybe he changed his hair color, but I doubt that's him too. Korkie's last appearance was in The Clone Wars S5: E16 ""The Lawless"" where he got knocked out by one of Maul's Mandalorians. However, later in the episode, when Satine is recaptured, Almec tells Maul that ""Satine's accomplices have escaped,"" so Korkie at least survived that episode. Again, I doubt that specific person is Korkie, but it wouldn't be far-fetched for him to appear.
* Speaking of Mandalorians, [it looks like the Bad Batch will be going to Concordia](https://imgur.com/a/Tvt2GAs), which is a moon of Mandalore and where Death Watch used to have a base. Perhaps we will see Bo-Katan being ousted out of power by Gar Saxon because he was made Viceroy of Mandalore by the Empire when Bo-Katan didn't want to do the Empire's bidding.
* I didn't forget about Bracca, Zygerria, etc., but those are more obvious they'll be in the series.

Final thoughts: Thinking story-wise, it seems reasonable the Bad Batch will meet these characters as they face a tough decision : what life to choose as they ""struggle to stay afloat and find new purpose"" ([from the official synopsis](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-bad-batch-series-announce)) in the post-Clone Wars era.

I've always had an idea to do my own personalised version of Attack of the Clones that makes a few tweaks and cuts out scenes entirely from the film. I felt like sharing a list of some of the scenes that I've cut/tweaked so far to make the film faster less bogged down and also less creepy and cringy.

\-I've cut out the line: ""guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all."" So now it's just: ""We made it"" we cut to a close up of the two and then we cut to the queen coming out of her ship with her guards and the ship explodes the film continues on normal until we come to the scene where Obi-Wan and Anakin come to Padme's apartment.

We see a shot of the lift going up as normal but then we cut to Jar Jar, I've cut the scene out not because I dislike the scene with Obi-Wan and Anakin but because of the length of the film itself, the original runtime is 142 minutes with credits and I've cut it down to 124 Minutes with credits ending around the 1:58:30 mark unlike the original which I believe is around the 2:16:05 mark. This simply a quality control situation.

The film continues on as usual until we cut from Anakin's line: ""I meant in the interest of protecting her master, of course."" to Obi-Wan saying: ""Learn your place young one...."" Showing Obi-Wan to be a bit more stern and Anakin respects him by not talking anymore instead of arguing back.

the film continues on as normal until we cut to the first scene with Sam or Zam depends if her name is spelt in a Star Warsy way or not, instead of seeing Jango telling her what to do we cut to her loading the droid up already adding a bit of more mystery to who she is because she has her mask over her face until a certain point.

The droid goes off and we cut to the scene where Obi-Wan tells Anakin that he looks tired and the film continues on pretty much the same from this point on until we cut to Anakin saying: ""Who hired you? Tell us. . . ."" Instead of the awful line delivery of: ""tElL uS nOw."" we cut from who hired you tell us to Obi-Wan's face looking towards Anakin as if to say: ""Anakin, mind your attitude."" to then the Bounty Hunter saying her line as usual.

Then we see Jango for the first time adding mystery to who this guy is and where he comes from. The film continues on as normal until the next apartment scene, Anakin says as usual: ""In someways, a lot of ways I'm really ahead of him, I'm ready for the trials."" and then cut to Padme saying: ""Sometimes our masters see more of our faults than we want them to, it's the only way we grow."" and Anakin says: ""I know."" showing that even though Anakin is a bit impatient he understands respectfully instead of dissing off his master acting like Obi-Wan's a prick in the scene.

We then crossfade here to the next scene, instead of anakin being creepy: ""Sorry m'lady."" He seems more genuine and nice here. :)

The film continues on until unfortunately we cut Dex's diner scene I know this is important to the film, but I've cut it simply because it drags the film on, I feel it does at least, and I like that Obi-Wan has a bit of a brain instead of asking some random diner the question. I'm thinking about readding the deleted scene where he goes to test what the dart is and then cutting to the archive scene, Obi-Wan already has some form of an idea of a planet he must've heard about before and goes searching as usual.

We cut the scene where Anakin explains to Padme about love and stuff because even thought the scene itself I don't mind it ends with creepiness as well: ""You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams."" maybe I should try and cut it down from there to ""You haven't changed a bit!"" which is more cute than the follow up line.

That's just some of the things I've cut, I'll update on more once a bit more is done. :)",StarWars,Attack of the Clones - Fanedit,3940,760,5.184210526315789

The_Kodex,1614101127,lqnt94,24,0,"May people have critizized the Prequels, hate them, and said that the story and dialogue was terrible. 

And I hear and respect that, and I see why you do very well, but here is why it actually isn't as bad as you think. 

This is my defence of the Prequels. Hopefully I'll change your mind. Maybe I won't. But here is explaining everything stupid in the Prequels, and how it's actually masterfully conveyed:

The story despite being wonky is actually brilliant when you see how it fits in with the original Trillogy. And not the whole Yoda fighting with Chewbacka and other bits of fan service but the actual main story is brilliant.

The 1st movie shows us the Prequel Era. It shows politics, how the universe worked back then, what the jedi were like and many other exotic planets such as Naboo. We are informed of the Prophecy and the Chosen One and that anakin is the key. Its not a perfect movie but it shows us all about the politics which is crucial to the story and the chosen one prophecy.

Second movie - extremely important to Anakin's arc as well as some others. We get to see beautiful neon planets that are just amazing, fantastic scenery and environment as well as an amazing atmosphere. It focuses on Anakin and Padme's awkward yet string relationship flourish. 

Now I know what you're thinking - the writing for that was terrible, but actually it wasn't, or at least kind of wasn't, as George done that on purpose to convey how Anakin has never dated anyone before and was a former slave. In a way, he nailed that awkward dialogue and Hayden Christiansen Done a wicked on portraying it.

Anyway we see Anakin witness the death of his mother, which is such an Underrated scene. That was the Birth of Vader, his first coming, Anakin's first turn towards the dark side. He slaughtered the Sand people showing his Vader come loose, and then is comforted by Padme.

In the novelization of this it explains that despite Anakin seeming very mentally channged and having issues she loved him becuase of how honest and open he was to her. So that whole ""Not just the men, but the woman and the children too"" scene was a great display of that, and that is ironically when she truly fell in love with him for not lying and being open.

We then see the birth of the Clones and Jango Fett and see the battle of genesis, which even people who didn't like the movie have to admit was awesome to see.

Next we have Revenge of the Sith. It's not my favourite Star Wars movie, but it's a brilliant underrated piece of work. I mean it's messy, and it was rushed because it was the living defenition of George wanting to climax this fantastic story with only one movie which didn't go smoothly, but we'll address that later*.

It starts with Anakin's trial that mimics Vader's final confrontation with Luke, and the emperor urging Anakin to kill Dooku. This was a excellent test of anakin loyalty, and where Luke would provail Anakin would fail and kill Dooku, coming more to the dark side.

The Anakin sees visions of Padme's death, his whole motive in the movie. This is why his mother dying in Episode 2 was so important. He felt he couldn't save her and would do anything not to lose padme too. He  wouild be manipulated by Palpatine who uses anakin's emotions to turn him dark. At the same time anakin sees he is being treated unfairly by the jedi and feel like they have abandoned him because of his urgency to save padme.

So the movie plays out how it does. Anakin finds out palps is a sith Lord, reports it to Mace. Obi-Wan 1 shots Grievus, a fine addition to Kenobis kill count  collection and Yoda helps the wookies invasion. This is important not becuase of anything to do with wookies but to show why Yoda wasn't present on the council when they confronted Palpatine.

When they did he obviously kills them. Yeah, the scene could of been a lot better and there have been many explanations to why the jedi masters died so fast but its not the highlight of the movie.

Right, so Anakin shows up and sees Mace deflecting the soon to be Emperor's Force Lightning. And this next scene is so misunderstood.

Anakin doesn't randomly turn to the darkside and betrays the jedi in 3 seconds, it's all about a choice.

What Anakin saw was the jedi who only got in his way, the person who denied him master** (yes, that scene was important too, I'll get to that) or the person who could save the one thing he cared about. Mace was gonna stop him from saving padme, and ultimately Anakin never made a choice. He literally just acted on impulse and stopped mace, who was then ""killed"" by Palps.

Anakin is now unsure of Everything. He realised what he has done and before he can comprehend it Palpatine uses padme to sway him to the dark side, and accepts. He never wanted to be a sith Lord, he just wanted to save padme and be happy. But there is more now.

At the Emperors side he could overthrow him, save padme and rule the galaxy. That's all he'd of ever wanted and explains Darth Vader's random offer to Luke in THE iconic scene.

He accepts and even murders Younglings to achive this goal. He then comes to padme.

Now I admit this scene seems pretty stupid when you see it. Anakin taking to padme and her just rejecting him, but let's think about it.

His whole life flipped upside down 5 times after mace. That's like if you decide to accidently kill the present and form a coup, you're whole life has changed.

His emotions were racing and he saw this golden light of Everything he's ever wanted and without question was trying to get to it. He was irrational, put of his mind, he couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He was extremely conflicted between 5 different things at once, and his brain physicaly couldn't handle all that's happening.

Then padme rejects him. The light is gone. His whole motivation is gone, and he's too confused and conflicted to see why, he literally was blind to himself  from greed.

This is where it begins. Anakin's rampage. He literally loses it.

He chockes padme, duels Obi-Wan in the greatest duel in Star Wars history, not to mention the most emotional by far.

This whole battle he's blinded by his lust for power and having it all crumble aways. He can't think properly and ends up with all his limbs chopped off.

Meanwhile this while time Palpatine has geniusly activated Order 66, and has taken over the senate.

This is what the PHANTOM MENACE was for. It showed EXACTLY how Palpatine became a Galactic Emperor and took over the Senate, a fantastic twist. He duels Yoda in a duel that leads to Yodas exile (again, could of been handled better but were running low on time and the original Trillogy has to be set up in every way.)

Then the epilogue. Luke and Leia delivered in both ways, Anakin becomes Vader truly and Anakin is now dead.

This scene is exactly what I've been saying. Anakin was SO overwhelmed he couldn't even remember his conversation with padme, his mind was just so twisted and conflicted its like he was drunk. He shouts ""NOOOOOOO!"" in horror of his actions and now having lose EVERYTHING he just gives up and severs the emperor.

Let's expand on this now. So the movie is done. If you haven't noticed a lot of it didn't make sense because lack of context. George wanted to tell the story but didn't have enough time but settled for this.

*Then the clone wars released and fixed so much.

One of the bets things it showed to contribute to this movie was the council.

Specifically when Ahsoka was found guilty for the bombing of the Temple.

Remember that really badly written line ""From my point of view the jedi are evil"" that came randomly from anakin's mouth and no-one knew Why?

This is a good example. The clone wars showed how the council treated Anakin and gave insight to why he was this way.

So that combined with him being put of his mind from rage, greed and betrayal, let's call it anakin's rage daze, this explains his absurd behaviour and dialogue.

Look at Padme and Obi-Wan's reaction. They are both confused with what the heck anakin is talking about because they don't know about what actually happened to Anakin.

**In the novelization of thr movie it explained Anakin wanted the master rank to enter masters-only section of the Jedi archives about ways to save padme.

This explains the whole ""Its outrageous, it's unfair"" which want part of anakin's daise, but his anger against the council for not helping save padme, making him hate the council more.

And yes, I know, George didn't plan all this during making the Prequels because he was so caught up with just telling the story.

3 movies wasn't enough to show the whole plot and the clone wars bridged the gap between this and fixed that lack of context.

All of this isn't exactly explaied much in the films, so everyone who's reading this and hate the Prequels again I understand why, but look at the context here. It wasn't stupid, besides Jar Jar, it just want told fully.

This build a Star Wars Universe that wasn't done in the original Trillogy. I truly do love the Prequels.

Yes they could have been done a lot better, yes they have many flawed but they were planned, but it want all made for money (besides Jar Jar).

And for one of my best arguments of what they are great: Their impact on the Original Trillogy.

No, I'm not tailing about you all complaining they made Vader whiney, or made Yoda a super skilled lightsaber warrior which you all hated for some reason and made Yoda and Chewie know each other. Not that impact.

I'm talking about Return of thr Jedi. I'm taking about everything in that film with Luke and Vader. The Prequel knocked it out of thr Park with tieing it in.

Luke trying to redeem Vader, fighting him, dueling him trying to bring him to the light, all amazing on their own but with the Prequels it feels so... Complete.

It makes so much more sense.

On the original Trillogy when the film released no-one knew who really anakin was besides Lukes jedi father and later revealed to be Vader himself. This all seemed like a good plot point but not something thrle fans understood 100%.

With the relase of Revenge of the Sith, take a look at all I've said.

Anakin's entire struggle with the dark side, his betrayal by those he loved and his tragic decent to become vader. Think about how we feel sorry for anakin, how he's been tormented his whole life to live as Darth Vader, a slave to Palpatine.

Then we see Luke talk to anakin, bring him back, almost calling to Episode 3 anakin. I can't describe in words now fantastically this fits in together.

Like I know George has a vision for it all but jesus christ, the way it feels like Luke is speaking to Hayden Christians Anakin years before he was cast as the role is amazing. Luke bring Anakin back and even makes him fulfil the prophecy which all makes sense now.

In the End Anakin, not vader, years before Anakin's debut fulfils the propechy. With Anakin's whole story written in the Prequels it finally comes to a climactic end with Vader's sacrafice, taking off the mask, almost a love letter to the Prequels. The way Episode 6 played out it was almost like the Prequels did come before.

In the end we finally see Anakin free, years before we we saw how important that was, and Episode 6 truly tired up all loose ends showing even if you didn't like the Prequels they are so essential to the plot of thr original Trillogy that's what makes it even better.",StarWars,The Prequels,11413,2065,5.526876513317191

Hey, I am a big TCW fan since my childhood, I watched it many times and  still do. I wanted to do this watchlist that focuses on clones. I'd suggest this list to anyone who hasn't seen TCW and is mainly interested  in it because of the clones, but also to veterans that want to spice up their rewatch. May contain weird formatting issues.

I tried keeping it  as chronologically consistent as possible, but I took some liberties to  make for a more exciting watch. My rule here was that nothing should  interfere chronologically, that certain episodes don't mess up previous  ones. On the other hand, if two episodes can live on their own and don't  reference each other (and the characters in it), I took the liberty two  put them out of chronological order if I wanted to. The only real  chronological character inconsistency is that Assaj Ventress will appear  for a few seconds in ""Rookies"", and will then later on be introduced in  ""Hidden Enemy"". But as this list is about clones, Assaj won't really  have a big role anyway, so I decided that this was okay. You'll also see Numa on Boils and Waxers helmets on Geonosis before they even met her, but that's not a big thing either. I split up some  arcs and didn't finish others to keep the topic ""clones"" relevant,  you'd have to rely on the introduction summary of each episode.

I'll explain my reasoning for this list below.

**712** Victory and Death

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Episodes  I considered to include, with a short explanation why. Many of them  have some clone elements to them and/or some clone action, but the  clones aren't the driving force of that episodes or the major part of  the story doesn't focus on them. That's why I decided not to include them.

**101** Ambush | Yoda talking about how different each clone is in the force

**102** Rising Malevolence | ""Not to me""

**113** Jedi Crash | Bond between Rex and Anakin, also talking about the necessity of the war

**114** Defenders of Peace | Same as above, also strong connection between Commander Bly and Aayla Secura

**115** Trespass | &gt;Rex

**208** Brain Invaders | Order 66 foreshadowing, resolution of Geonosis plot + many clones

**220** Death Trap | Young clone perspective, clones as brothers vs. Boba ""the outsider""

**606** Crisis at Heart | Commander Thorn, allegiance to the Republic

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**If you haven't watched TCW, spoiler warning for all 7 seasons.**

Explanation of my watchlist (long):

I started of very irregularly with **""Missing in Action""**.  My reasoning behind this is, that I think this episode is a great  introduction to what clones are and could be. The viewer has to go and take the same journey as Gregor, learning to know what a clone is and  what it means to serve for the GAR.

**""Clone cadets""** and **""rookies""**  are a no brainer. Introduction to Domino squad, Kamino, mindset of the  clones and their individualism. Also introduction to Rex and Cody, and  how important clones are for the republic.

**""Landing at Point Rain""**  as a single episode may sound weird, but I decided to include it  because I wanted the viewer to not only see what the clones did and how  they behaved with each other, but also how they really helped the  republic and the jedi, and that they can take the lead. Cody holds a briefing of the attack at the beginning and commands while Obi-Wan is injured. We also see Rex, Jet and a full out war. Geonosis is obviously also a callback to AOTC.

Now that we established what clones are, how they behave and their importance and  loyality to the republic, I wanted to shatter that POV to show  that  not everyone thinks clones should be bread for war and fight for the  republic until they die. That's why I included **""Hidden Enemy""** and **""The Deserteur""**. Interesting philosophical concepts on what the purpose of the clones really is and should be.

**""Arc troopers""**  is action packed, has a special meaning for the clones as it is their  home world, Echo and Fives get promoted to ARCs (also 99, rip). The **citadel arc**  isn't ABOUT the clones, but they do play a major part on the side of  the republic, and it inforces their reliability. Also, Echos death.

Next one may seem kind of weird too. I put a single episode of the Ryloth arc (**""Innocents of Ryloth""**),  because this episode is about Waxer and Boil (to some extent Cody). We rarely see the 212th but in this episode we see some personalities being developed, and how the ""clone wars"" affect innocents.

The reason I put the Innocents of Ryloth arc right before the **Umbara arc**, may make sense now. This arc obviously focuses a lot on clones and  their role in the galaxy, being one of the greatest arcs in the entire  series. Due to the fact we just learned about Waxer, his death will probably play an even bigger role.

I won't say much to the last arcs. They are all in order and are fine as  they are. The big inhibitor chip arc leading to Fives death, the rescue  of Echo and the mention of ""deformed clones"" vs. ""regs"". The siege of  Mandalore is obviosuly one of the greatest arcs of the entire series,  also with focus on the bond between the clones and Ahsoka Tano, specifically Rex's bond with her and the fact that Maul slowly puts together the bigger picture on what the role of the clones is in this  war. Then Order 66 and Rex, no brainer.

Backpacks_Got_Jets,1614096624,lqlziy,13,6,"Star Wars and the Original Trilogy never set up any themes that would suggest this.  

The way Obi Wan initially describes them is more descriptive of a late Knights Templar.  Powerful Religious / Military organization with no direct ties to a government working hand in hand with the Republic to do good throughout the galaxy.

Their destruction at the hands of Vader also would bring in ""Rout of the Templar"" vibes where the government turns on them because they are too powerful and influential. 

I think turning the Jedi into a monastic order crippled the wide variety of storytelling opportunities that could have existed in legends and in canon content now having to wedge every ""Good Guy"" into the same mold and then figure out how to have them branch out of that mold without ""Falling to the dark side"" 

It worked when there were a handful of jedi to talk about but with the universe expanding more and more rapidly the jedi are completely hamstrung story wise and the sith and bad guys will be our only strong outlet for creativity in force users. 

It makes the only defining characteristics of the Jedi how they break from the order's teachings rather than allowing their personalities and styles to help tell the story. 

The theme is very repetitive and it turns the wow factor of exploring different eras and Jedi storys into ""meh"" because the jedi you see in one era are the same jedi you see in the previous.  It's always a ""I don't believe the way i was taught... but oh no the dark side... let me reconcile it"" over and over.  That is great for like 2 characters.  not for ALL of the characters they try to explore from the Jedi eras.

And the jedi that stand up as ""TRUE FAITHFUL JEDI"" are the most bland of all.  yes you're a white shining flawless superhero.  How creative. 

This is why our best characters are either fallen jedi, former Jedi or Rebellion/Post Imperial Jedi

Because they leave the Monk aspect behind.

Joseph_Laban,1614080663,lqgiiq,8,13,"It's interesting to note the attitudes various Sith Lords had towards their non-Sith identities.

Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus took full advantage of their dual identities; till their dying days they went by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine and Count Dooku respectively. Doing this helped them to deceive the public - the Senate voted for *Palpatine* (not Sidious), while many Separatists believed they were following a principled former Jedi (not a Sith Lord).

On the other hand, 'Maul' was apparently Darth Maul's only name from childhood, so unlike his contemporaries he didn't need to change identities at all.

In contrast, Darth Vader *actively* tried to bury Anakin Skywalker after he got put into the suit. Initially, Vader thought of himself not as a separate person from Anakin, but rather as Anakin's fully-realised self. From his conversation with Padmé on Mustafar, we see that pre-suit Vader fully intended to hold on to much of his Anakin Skywalker life - overthrowing Sidious, keeping Padmé alive and ruling the galaxy with her by his side.

Only after he was disfigured and mutilated on Mustafar and learned that he had killed Padmé himself did Darth Vader try to stop being Anakin. All of a sudden, the 'Hero with No Fear' was no longer a persona he could wear in public. Out of shame and self-loathing, Vader tried to make a complete break with the man he had once been. Fortunately for Luke and the galaxy, he never truly succeeded.

In retrospect, Anakin's ""death"" on Mustafar may actually have saved the good in him. If Darth Vader had been able to continue being Anakin Skywalker in public just as his Master continued being Emperor Palpatine in public, the persona of Anakin may have become fully corrupted by his evil deeds. By the time of the Empire, no one made a distinction between Darth Sidious and Emperor Palpatine because there *was* no distinction!

But by falling on Mustafar, Darth Vader was essentially forced to put his Anakin Skywalker self in cold storage, where it lay dormant until Luke reactivated it 23 years later. As a result, Ben Kenobi was able to describe Anakin as a good man, while Luke had a cherished image of his father he could look up to. In this way, the goodness in Anakin was successfully preserved until it reemerged aboard the second Death Star.",StarWars,Sith Lords and their attitudes towards dual identities,2306,390,5.912820512820513

TheMastersSkywalker,1614040667,lq4o3d,12,1,"When TFA came out I wasn't sure what Kylo's age was meant to be. In my head I personally thought of him as being younger and closer to the age his grandfather was when he had fallen. Even a few months later when I learned that he was 29 in TFA it didn't really click with me. I don't remember when I learned Rey's age but it was basically the age I assumed 18 or in her case 19.

I didn't really think much about the age gap until TLJ when the shipping wars really started to take off (finnrey vs reylo vs finnpoe vs whatever) and people started putting Rey and Kylo together as romantic interests instead of just protagonist and antagonist. 

And one of the things that stuck out to me was the age difference between the 19 year old Rey and the 29 yr old Kylo. It was also the same  amount of age gap between Han and Leia (Legends even had the age gap at 12 years). So I recently wanted to figure out what it is about the two pairings that makes me ok with the age gap in one case, that of Han and Leia but find it creepy in the other, that being Rey and Kylo. And my conclusion seems to be experience and intent. 

I don't really mean relationship experience as I don't think Kylo really has any more relationship experience than Rey would have unless he did have a relationship with Tai. But even there Han and Leia are equals with both having a number of significant others in their past before meeting each other. 

What I mean by experience is experience with the world/galaxy. Yes Rey grew up as an orphan and had to learn to defend herself, teach herself how to repair things, deal with other people on her planet, etc but even then she is still as sheltered in a way as Luke is. She has never been off planet, she's only seen most of what she has learned through holotapes and games not first hand. She meets some aliens and learns enough trade languages to get by but she isn't say traveling there and learning about them and partaking in their culture. Life to her is a daily struggle for survival. She is missing, or should be missing, a lot of life skills and experiences that those growing up in civilization would get. She's a backwater bumpkin like Luke is. 

Then you have Kylo who is much more experience both as Ben Solo who was raised on Tyferra and went to good schools and diplomatic functions and trips with his parents before joining his Uncles temple and learning even more about cultures and people and traveling to new places. Then as Kylo we have him learning about warfare, killing people, the darkside and the light, all of these other things that gives him a huge deal more life experience than Rey. It seems like some guy who has way more life experience coming in and taking advantage of a person from the countryside who has never left their farm so to speak. Rey is more emotionally mature than Kylo but that's about the only thing she has on him. 

But when it comes to Leia and Han neither one seem more experienced than the other.  Both are well traveled and have been to multiple planets all over the galaxy. Both have held down important jobs and have a wealth of life experiences behind them with Leia being a rebel and senator and Han being a tie pilot and smuggler. Sure Han has 10 years on her but when it comes to what their life has been like and what they have done and where they have went feels pretty equal. Each knows some things the other doesn't and both have a good base in common so it doesn't feel so much like a person who is her elder by a decade taking advantage of her it feels more like a person who knows what she is doing. And both of them seem much more experienced than Luke.

Which brings me to the next part which is intent. Just off the bat the fact that one is a hero while the other is the villain means the intent is different but  lets look at Han. Right off the bat their is snark and flirtatious teasing between him and Leia. Both of them giving as good as they get. and then all through the rest of the movie and ESB (and of course the comics and books) its the same thing. Its not Just Han pushing the issue with no response from Leia its her constantly bantering back or teasing him and this is a character that would be more than capable of telling Han off if she thought he went to far in his advances. We throughout the entire saga know that these are two people who love to argue and banter with each other but have problems being truthful. Sure Han may go a bit to far in the engine room according to how we see things today (and no this isn't excusing anything because ""that's just how it was then"" its just pointing it out that it happened and was considered romantic if it was the right person doing it at the right time) but that is a movie made 40 years ago and looking at TFA it has things we see as problematic today. 

Unlike with Han and Leia we don't see Rey and Kylo bickering and bantering and instead see a large power imbalance. The first time they meet she is frozen in place, knocked out, tied up, then with Kylo standing over her he says ""You know I can take whatever I want""....now maybe I watch to much SVU and cop dramas but my mind goes one place. And speaking of minds he then invades hers  against her will in a way that looks painful to her and scrapes through her memories. 

And here during this moment is where we are told their ""relationship"" starts because while he is getting that information she is also getting his memories of training in how to use the force (explaining her powers in the fight and in TLJ) and his memories of his time before Kylo. 

So she gets to know what he was like before but we don't which doesn't really make some of us feel like their is that connection. Han and Leia showed us time and again they cared. But with Rey and Kylo we are told that they care for each other because of a memories we don't get to see and despite only spending a limited amount of time together. 

So after escaping and killing Han Rey goes to Luke's and will only see Kylo two more time before the hutt scene where she literally puts on makeup and ships herself off in a box to him. Again we don't know what their memories they shared are and they have spent as much time fighting as talking. So she gets on the ship and both try to turn the other to their side and after another fight she refuses and Kylo starts negging her. Negging is where a man starts putting down a woman to make her feel like she needs his acceptance. Rey turns away from him and the darkside. So in two movies we are ""told"" their are feelings and a relationship but not really shown one or if we want to force the elevator and hut scene into romance not shown a healthy one. 

Then we get into TROS where Rey, per canon works, hasn't seen or spoken to Kylo in a year. And while in the movie and book and jr novelization of the movie it says she cares about him it never uses the word love. In fact the Jr novelization and The Star Wars Book and one other source I'm forgetting don't even mention the kiss. But even before the kiss we aren't shown them really having much of a relationship or banter. Its all both trying to turn the other to their side and fighting.

No maybe if Kylo was Rey's age or we got to see more of them together talking or something I would be able to buy into it. But their is so much saying they are in love and not showing it that it makes it hard for me to buy the intent as anything other than a much older darksider trying to turn and take advantage of this younger woman he has a mysterious connection to. 

So TLDR: Han and Leia have a equal amount of experience when it comes to romance and the galaxy and working while Kylo has a lot more than Rey in just about everything but emotional intelligence . Han and Leia also show us in three movies that they like bantering with each other and that while they bicker they really care about each other while Rey and Kylo are constantly trying to turn the other and fighting the other with Kylo acting in ways that feel abusive if they were together. 

Rey does care about him because of the connection they have and the memories but their is more than one kind of love. The Romans had eight different types of love and I think for Rey and Kylo it may have been one of the other seven than romantic love. So this is the reason I've come to on why I feel like their is a difference between the two groupings despite their age that isn't hypocritical",StarWars,To me the difference between Han/Leia and Rey/Kylo's relationships is experience and intent,8419,1615,5.213003095975232

It would be similar to the new ‘Tales Of The Walking Dead’ so that’s coming out except it’s based on the Star Wars Universe.

It would be live-action and there be 6-8 episodes per season. Each episode would focus on a different story or character in the Star Wars Universe. Like an episode based around Darth Vader hunting down a Jedi so we get some post ROTS Vader, an episode about Palpatine’s early days and how he was trained under Plagueis, one about the High Republic, one about Luke’s adventures after ROTJ like that one Battlefront 2 mission, one about Snoke’s origins etc.

The show would show us several different eras of Star Wars and would cover stories that may not have a chance to have their own show or movie.

bears_gm,1614033770,lq27fz,11,1,"This is really just an idea of an expanded SW universe idea I’ve had, it’s not written all that well.. there’s probably a decent chunk of typos, but if you can read and try to follow the story and lmk what you think that’d be great.. I’m expecting some, if not a lot, of hate so if y’all could just try to be not overly harsh that’d be cool.. it’s just a fans idea

I’ve been thinking about ways to expand the SW universe into new canon and a new Saga - throwing out random ideas of how to bring the SW ‘force-users’ to Earth.

So as we know SW takes place a “long time ago, in a galaxy far far away” so the new Saga/era would be present or at the very least somewhat modern dated..

We also know that humans exist in the SW universe, but we don’t know the origin or that species necessarily in terms of their home planet, how they got there, etc.... this part leaves room for creativity 

Anyways, at an attempt to achieve something similar to Marvels MCU in terms of the interlocking storylines and such... An idea I’ve had is something along the lines of a force-user escaping a dark-side controlled SW galaxy and landing on Earth. 

The Dark side would have created a new cutting-edge tech that can now jump outside of their own SW galaxy (for the matter of simplicity it would be the closest neighboring galaxy - which happens to have Earth) to expand their power and control. They’ve already got complete control (like they have in the previous films) but this time, because of this new tech, they are dominating new unchartered worlds outside of their galaxy and expanding their army.

Think of side stories similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/lc81bb/okaythis_is_badass/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

The Jedi that have managed to survive, w/ the exception of less than a few (if any.. obv minor details like this are flexible), have decided they need to either escape simply to survive, to keep the Jedi code alive, or to grow an army to outside of their universe also to prevent the inevitable force of the Dark Side over all life.

So now we’re at Indiana Jones... I haven’t thought this thorough so bare me with me - this is mostly to feel out the general ideas. The image I just keep coming back to is Indiana Jones uncovering a lightsaber from somewhere remote that dates back to the dinosaur days.

Jumping back to the Jedi, all we know is that one of the human Jedi escaped (a storyline that would’ve been covered in a previous film at this point)... so the lightsaber discovery would be the first indication to the fanbase that the human Jedi landed on Earth.

This could open the door to a lot of things that I’d love  to hear peoples opinions on:

• so a force using human-Jedi landed on Earth during Dinosaur days

—&amp;gt; which could playoff the idea that a human Jedi mated (either with a fellow human-Jedi, or just human from the SW universe (possibly a lover) that escaped with he/she) and *now* a super super tiny fraction of the current human species  is prone to having force abilities. 

• Indiana starts uncovering other artifacts within the lightsaber and realizes the Kyber crystal isn’t from this planet and holds all sorts of untapped energy that could be scientifically beneficial (which could lead to other villain stories) - I like the idea of, after a few movies in, he begins to find a common link between between these archaeological stories (aka new Indy movies) either about “some cosmetic energy” that’s a theme in his most recent findings.. the buildup of this excites me - meanwhile, other movies or shows are taking place on Earth at the same time (basically a show about a force user, kinda like how Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Iron man and CA are all taking place) so we get side movies that play off and interlink.. eventually w/ Indy (possibly other heroes, since the idea is to create something like an Avenger-eque crowd) and the modern-day saberless Jedi meet

• This leaves room for what I think could be my favorite part.. Only two current humans, one good - one bad, are force sensitive. Both get their own character development and so on eventually fighting with the light side winning (possibly even converting the other force sensitive) - they could be reached out to thru the force by the first Jedi that landed on Earth to guide their teachings... only because eventually...

• that army the dark side had been gathering for years and terraforming other worlds (which all of this has the potential to have their own movies on, possibly not hinting they’re related, idk) finally reached Earth. Where first they send the Aliens and Predator like creatures to do their killing for them only to be defeated or been resisted by a then Avengers like unit of new SW Saga characters - which I haven’t broadened the scope of in this post, but you can get creative.. new heroes who may possibly have a heightened midichlorian count related to the average human, but still not enough to use the force.. which could heighten IQ, fighting abilities, perhaps gene mutations when exposed to something, idk you get the idea.

• the Thanos moment would be when a dark side user from the SW universe enters the big screen after several movies in. It would be the first time a lightsaber fight will have taken place again between two force users. This Earth born Jedi would become no match. Is suggested to become this Siths new apprentice to rule all of Earth... how it goes from here, I’m not sure but that’s basically the simple storyline

His work is amazing and I'm really looking forward to the finished product, but I don't know which character or scene to use, so I'm looking for recommendations. I'm thinking a Mandalorian or possibly a Jedi, but I am open to pretty much anything. An intense moment with a close-up of a face - maybe in a battle or something similar - would be ideal, but I'm also interested in moments of critical importance for the overall storyline.

Here are a few of my thoughts:

1. I love the epic feeling of Saw Gerrera's death scene. He's not the most important character, but something about this scene gives me the chills. Maybe an image of him in front of the window with the dirt rising due to the energy of the pulse.
2. Obi-Wan's fight with Darth Maul - this has to be one of the most iconic scenes in the whole series.
3. Similarly, Obi-Wan and Anakin's battle with Dooku has always been one of my favorites. I'd have to watch the movies again to figure out if there's a really good shot to use as a painting, though.

bears_gm,1613999306,lpnlgj,0,1,"Title is mostly to catch attention. This is really just an idea of an expanded SW universe idea I’ve had, it’s not written all that well.. there’s probably a decent chunk of typos, but if you can read and try to follow the story and lmk what you think that’d be great.. I’m expecting some, if not a lot, of hate so if y’all could just try to be not overly harsh that’d be cool.. it’s just a fans idea

I’ve been thinking about ways to expand the SW universe into new canon and a new Saga - throwing out random ideas of how to bring the SW ‘force-users’ to Earth.

So as we know SW takes place a “long time ago, in a galaxy far far away” so the new Saga/era would be present or at the very least somewhat modern dated..

We also know that humans exist in the SW universe, but we don’t know the origin or that species necessarily in terms of their home planet, how they got there, etc.... this part leaves room for creativity 

Anyways, at an attempt to achieve something similar to Marvels MCU in terms of the interlocking storylines and such... An idea I’ve had is something along the lines of a force-user escaping a dark-side controlled SW galaxy and landing on Earth. 

The Dark side would have created a new cutting-edge tech that can now jump outside of their own SW galaxy (for the matter of simplicity it would be the closest neighboring galaxy - which happens to have Earth) to expand their power and control. They’ve already got complete control (like they have in the previous films) but this time, because of this new tech, they are dominating new unchartered worlds outside of their galaxy and expanding their army.

Think of side stories similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/lc81bb/okaythis_is_badass/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

The Jedi that have managed to survive, w/ the exception of less than a few (if any.. obv minor details like this are flexible), have decided they need to either escape simply to survive, to keep the Jedi code alive, or to grow an army to outside of their universe also to prevent the inevitable force of the Dark Side over all life.

So now we’re at Indiana Jones... I haven’t thought this thorough so bare me with me - this is mostly to feel out the general ideas. The image I just keep coming back to is Indiana Jones uncovering a lightsaber from somewhere remote that dates back to the dinosaur days.

Jumping back to the Jedi, all we know is that one of the human Jedi escaped (a storyline that would’ve been covered in a previous film at this point)... so the lightsaber discovery would be the first indication to the fanbase that the human Jedi landed on Earth.

This could open the door to a lot of things that I’d love  to hear peoples opinions on:

• so a force using human-Jedi landed on Earth during Dinosaur days

—&amp;gt; which could playoff the idea that a human Jedi mated (either with a fellow human-Jedi, or just human from the SW universe (possibly a lover) that escaped with he/she) and *now* a super super tiny fraction of the current human species  is prone to having force abilities. 

• Indiana starts uncovering other artifacts within the lightsaber and realizes the Kyber crystal isn’t from this planet and holds all sorts of untapped energy that could be scientifically beneficial (which could lead to other villain stories)

• This leaves room for what I think could be my favorite part.. Only two current humans, one good - one bad, are force sensitive. Both get their own character development and so on eventually fighting with the light side winning (possibly even converting the other force sensitive) - they could be reached out to thru the force by the first Jedi that landed on Earth to guide their teachings... only because eventually...

Nythromere,1613971385,lpfzbr,1,1,"Quotes: 

**1)  ""He's more machine now than man; twisted and evil"" Obi-Wan, Episode VI**

Alot of people keep thinking Obi says this in IV and use it as a basing point for ""well how did he know this about Vader ?. . . he must have met with him before ANH"" but it actually happens in ROTJ when Obi is a force ghost. Not only had Kenobi fought Vader since then but so has Luke AND Ahsoka. Ahsoka fought Vader in the Rebels TV show. She also communicates with Yoda during the series which takes prior to episode IV - this can be probable cause that Yoda &amp; Obi-Wan knew about Vader and his cyborg body through Ahsoka before ANH **without** Obi-Wan actually meeting with Vader. 

I would also like to put out there that there could be reasonable grounds that word got out about Vader's cyborg enhancements throughout the galaxy via encounters, battles, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)  ""I sense something. A presence I've not felt since..."" Vader, Episode IV**

This quote is a major talking point for why Vader did meet Obi-Wan AND, the flip-side, why Vader did not meet Obi-Wan - and both sides are not entirely correct (at least regarding to Disney canon). This quote does not necessarily pin-point the last time they met physically or otherwise. HOWEVER, it is HEAVILY implied that he meant their duel on Mustafar.

Some people have said that this quote is maybe referring the twins but that is simply not true. In the next scene of Vader after this quote he has a conversation with Tarkin: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK4sZzoycOc&amp;disable\_polymer=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK4sZzoycOc&amp;disable_polymer=1)

&amp;#x200B;

***Dialogue from the scene:***  

**Vader :** He is here.

**Tarkin :** Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?

V : A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

**T :** Surely he must be dead by now.

**V :** Don't underestimate the Force.

**T :** The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.

*\[answering a comm signal\]* 

**T :** Yes?

**Voice on comm :** We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.

**T :** The Princess? Put all sections on alert.

**V :** Obi-wan is here. The Force is with him.

**T :** If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.

V**:** Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

It is obvious from the dialogue that it was indeed Vader sensing Obi-Wan's presence. Tarkin implies that he thought Obi-Wan died many years ago

&amp;#x200B;

3)  ""**Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the Dark Side! I must obey my master"" Vader, Episode VI**

I have seen lots of people have ask when did Obi-Wan want to turn Vader/Anakin back to the lightside. The answer is very simple; during the ROTS, before Anakin's and Kenobi's duel Kenobi says ""Palpatine is evil"", ""Well, then you are lost"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**4)  ""I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you I was but the learner. Now, I am the master""  Vader,  Episode IV**

Now for the most important quote. ""When I left you**"".** When did he leave Obi-Wan? Well it is Obi-Wan who left Anakin/Vader on Mustafar BUT it is on Mustafar when it is absolutely apparent to Kenobi that Anakin left him and the lightside of the force. It is apparent to **both** of them -""You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you"", "" You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them"", "" I have failed you, Anakin; I have failed you"","" This is the end for you, my master"", ""I hate you"" - It is emotional for both of them. Kenobi losing a brother and Anakin/Vader resenting Obi-Wan ^(and himself). 

It does not make sense for Vader &amp; Obi to meet up after Mustafar and to have Vader to leave him. Infact it was a big concern for Vader to find Kenobi between III &amp; IV. Here is a clip from Rebels: [https://youtu.be/RVJrhYr91Bg](https://youtu.be/RVJrhYr91Bg)

The ""learner"" and ""master"" part just means Obi-Wans tutelage &amp; and mentorship over Anakin. Yes Anakin was a jedi knight, yes Anakin should have gotten the seat on the council as a Master, however, Anakin still had a lot to learn - he did infact lose his duel with Kenobi because he was too arrogant. It can also be looked at like  master=winner of the duel, learner=loser of the duel. Also, masters often sought advice from other masters and being that Kenobi **WAS** Anakin's master as a padawan it makes sense that he used those words in the quote. 

""We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete"". This is an vital part that alot of people leave out of the quote. It has the same meaning, when it is combined with the whole quote, as 'the tables have turned'.

The most key part is the ""at last"" - this indicates he has not seen him (at least not physically) since he was the learner and Kenobi was the master. Some might say that they could meet shortly after the events of episode III when Vader is still learning about the darkside but the series is supposed to take place 10 years after ROTS as per Katherine Kennedy's quote "" Obi-Wan Kenobi' begins 10 years after the dramatic events of 'Revenge of the Sith"" . 

# 'Why is it so important to have Darth Vader and Kenobi NOT meet between ROTS &amp; ANH?'

Because it completely ruins the magic of the *very first* lightsaber fight on screen. Watching the two duke it out knowing that so much rides on the duel, knowing that they haven't fought since Luke was born, knowing that it was a long time coming, is completely essential to the duel. So much weight is added to the scene, why would you want to remove that? It builds on their characters, on who they are  during that time, the choices that they made up to that point. 

If they were to simply write over that then who is to say that they cannot write over *anything else* in any other movie or medium. What's to say that one year from now, five years, decades even - they rewrite your favorite scene. It could be from the prequels or the sequels - doesn't matter. If they rewrite those scenes or even knowing that they could rewrite those scenes in the future, important scenes that define different structures of what makes Star Wars, then what the fuck is the point of having those scenes or having *ANY* scene.

# How I want Obi-Wan and Vader to meet in the Kenobi series

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want them to meet physically, unless it's Kenobi leaning over a corner to look at Vader and say ""Hello there"" to provoke Vader (mostly joking here, *mostly*). What I would like to see is something like Vader sensing or realizing that Obi-Wan is on a Star Destroyer nearby about to make his escape off the ship and Vader frantically flies his Tie into the Star Destroyer's hanger bay, crashing it and jumping out, and then Vader starts a rampaging run towards Obi-Wan - destroying everything in his path, throwing stormtroopers out of the way, ripping through doors and walls with the force just to get to him but somehow old Ben escapes in time. 

If they have to fight, and it looks like they will with Katherine Kennedy's quote "" This will be the rematch of the century"", I hope it is through force visions only.",StarWars,Some Quotes &amp; Facts About the Possibility of Vader &amp; Obi-Wan Physically Meeting up Between Episode III &amp; IV,7258,1287,5.6394716394716395

Lemonwalker-420,1613964466,lpdz5w,29,0,"As the Star Wars universe has expanded a lot of things in the OT either don't make a lot of sense anymore or are simply absent. Hell, the same can also be said to a lesser degree about the PT. Also, due to age and technology, the OT looks pretty out of place compared with everything else.

At this time we have new actors established and generally accepted in the roles of Han, Lando, Chewbacca and with (fingers crossed) Stan Shaw on deck for Luke. The only major role that would need casting is Leia. On top of that, the actors who portrayed Obi-Wan, Anakin and even Owen &amp; Beru are now at the perfect ages to play those characters in the OT era.

So much could be fixed, brought up to date and made to better fit the complete story. Characters that weren't yet thought of in 1977 could be acknowledged if not actually used (Qui-Gon, Ahsoka, Grogu, etc.). Palpatine could be more visible right from the start. Oh, and tell me you wouldn't LOVE to see Ewan &amp; Hayden go at it again on the first Death Star in another furious lightsaber duel.

Because of where we are right now, this is the perfect time to bring the OT up to the present. Doing so wouldn't change or negate the original OT as that will always exist. It would make for a more cohesive and full story.

It would be more action oriented than previous SW rpgs, something more like in the vein of Witcher 3:

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AT5PlpAKo0I](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AT5PlpAKo0I)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You could have a new original character term or even create one yourself from various species and customize them however you like. Maybe start as a padawan or young knight to rationalize the progression in power. The speciliazations from older games could be used for it as well like guardian or consular. There could be various planets to visit to do missions and stuff. Beinn a more contained story would allow them to have freedom of narrative and choice too. A big thing in RPGs is to influence the outcome. In star wars that would be a  it difficult since in the grand scheme of things we k how how things play out but in a smaller conflict the devs would still have he freedom to implement choices that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

The story would not be some grand universe-changing thing, but more scaled down self-contained  without interfering with the main narrative of the films or Clone wars.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be interesting to explore the era and setting with someone else other than the main heroes and get many perspectives from various groups and people that would not be easy to do in 20-minute episodes in a kids tv series.

&amp;#x200B;

The main conflict could still be against the evil separatists but there could be gray areas too. For example invading other planets for being seperatist and examining how they may not  want Republic governance over them. Maybe some portion of the population do but others not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

As an RPG your Jedi character will also have diplomatic options to solve conflicts which fit the concept of the Jedi more  instead of just fighting.

&amp;#x200B;

The Clone Wars were explored in the TV show but I feel there is still room for more insight into the era and the conflict especially from other characters too, Jedi and non Jedi.

The way I see it going is they meet have a rematch but this time Vader get the better of Obi and has him where he can kill him but will let’s him go, hence the ‘you should not have come back’ and also keeps in with the fact that there was always good in Anakin, Sorry if this turns out to be a spoiler lol but god I’m so ready for this show.

1,"1. Ever notice how the Enterprise on TNG as a lot of carpeting. Wouldn't all that carpeting cause static electricity; which wouldn't be ideal on a starship. 

2. Is it ever explained why everybody speaks English ? Is there some sort of universal translator?

3. Q is the Star Trek equivalent of the Master from Doctor Who and Loki from the MCU."
1,"Well, I know who he is, but I am more of a TNG fan and just started watching TOS all the way through. I finally got to the Space Seed episode where they introduced Khan! I screamed out loud, pretty cool.

Question though - he said he was Khan Noonian Soong. I know he is a superman. Is he ""related to"" Soong/Data's dad? How do they connect?"
1,"All the criticism of LD seems to come from people more angry at the format than the content. They want TOS-VOY style Star Trek where there are intellectual concepts, moral questions and exploration.

So when LD comes along with a bunch of jokes and references, they lose their minds. Why isn’t so-and-so court martialed? Why aren’t they taking this situation seriously? What about the Prime Directive and? Etc etc.

They don’t seem to understand that LD is a comedy, almost a sitcom really.

First, the show is NOT CANON, it’s semi-canon. There is a bit of cartoon logic. The entire point of the show is “wouldn’t it be funny if behind the scenes of all the Star Trek shows all this silliness happens, like Buffer time being a policy.” It reads like a fun discussion between hardcore trekkies. 

You guys keep complaining about being not acting real-life starfleet. Yet trekkies have the same discussion with their friends all the time. “Hey wouldn’t it be funny to go back to one of the weird planets from TOS?” “Do you think people have sex fantasies in the Holodeck?” “Do you think the lower deck workers have their own adventures in the background while the Bridge crew is doing their stuff?” The entire point of the show is to embody all those fun ideas.

It’s almost like Star Trek: Omake."
1,"That opening sequence. The casting. The sheer energy. The score. The designs. The effects. The cinematography— lens flares included! The whole thing being built around a Kirk/Spock tsundere bromance. The faithful update of the uniforms. The throwback sound effects. A return to the colourful, swashbuckling nature of TOS. Action that actually competes with other blockbuster movies after all this time. A REVENGE plot that involves TIME TRAVEL and ALTERNATE UNIVERSES. 

Seriously, I’m rewatching this movie now and I cannot understand how it’s not more widely accepted within the fandom as a truly great *Trek* movie. It is so damn good. And to hate on this movie hot on the heels of *Nemesis*? Make it make sense."
1,"Hey guys, i've been following the develpment of NFTs (non fungible tokens) which can be a form of digital collectibles. There's a company called Ecomi, which has an app called Veve which allows users to collect digital collectibles, and then trade them between the app's users. I love Star trek, and the website [https://www.veve.me/](https://www.veve.me/) claims to have (through an image on the main page) a deal going on with Star Trek (the next generation). 

Have any of you heard anything about this and do you know when they are set to be released? I can't seem to find any info and I definetely want to check it out once they are released.

Thanks for your help, live long and prosper!"

1,"I personally think that the Orville is quite good, even though I only have ENT Season 1 and 2 as reference. I feel like ENT is overall the better show. The Orville has a few very great episodes, but there are episodes we could not even complete and Season 2 gets really bad towards the end (after the amazing two parter in the middle that was so good that at first we thought it was a season finale!)

I want to see what your thoughts on THE ORVILLE are, espacially to the more experienced treekies out there (I mean I currently only saw ENT Season 1 and 2 and about three episodes TOS)"
0,"The dark side of the force is stated to have immense (UNLIMITED!) power, and even though it's associated with negative emotions and evil characters, I wonder if it can be used for good. It's apparently powerful enough to prevent people from dying if the stuff about Darth Plagueis is true. I think that could definitely be used for good, and I wonder if the dark side has powers similar to it.

Also, the mere fact that the dark side requires negative emotions in order to be used does not necessarily mean that it can't bring about positive results.

What do you all think? Can the dark side be used for good?"
1,"I'm currently re-watching DS9 and I am absolutely loving Rom, he's a good father, funny and so knowledgeable about engineering, I'm on season 4 at the moment and he's just flown to Earth to deliver Nog to Starfleet academy and rescued them all from the 1940s and then in another episode rescued the main crew from a holosuite malfunction. 

I also loved Barclay, of TNG, I think I would have been his friend"
1,Whenever someone visits Troi she tells them something they already know and never really provides any information other than psychoanalyzing them. When someone goes to see Guinan she says something deep in a relatable way and makes the person think about something in a new way. Plus she gives you food and drinks.

0,"I wrote a bit of a fanfiction once that was basically the new hope, but with Luke and Leia chasing down the rebellion. I am think of rewriting it and it made me wonder if there was any actual alternate universe stories.

So my story opened with the same as New Hope but with Bail Organa on the rebel ship with Leia, by the way has the gunner executed for not shooting the pod. Luke takes Bail back to the death star while Leia tracks down the droids.

Finds the Lars homestead and her grandmother's grave, the thing is Padme's family is with the royal court but Anakin's side is just forgotten. So Leia tracks down the droids and runs into Obi-Wan. I until recently realized there would be an issue, since Anakin would kill been, so maybe Padme convinces Anakin to spare him.

That's is about all I had. While the rebellion is running around fighting, Padme is basically trying to mitigate what Anakin is doing. Which is relatively easy since she is running what is left of the Imperial Senate, but they still have no power but she can leverage some stuff with Anakin. Luke and Leia have a rivalry of sorts, but Luke takes after Padme and Leia after Anakin.

Also if I do write more, where on reddit would I post it...I don't think I can here."
1,I wonder if Zefram Cochrane or Lily Sloane has been born yet?
1,"I love the Suder storyline in voyager, short but very effective and gives Tuvok, one of the most boring characters, a really good story arch. Plus Brad Dourif is always so good, he’s over qualified for the role. 


But one issue I find is that &lt;!by mindmelding with Tuvok, he gains empathy and regrets his actions. 

All good, that would make sense for a human, but he is a betazoid! If people can read other people’s minds and such wouldn’t betazoids be more inclined to feel empathy? Wouldn’t they already feel other peoples pain? I mean didn’t Troi almost kill herself because of that? But he didn’t feel anything? 

I guess he could just feel overwhelmed and that was why, but it changes a lot of his story. !&gt; 

Yeah, as I said, very minor issue but it does bug me. I also wouldn’t be surprised if I missed something simple with betaziods, like only the females can read minds or something..."

Why did the Klingons name their military branch ""Defense Forces""?  For one, it sounds very euphemistic and un-Klingon, and two, as we've seen time and again even in the 24th century, they seem quite a bit more offense-oriented than defense.  They are *Klingons*, after all.   Any ideas?

0,"I bought Republic Commando the other night on Playstation, and it was a pretty fun experience. I had been waiting for nearly years to find Republic Commando somewhere, ever since I saw the trailer for it in the extras section of the OG Battlefront. I don't think it's quite as good as a lot of people say it is, I was honestly starting to get a little disappointed a short way into the second section of the game. But I still thought that on the whole, it's a solid piece of work that is a blast to play. 

So now onto the reason I'm writing this post: I'd love to see Republic Commando remade with today's technology, with Dee Bradly Baker AND Temura Morrison on voice acting. Keep Temura on 38, but replace the other three Deltas with Dee. The reason being, I didn't like the voices for the other three Commandos because they didn't feel like clones, they just felt like normal human troopers outfitted with Katarn armor. No one else could play 38 as well as Temura, and Dee is exceptionally gifted with giving individual troopers their own personality through their voice. He exhibits this exceptionally well in the characters of Captain Rex and Commander Cody: while Rex is still a very serious and very strict clone, he's much more casual than Cody and when he speaks it's a lot more relaxed than Cody. Cody on the other hand, always speaks with an official and formal tone of voice, and is much more strict about regulation than Rex. When you listen to them side by side, even though they have the same voice, you know whose voice is whose. That would be perfect for the Deltas, and Dee would absolutely be able to keep their personalities intact while also restoring the idea that they're clones, not truly individuals. 

Another thing I'd add is the ability to assign certain clones to certain maneuvers, and make it so that they're best in their specialty maneuvers and just okay in others. For example, Sev is the sniper and sharpshooter of the team. Give Sev 100% accuracy in sniping positions, and give the others 70-80% accuracy in those same positions. Scorch is the demolitions expert, so make it so that when he sets a demo charge it only takes ten seconds, but when the others do it make it take 20-25 seconds. Essentially what I'm saying is make it matter which Commando I put in which firing position or assign to blow up the wall blocking our path. This way, their specialties mean something and aren't flavor text. 

And finally, the main reason why I would love this remake, is make it so that instead of dozens of loading screens that don't tell me if I finished a section or if the level ended, create cut scenes that either begin or finish the levels so that I know when I'm starting a new level in the mission or if I only finished a section. Or, remove the sections entirely and create smooth transitions from one section to the next instead of jarringly being dumped into and out of loading screens when the sets need to change. 

Final note: having more weapons to pick up would be nice too, I didn't like any of the weapons I was able to pick up from enemies and I never used them except when I could avoid using the garbage DC-15S, which I would also like to have overhauled."

* The whole story of ""The Masterpiece Society"" kinda skims over one of the reasons Eugenics doesn't work: genetic mutation and degredation due to a limited gene pool. Even with gene editing, the colony would only last so many generations before collapse either way.
* ""Darmok"" definitely lived up to the hype! Maybe it should be shown to parents who have more than one teen these days - we have all at least once managed to convey an idea or short message by simply referencing a meme...
* Riker's response at the end of ""Conundrum"" to seeing his main love interest sitting and drinking with his most recent fling was perfect!
* 'I, Borg"" really struck me with The Feels. Kill them with kindness indeed...
* ""Cause and Effect"" should definitely be added to a storytelling Hall of Fame. Brilliantly done, especially each repeat being just so slightly different enough that it wasn't dull to watch over again.
* Picard may not be a fan of kids but he makes a good father figure all the same. (""Disaster"" mainly, though it has been true of the whole show so far.)

0,Perhaps I've just listened to it too many times loud and with headphones. But the entire album has a audible background fuzzy hiss that can at times be even louder than the softest music! It's present on the Spotify versions as well so it's part of the original track sound. I've always been curious how such a quality problem persisted in a high profile release such as that.

0,"I don’t care if I get heat for this. It was funny for a time, but it’s just more often than not not really fun anymore. I mean they could be doing so much more with the bad guys, but they just keep using the same old jokes. They did it in every season of Rebels, they did in Star Wars Resistance, The Mandalorian, Sequel Trilogy.. At this point it just feels lazy. Am I the only one that wants more from Star Wars aside from just reused jokes? Not saying stormtroopers or the empire in general need to be the most competent and deadly bad guys ever, but maybe just change things up every now and then? Why limit ourselves when it comes to storytelling."
1,"...Damar :'(

Obviously I have a lot of thoughts and feelings in general but for some reason the death of Damar really hit me hard. I feel like I got super attached to his character in such a short space of time and was really pulling for him and then he was just...gone. I would have liked to see him as the leader of a new Cardassia :(

On the other hand, I wasn’t sad to see Odo go off to join the great link, never really liked him and Kira together 🤭"
1,"They did this last year with Lower Decks and Discovery, giving us 23 straight weeks of new Trek. Based on what we know today, it stands to reason that they will do this again. Which would put the release dates:

Discovery: October 21st, 13 episodes.
Picard: January 20th, 2022, 10 episodes.
Strange New Worlds: March 31st, 2022, 10 episodes.

This is just speculation, I know, but they stated they wanted to do near continuous new Trek before the pandemic. Now it seems they can accomplish that goal. Perhaps after a summer break this could be the yearly rotation for years to come.

0,"Note: This was originally a comment I posted in the recent [r/StarWarsLeaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/) megathread, but I expand on that comment in this post. And if you'd rather watch a recap of my post, Kessel Run Transmissions (the guys who leaked we'd get a Bad Batch show months before it was announced!) uploaded a [video of what I go over](https://youtu.be/Vi3H1TbTt0o) in my original comment!

I was having my daily viewing of The Bad Batch sizzle reel (as one does) a while ago and I can now confidently say that the Bad Batch will meet Saw Gerrera, and possibly even Lux Bonteri, in ""the siege at Onderon."" I can also confidently say that Fennec Shand will be on Pantora, the Bad Batch (or at least Wrecker) will be on Saleucami at some point, which leads me to believe Cut Lawquane (the deserter clone that Rex meets in The Clone Wars) and his family will make an appearance, and there will be some Mandalore-related episode(s). My evidence:

* A ""siege at Onderon"" was actually teased back in The Clone Wars S7: E9 ""Old Friends Not Forgotten."" During the Battle of Yerbana, Admiral Yularen lets Anakin know that they've received a transmission from someone using Anakin's subspace frequency Fulcrum. Anakin thinks it's Saw Gerrera to which Obi-Wan replies ""Perhaps the siege at Onderon has taken a turn for the worse."" Why would the Separatists go back to Onderon? Well, I think we might find out and see a part of this siege because [The Bad Batch sizzle reel provides just enough evidence to confirm the Bad Batch will be on Onderon](https://imgur.com/a/rTEknzE). It looks like Onderon rebels are still fighting and where there are Onderon rebels, one can find Saw Gerrera. Lux Bonteri would be a senator representing Onderon at this point so he might make an appearance as well.
* We already know Fennec Shand will be in The Bad Batch, but I think she will definitely appear on Pantora. [There's a shot in the sizzle reel that shows Hunter on a speeder on what is for sure Pantora, and in the background, there's a person on the ledge of a tower holding onto another person hanging off the tower.](https://imgur.com/a/0x32jDn) If you zoom in, you can see the person on the ledge appears to have a red helmet on their head and the rest of their fit is black, just like Fennec (might need desktop to see). I have no clue who the person she's holding onto could be though.
* The part in the sizzle reel where Wrecker has a farmer fit on and he's bonking three clones is on Saleucami. [The background provides just enough evidence.](https://imgur.com/a/vSU5wgz) And where there's a farm, there's usually a farmer which leads me to believe the Bad Batch (or at least just Wrecker) will meet Cut Lawquane and his family.
* I decided to include this in the hopes that one of you can help identify this [unknown person ducking next to Hunter.](https://imgur.com/a/Xm7XhSS) It looks like Hunter and the rest of the squad are protecting him. The person's hair looks white in the screenshots, but if you watch the sizzle reel at the slowest speed, you can see that his hair actually seems more blonde. Also, it's hard to make out, but the person appears to have a red patch on their sleeve. I highly doubt it's him, but could this person be Korkie Kryze, nephew of Satine and Bo-Katan? I didn't come up with this, but everyone I've asked (admittedly only 2 people) thinks he's Korkie. I personally don't see it, the hairstyle is different, as Korkie's hair is more slicked back. The location looks similar to the Saleucami base Wrecker is in, so could that be Cut instead? Maybe he changed his hair color, but I doubt that's him too. Korkie's last appearance was in The Clone Wars S5: E16 ""The Lawless"" where he got knocked out by one of Maul's Mandalorians. However, later in the episode, when Satine is recaptured, Almec tells Maul that ""Satine's accomplices have escaped,"" so Korkie at least survived that episode. Again, I doubt that specific person is Korkie, but it wouldn't be far-fetched for him to appear.
* Speaking of Mandalorians, [it looks like the Bad Batch will be going to Concordia](https://imgur.com/a/Tvt2GAs), which is a moon of Mandalore and where Death Watch used to have a base. Perhaps we will see Bo-Katan being ousted out of power by Gar Saxon because he was made Viceroy of Mandalore by the Empire when Bo-Katan didn't want to do the Empire's bidding.
* I didn't forget about Bracca, Zygerria, etc., but those are more obvious they'll be in the series.

Final thoughts: Thinking story-wise, it seems reasonable the Bad Batch will meet these characters as they face a tough decision : what life to choose as they ""struggle to stay afloat and find new purpose"" ([from the official synopsis](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-bad-batch-series-announce)) in the post-Clone Wars era. Will they decide to directly fight injustice (like Saw, Lux, Korkie, and Bo-Katan), become mercenaries making their way through the galaxy (like Fennec), or walk away from it all and settle down to a simple life (like Cut)? Thanks for reading!"
0,"  I am end of the season 2 and I just wanna ask that why jedi’s are powerless in this show. like when they got surrounded by the couple of droid they just like yield and when someone tries to escape from a jedi he or she just runs away and that makes me so mad like we’ve seen kylo ren stopped a blast laser in mid air and freezed the shooter while not looking. Hondo Ohnaka takes hostage Anakin, obi wan and frickin count dooku and he gots away with it ffs. General Griveous plays jedi’s like they are normal human being.

1,"In S1E6 ""Q-Less"" Vash mistakenly says ""refrac*tion* index"" when she means to say ""refrac*tive* index"" in relation to the crystal from the gamma quadrant. I find it unlikely that an actress like Jennifer Herrick, the writers, producers, editors etc. could have all overlooked this if it was a mistake, which leaves me wondering if the Vash character is meant to be unintelligent? Just a simple adventurer stealing artifacts of which she has almost no understanding? How could Picard fall in love with such a person? Is there any evidence of Vash being intelligent?"
1,"Hi everyone. I just felt like I needed to post here, not for your sake, but for mine. I don’t know much about Star Trek, but I finally thought I’d give it a shot (with a name like ‘Khan’ I was turned off to the franchise due to people yelling “Khhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan” at me all to often growing up). I have seen two and a half movies prior to actually watching this episode (Star Trek 2009, Into Darkness, and half of Wrath of Khan), but this is by far the most enjoyable experience I’ve had with the franchise.

After much thought I decided I would start off with The Next Generation, for a few main reasons. First of all was the fact that TNG seems to have a lot of gravity in the community, and secondly I think Patrick Stewert is a great actor.... and I have to admit I actually really enjoyed it. 

I don’t know too much about the series, but I knew a lot of the basics/memes going into it. A couple thoughts I have had:

I hope Wesley doesn’t become a marry sue, but my hopes aren’t all to high since he seemed to know everything about the captain’s chair before he ever sat in it. 

Q kinda seems like a dick tbh. Like I know he’s a reacquiring character and everything, but all he seems to want to do is be a jerk to the Enterprise specifically.

Ryker feels like some sort of Kirk 2.0, all while being someone totally new and different than the Kirk I knew from the movies. He gives off a “Yeah I’m pretty dope and I know it” vibe at the same time he gives off a “Yeah I have more to learn from this older captain” vibe as well.

I thought Worf and Geordi played larger roles in the ship going into it, but they both seem like interesting characters nonetheless.

I’m kinda curious about Picard and Dr. Crusher’s history together, seems like it could be an interesting plot point. 

Anyway, that’s my ramble for the night. If enough people seem interested in my journey through TNG I might post an update or two as I learn more about the world/story. Thanks for reading, and have a good night! (or morning, depending on where you are)"
0,If your looking for relatively good budget lightsabers go ahead and look for the $32.99 I have 4 of them now and for budget cosplay and cheeky messing around those are the ones for you!
1,"I love Star Trek. It’s quality sci-fi that’s hopeful, funny, poignant, and has been mostly well done on big &amp; small screen. What I feel has been lacking is good games for Star Trek (especially the last few years). They’re either half baked, money grabs, or Star Trek Online which is good but I don’t have MMO time any more.

So I saw Star Trek: Legends in Apple Arcade I was all for it for one simple thing: no IAPs. So how would this play out? Well I have to say, if you took a game built with IAPs and then removed them, this is what you would have. So what do I mean? Well you still have ‘the grind,’ you have timed quests that increase in length as you progress, and you still have lots of random rewarding. You even still have a ‘store.’

What you don’t have is a way to skip, speed up, or specify things by buying. How much time you put in (and a bit how the RNG gods treat you) decide your growth.

I’m now up to level 40 with my prime crew at ~3k power and I’m enjoying it. I’ve hit some grindy spots, but I’m also not worried about being horrifically left in the dust, I can see how much time I can put in and what rewards that will get me, and I also know that I’m not going to be annoyed that I can’t compete with people cause they spend $$$ on things. I’m gonna be happy where I’m at.

I also enjoy that (so far) PvP is just a way to do more stuff, not required for growth.

I REALLY enjoy this model. I’m hoping this isn’t a one-time thing. I see NBA2K and I think “oh maybe this is the turning of the tide.”

I enjoy playing games like this but always avoid it because it is either a money trap or a annoyance because I don’t want to spend money.

To get this done: if you like Star Trek, get this. It isn’t breaking any ground for story (honestly it’s rehashed) but it is hopefully laying groundwork for greater things and I want to encourage that. There are bugs and foibles and areas for growth and improvement, and I hope to see the bugs fixed and the growth realized. If it happens, I think I’ll be playing this for quite some time.

1,"So not sure if this has been answered somewhere, but i have a question about the scenes during the Battle of Chin’toka (although this inquiry can probably be said about a lot of battle scenes).

The federation, Klingon, and Romulan forces took heavy damage and it showed. The Cardassian weapon platforms struck the ships and you could see instant visible damage in most cases. One platform even fired a couple shots and destroyed an Akira-class ship in seconds with another platform cutting a hole through a Galaxy-class ship! Then other things happened like Jem’hadar ships hitting the Klingons and tearing 15 ships apart in minutes. 

So my question i guess is - where are their shields!? I mean, we know they have them. But how come the weapon platforms could so easily destroy all those ships and we not see any shield impacts? Its like they didn’t even have them! 

And i know the weapon platforms themselves had regenerative shields, cause we also saw those take hits and respond. But the alliance ships only saw damage and explosions, so how come?"
1,"According to the opening monologue, the Enterprise (NCC-1701) is tasked with the following:

*""It's five year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""*

But often is it actually ordered to do so? And how often is it not? Let's find out. I wanted  to create a list of all types of missions Enterprise was specifically tasked with over the 79 episodes on TOS. Now, keep in mind that most of these are only introduced to be forgotten after the first few minutes of the episode, because of the adventure of the week they're stumbling into. This list counts what they were *supposed* to do, not what they ended up doing for most of the episode.

There may be some confusion over what I considered **known** and **unknown planets**. To clarify: A known planet is a planet with atleast one human/Federation citizen already present and/or obvious previously established relations.

I think it's kinda interesting how evenly spread the reasons for the ship being somewhere are. 4 Distress calls per season. No more, no less. It's almost like someone kept count and tried not make something repeat all to often."
1,"So I started watching TOS, TNG and the Kelvin movies in October, and I fell in love with the saga, but I didn't usually check the Star Trek subreddits because I always thought the fanbase was going to be full of people complaining about more recent ST series and films, but it's quite the opposite!

I see a lot of people loving Quinto's and Peck's Spocks, and Discovery, and accepting the diversity of the new shows. It's awesome! I wish I joined this community sooner.

Of course there are some people who don't like the new series, but that's okay! Everyone is friendly and they all respect each other's opinion. Oh man, I wish other fanbases were like this one.

Although YouTube looks particulary toxic, not sure why.

1,"In many TOS episodes, there are occasions of the enterprise being able to leave our galaxy and achieve very far travel relative to TNG era ships. Possibly in that era, warp was calculated based on a different formula, but maximum speeds caused a sort of breakdown of subspace or somehow altering the constitution of the universe, causing a mass re-tuning of maximum safe speeds.. and also supra-warp speeds could also have been very economically unsound

Plausible?"
1,Live action Lower Decks. All the voice actors in their regular roles. Anyone who voices multiple roles still acts them just with different costume/makeup. External Cerritos shots could still all be the original animation style.
0,"In the past I’ve only watched the films. When the sequels came out I was quite happy with Luke’s portrayal. But after reading the legends New Jedi Order books, I was like WTF, the films actually give him a huge disservice regarding what he could actually been like!"
0,"I love virtually everything in the Star Wars canon. I dislike a few animated episodes here and there but I love the OT, the prequels, RO, Solo, TFA, TLJ, CW, Rebels, and the Mandalorian. I disliked some of the newer entries when I first saw them but quickly grew to enjoy them and saw how each one contributed to the overarching story of SW. 

The only exception is TROS. After more than a year since its release and despite repeated viewings and even after studying background info in sources like the Visual Dictionary, Episode 9 still feels like a disappointing and jarring departure from the rest of the story. It feels like a feature-length retcon of the saga and constantly reminds me that the ST had no preconceived plan or arc, even though it was meant to conclude a single cohesive story.

Still, I want to like this movie, and I know there are people out there who enjoy it. Is there a Star Wars apologist out there who can help me let go of my hate? Is there any source you have found that satisfactorily justifies things like Palpatine’s return, the hidden Sith fleet, force-resurrection powers, and other retcon-type stuff that feels out of step with the rest of SW mythology? Thanks in advance!"

0,"I mean it spells it out for you in the movies, and the events that occurred logically lead to Luke's behavior. I mean, after seeing what Anakin did after turning to the dark side, then having his apprentice, Ben, also turn, what do you expect him to do? If you seriously thought Luke should have remained the exact same, you don't know how things work. Ben turning shook him up, which makes him shutting himself off from the Force and everybody make a decent amount of sense."

I'm thinking Master &amp; Apprentice to start, and sticking mostly with the canon novels for now, and maybe some of the film adaptions from legends, but idk..."
0,"I’ll go first. Matt Lanter in Clone Wars. I’ve heard all the defenses of his work but he’s not right for the role. What do yall think, who would you recast?"
1,"I love Disco and Picard for their season-long stories. It makes the tale more immersive and I can't wait for the next installment. Episodic is easier to watch casually and sure you can miss one here or there and not be lost, but I don't know why that's a thing that matters so much to folks. As if all Star Trek should be told the same way or something.

Anyway, I see these discussions repeatedly in the comments and I don't get it. I like the diversity of story-telling. I like having a story I have to follow, that is more complex, that can't be contained in 50 minutes. Star Trek deserves to feel epic. 

I like one-off episodes too, don't get me wrong. They're great for a break in the main storyline. But some of my favorite episodes of TNG, VOY, DS9 were the mini-arcs. I always wished there were more of them and that they were longer.

There's value in all the various story-telling methods and I'm really glad Star Trek isn't sticking to one format."

Did he delegate to a representative perhaps?

The artwork used isn't mine, I found them across various forums and image boards. So for that reason I wont be sharing the actual files as I don't want to steal from someone else's work.

1,I've only seen Star Trek Lower Decks and I don't know what order I should be watching Star Trek proper if you will. Should I start with the newer movies or one of the shows before them? Kirk or Picard? All that stuff. Thanks in advance.
1,"Situation, you are a warp capable civilization in Star Trek, maybe even part of the Federation.  Suddenly, WHAM!  Megadisaster! You’re thrown back to the Iron Age, Stone Age, whatever.

Questions, how does the Prime Directive now apply to you?

Initially, you still have knowledge of warp technologies and civilizations so does the Federation help you or ignore you because of The Prime Directive?

How much time has to pass before The Prime Directive does come into effect on your world?  After one generation of no warp capabilities?  Two, three?"
0,"The year was 1999, around my 10th birthday. I was having a birthday party at my house, Star Wars themed of course, the phantom menace just release in theaters and it was a huge deal for me and many others. Before then, all I had was the original trilogy on laser disc that I wanted more times then anything else in my 10 years of life. 

The party was great I remember, we had a lot of fun and when it came to present time I got plenty of Star Wars stuff to hold me over for the next 3 days. Then came the surprise present, which was that we were going to see the new movie that night. As a 10 year old, this is a solid moment to excuse shitting your own pants in excitement. At this announcement, another kid was very excited and that he had an announcement of his own! He told us that he already saw it, and that Qui-Gon dies in the end. The room was silent as we all stared at the kid, dumbfounded by what he just said. He ruined the ending of the movie for everyone in the room, and I remember it clearly 21 years later, to the point that every time I think of this movie, I remember my 10th birthday, and how it changed how I view this movie for the rest of my life.

Thanks kid."

1,"Kes and Neelix are both problematic characters in different ways.  I tend to think that Neelix eventually got to be sorta decent, but that relationship is insane!  Even with the argument that Ocampans age faster and Kes is an “adult,” she is still a very young adult (like human equivalent of an 18-year-old).  And later, she gets married to Tom in an alternate future and they have a kid who marries Harry Kim!  

Trek is a little weird sometimes and I know it’s about accepting other cultures but this seems really odd. Kes and Neelix couldn’t even have known each other longer than a couple of months and who knows how “mature” she was when they met.  I honestly can’t get over how he seems to be in a relationship with a child that he groomed."

0,"This is really just an idea of an expanded SW universe idea I’ve had, it’s not written all that well.. there’s probably a decent chunk of typos, but if you can read and try to follow the story and lmk what you think that’d be great.. I’m expecting some, if not a lot, of hate so if y’all could just try to be not overly harsh that’d be cool.. it’s just a fans idea

I’ve been thinking about ways to expand the SW universe into new canon and a new Saga - throwing out random ideas of how to bring the SW ‘force-users’ to Earth.

So as we know SW takes place a “long time ago, in a galaxy far far away” so the new Saga/era would be present or at the very least somewhat modern dated..

We also know that humans exist in the SW universe, but we don’t know the origin or that species necessarily in terms of their home planet, how they got there, etc.... this part leaves room for creativity 

Anyways, at an attempt to achieve something similar to Marvels MCU in terms of the interlocking storylines and such... An idea I’ve had is something along the lines of a force-user escaping a dark-side controlled SW galaxy and landing on Earth. 

The Dark side would have created a new cutting-edge tech that can now jump outside of their own SW galaxy (for the matter of simplicity it would be the closest neighboring galaxy - which happens to have Earth) to expand their power and control. They’ve already got complete control (like they have in the previous films) but this time, because of this new tech, they are dominating new unchartered worlds outside of their galaxy and expanding their army.

Think of side stories similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/lc81bb/okaythis_is_badass/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

The Jedi that have managed to survive, w/ the exception of less than a few (if any.. obv minor details like this are flexible), have decided they need to either escape simply to survive, to keep the Jedi code alive, or to grow an army to outside of their universe also to prevent the inevitable force of the Dark Side over all life.

So now we’re at Indiana Jones... I haven’t thought this thorough so bare me with me - this is mostly to feel out the general ideas. The image I just keep coming back to is Indiana Jones uncovering a lightsaber from somewhere remote that dates back to the dinosaur days.

Jumping back to the Jedi, all we know is that one of the human Jedi escaped (a storyline that would’ve been covered in a previous film at this point)... so the lightsaber discovery would be the first indication to the fanbase that the human Jedi landed on Earth.

This could open the door to a lot of things that I’d love  to hear peoples opinions on:

• so a force using human-Jedi landed on Earth during Dinosaur days

—&amp;gt; which could playoff the idea that a human Jedi mated (either with a fellow human-Jedi, or just human from the SW universe (possibly a lover) that escaped with he/she) and *now* a super super tiny fraction of the current human species  is prone to having force abilities. 

• Indiana starts uncovering other artifacts within the lightsaber and realizes the Kyber crystal isn’t from this planet and holds all sorts of untapped energy that could be scientifically beneficial (which could lead to other villain stories) - I like the idea of, after a few movies in, he begins to find a common link between between these archaeological stories (aka new Indy movies) either about “some cosmetic energy” that’s a theme in his most recent findings.. the buildup of this excites me - meanwhile, other movies or shows are taking place on Earth at the same time (basically a show about a force user, kinda like how Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Iron man and CA are all taking place) so we get side movies that play off and interlink.. eventually w/ Indy (possibly other heroes, since the idea is to create something like an Avenger-eque crowd) and the modern-day saberless Jedi meet

• This leaves room for what I think could be my favorite part.. Only two current humans, one good - one bad, are force sensitive. Both get their own character development and so on eventually fighting with the light side winning (possibly even converting the other force sensitive) - they could be reached out to thru the force by the first Jedi that landed on Earth to guide their teachings... only because eventually...

• that army the dark side had been gathering for years and terraforming other worlds (which all of this has the potential to have their own movies on, possibly not hinting they’re related, idk) finally reached Earth. Where first they send the Aliens and Predator like creatures to do their killing for them only to be defeated or been resisted by a then Avengers like unit of new SW Saga characters - which I haven’t broadened the scope of in this post, but you can get creative.. new heroes who may possibly have a heightened midichlorian count related to the average human, but still not enough to use the force.. which could heighten IQ, fighting abilities, perhaps gene mutations when exposed to something, idk you get the idea.

• the Thanos moment would be when a dark side user from the SW universe enters the big screen after several movies in. It would be the first time a lightsaber fight will have taken place again between two force users. This Earth born Jedi would become no match. Is suggested to become this Siths new apprentice to rule all of Earth... how it goes from here, I’m not sure but that’s basically the simple storyline



If you’ve stuck around this long, ty

I’ve had this idea for a little while, still haven’t been able to articulate it all that well but I got tired of waiting and wanted to share it.. if there’s a couple people that take it well, I’ll consider thinking it out a little better and shaping it up in an easier to read way

E: Oh, and Indiana Jones would be played by Robert Downey, who would found some new overseeing branch or team, essentially being the founder of the SW avenger like team - you can’t tell me he wouldn’t make a great Indy either

E2: the lightsaber discovery could be at one of the Great pyramids or Mayan temples, which in future movies is revealed to be a Jedi Temple"

The most frequent complaint I’ve seen is that starkiller is OP which I don’t get, he trained for most of his life and the biggest feat he did was pull a Star destroyer out of the sky which doesn’t seem OP to me since yoda said it doesn’t matter how big something is. Plus he &gt;!died at the end!&lt; The only thing I didn’t like about the whole game was the fact that the rebellion formed by Vader’s plan going wrong. If you didn’t like the game or had a problem with it what was the problem specifically? 

I’m not trying to defend it or say any opinion is wrong I just don’t get most complaints I’ve seen and am asking for someone to break it down for me. Thanks."
1,"We’ve got Prime, Mirror, and Kelvin universes to play in (at least, I’m sure there are a few others but those are the main ones I know/think of), and while I know most people just want future Prime adventures, with the number of Trek shows we have now I think it’s be cool to explore an alternate timeline."
1,"I know Micheal Dorn has been trying to sell this idea for a long time. I'm just not sure why it hasn't materialized in some form? 

A long-running series might not be justified, but it doesn't even appear that there are any serious talks about a limited streaming series now that DSC and PIC have been established. 

Personally, I think Worf's arc was basically complete by the end of DS9, so I don't NEED to see more. But I also would enjoy a cameo, at least, or even a Klingon-centric series with Worf as our viewpoint character. 

I mean, I don't know what CBS is thinking - you have a legacy actor willing to come in 4 hours early to put all that crap on his face to make a series that will be an instant success because everyone loves Worf. I don't get the resistance."

1,"Rewatching Voyager's Warlord got me thinking...

Story-heavy, crucial spoilers ahead 

And it's a minor quibble on my part really, but...

When, at the end Tieran attempts to survive by escaping and hiding in a new host body...yet again...  
As it was explained in a few scenes before, wasn't the Doctor's device's operation and effectivenes was based on the implants Tieran used in his host bodies for the transference...which begs the question... was that man going to be a new willing host, which makes him out to be quite a distasteful traitor to be such a willing plaything just to get closer to having power...meanwhile Tieran himself can be played up as a tragic hero gone too far, spiralling out, losing himself...  
and alternatively, if not, if he did not have the implant would that not dispute the functionality of Doctor's device entirely..? Or am I missing something..? 


So, in the end, was it really only all done up to play off Jennifer Lien's, admittedly, brilliant (at least at that time) and brilliantly showcased varied range of acting abilities...with the story progression being mostly driven not by it's own logic and said world's created set of rules, intrinsic to it, but rather by days ex machina and plot armor...

Also, unrelated but on my mind at the moment...that Enterprise episode,  Rajiin... first and foremost as a matter of course, quite a few quibbles I have with it... and again with that seduction and sexuality trope of femme fatales/pseudo damsels-in-distress... meanwhile they're playing up the captain's personal recovery and setting up his character development as a man of integrity in a tough spot, an impossible situation really, while still trying to be true to himself, to what it means, what it is to be human...
And all that other story details setup for the things they'll be developing furthermore later on in the season, in retrospect that was quite good work in that aspect...  
and annoyingly, in the end, what happened to her, to Rajiin..? She seemed a lot more than what the insurgent agent on Risa, tracking info on Suliban turned out to be, both in acting and as a character front(ier)/angle... sad we never really got to learn more about her, and her whole story... or more about the stuff happening with all those new and quirky little civilisations found in the expanse, sadly no real follow-up, but I suppose there was a certain continuity point to go with that decision for the story...  
but still frustrating to see yet another character build up only to be discarded or lost almost immediately...yes, very much in vein of the original series, a monster &amp;/or story of the week/episode, a serial setup quite common, but for those moments and elements that were so beloved, there was meant to be a potential for their own continuity to be fitted in with the ongoing overarching story... 

also ...kind of in opposition or inversion of what happened to/with Kes.... or am I the only one seeing such deep dive patterns in character re-use, or the absence thereof such reoccurrences..."
0,"I just finished S3 E20 which wrapped up the rescue mission of Master Piell, Captain Tarkin and a group of clones where they had shared coordinates to the nexus hyper space lanes.

So far, I have seen Boba Fett trying to avenge the death of his father so this is definitely after the battle of geonosis, and seems to be getting close to Anakin turning to the dark side with his shared ideology with Captain Tarkin, where he could see the issues the Jedi code presents when it comes to getting in the way of assuring a republic victory in war, and saying he is close with the chancellor when trying to relate with Tarkin.

I would assume by now, we are in the middle of the movie for Episode 3 where there's lots of personal meetings with Anakin and the chancellor? Maybe the opera night is drawing near and he will soon learn that he could save people from death?

Is there a timeline to help guage where I am in the movies per episode?"

0,"Going to get back into reading with some star wars books. I don't care about canon and feel like I would love legends material. The phantom menace is the only book I ever read. Growing up the only expanded material I got of Star Wars was from the games; Jedi Academy, KOTOR 1, KOTOR 2, and I loved all the extra lore I got from them. I was think of first reading the trawn books, but I see there are two trilogy's? Heir to the empire trilogy and the treason, alliances trilogy. Which one should I go with? Is Luke features much in either one? Also what's the best old republic book, preferably one that features ancient sith.

I posted this first to r/starwarsbooks and got down voted, can't imagine why. Thank you in advance for you input."
1,"She was clearly hurt by the phaser's stun setting.  Riker could have hit her a couple more times with longer blasts, or he could have beamed down with a security team, and hit her with multiple phasers on stun setting.  He also could have put his com badge on Chorgon and just beamed him to the Enterprise, thereby eliminating the threat.  His decision to beam down by himself and immediately start blasting was totally idiotic.  He basically executed her without a trial, which is ironic because the Enterprise crew identified her from a picture of Penthor Mull being led to his trial.

Riker should have been court martialed.  He basically executed her because she lied to him about her identity and he was mad about it.

1,"I had a dawning of awareness watching the finale of DS9 yet again today. I've seen it before clearly. I've known it and seen the lead to it. But today it hit home.

Benjamin Sisko was meant to be with the prophets in the celestial temple. It's fated right? So much so that nothing can stand in it's way. 

So rooted in this nature is the way that one thing... One simple thing could have changed it. If Winn Adami, the motherf'n KAI of Bajor. Who has a coming to the prophets moment in the final moments of her miserable life, could just get over herself and her need to be validated for her ""heroic"" nature, she could have thrown the book into the fire, killed the Kosst Amojan and Sisko would be living at his hand crafted house with his kid and freighter captain... 

But no. She has to announce her intent, get burned alive by the pah-wraiths, give Dukat the chance to take control of it all and force Sisko to yet again prove that his balls and his belief are bigger than hers by tackling the last of Cardassia's old way of life into the incinerator before being pulled out by his mommy. 

As was Kai Winn's true legacy. She just couldn't keep her mouth shut... And it cost us arguably the greatest StarFleet  officer of all time. Or at least sent him along the same path as Discovery. It's not linear."
1,"and just thought I’d share my opinion here. 
Overall it was a decent show. I have avoided it totally since watching the first few episodes when it came out, mainly because of all the negative reviews it got. 
The first two series were the best I think. These followed the ‘exploring the galaxy’ theme that TNG had, with only a few double episodes and a vague hint at a bigger enemy contained throughout. 
Séries 3 was the worst I think, but only because there was 1 central story and each episode was part of getting to the Xindi and defeating them. It was a nice touch that there were different sub-sets of Xindi and they each had their own characteristics and values. The bigger enemy with the metal spheres was never really fully explained IMO though and I thought this should’ve been explored more. 
The final series was.....stupid. And I don’t just mean the last episode. There was way too many two or three part storylines and the other storylines didn’t make sense to the rest of it. 
The last episode was as bad as I had heard. I didn’t know much detail about it but knew it was bad and that it had something to do with TNG. To have it set just before the decommissioning of the Enterprise, 6years after series 3 was ridiculous. What happened in those 6 years? What happened to T’Pal and Tucker? Why did they break up? What did they do for 6 years and why was no one promoted after 10 years on the job? I understand they had to end the show but to set it 6 years after series 4 was a bad judgement call. And for Trip to die?? What the actual?? What was the point in that? It was a senseless death, totally unnecessary. Was it the only thing he could think of to beat the aliens? Oh but then 4 days later abs everyone at the ceremony was happy and having a great time despite a colleague of 10 years being killed? Yeah sure. 
Even the Data ‘cameo’ was poor. I mean it didn’t even make sense. Data saying he didn’t understand ‘raincheck’ 🙄. 

I’m sure you’ve all heard this before but just wanted to add my voice. And please don’t bash me for this, I’m not here to debate, just wanted to voice my opinion."

1,"Believing himself to be in the afterlife after rudely getting bridged to death, Kirk finds himself on trial for the lives he's lost and the ones he's taken.  A 1950s TV style courtroom drama, with fashion that nods to Shatner's twilight zone days.  All the cameos in the world can be explored, from the movies to TOS villains, and even nods to the novels. 

As what seems to be an imminent conviction grows nearer Kirk begins to piece the true nature of his existence--he is an imprint of Kirk's consciousness, trapped in the nexus, which is about to tear apart a thriving three-planet colony (so we can intercut some starship action with a small cast of new characters), and where locals have reported sightings of the late Starfleet hero dismissed as ghost stories or a disrespectful conspiracy theory of some kind.  Kirk makes the ultimate sacrifice one more time, saving the planets by causing the nexus the breach and dissipate-- destroying the imprint in the process.  Which Kirk experiences as a window into all of the timelines and gets to deliver a tearful farewell to Spock, who appears to hear him, using leftover footage from Kelvin films.  

Epilogue has Shatner appearing to Pine in a dream/vision in the shipyard bar back in Iowa, suggesting he may have survived outside of the Nexus. It also might just mean Pine is now aware of his life in the other timeline because of the intersecting that happened when the nexus was breached, and lol you can't kill Kirk.

If the Founders had such great technology why wouldn't they find a way to make a mini lab or use similar technology to Star Fleets replicators but for Ketracel White? This way if they get marooned on a planet, the Jem'Hadar can last longer and serve the founders longer."

I have heard Season 3 is where it gets good, but it seems like I am so far away from that point. I’m optimistic that Season 2 will be better than season one."
0,"The Disney era lacks the personhood and subtle characterization of non-humans that even the prequels were able to reach.

Chewbacca’s death in the NJO was a shattering moment, the emotional repercussions of which spanned several books. Han Solo dies in TFA and Chewbacca is never given time to mourn. His feelings are packed into a single half-ass rampage on Starkiller Base and then he seems to immediately forget his lifelong best friend for the duration of the trilogy.

The last two movies should have been Chewie going on a non-stop mission of vengeance, tearing down the First Order brick by brick until he came face to face with Kylo, his own nephew, and had to decide what to do. 

That’s all. That’s my take."

The Expanse, on a similar note, is a hard-sci fi show that illustrates the emptiness and implacable darknesss within space. No xenomorphs, no black holes, or giant space worms, just the infinite darkness. Space itself is a very terrifying thing, and contents like The Expanse and Knights of The Old Republic 2 really show the extents.

Neelix is actually a good component of this episode, mentoring Tuvok a bit, which leads to Tuvok bending the rules. That causes the four crewmen to change their attitude towards him, again, somewhat believable.

1,"Another redditor [just posted about](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/m027ng/in_sons_of_mogh_ds9_worf_and_bashir_wipe_worfs/) how cringe-inducing the ending to DS9's ""Sons of Mogh"" is. And, frankly, I have to agree. However, when reading through that post and comments, I developed an idea about the episode that makes me feel very differently about it. I've come to the conclusion that, if not for a few missed storytelling opportunities. ""Sons of Mogh"" *should have been a great episode*. Prepare yourself for a TL;DR -- I'm in quarantine and have nothing better to do. :)

&amp;#x200B;

To start, ST:DS9 4x15 ""Sons of Mogh"" is a callback to ST:TNG 5x15 ""Ethics."" Both show how Worf's worldviews and attitudes have been changed by his time in the Federation. In ""Ethics,"" Riker refuses to help Worf commit ritual suicide -- just as Worf refuses to help Kurn in ""Sons of Mogh"" -- and eventually another option presents itself. Worf undergoes an untested and risky procedure that will either restore motor function or result in his death. In the long-run, Worf is grateful that his shipmates aboard the Enterprise convinced him not to undergo Hegh'bat, and he goes on to live many more glory-filled years.

&amp;#x200B;

The missed opportunity in ""Song of Mogh"" is that there's no actual callback. No one ever mentions the events of ""Ethics."" Worf never sits Kurn down and tells him about the time he was paralyzed. Sure, they talk about how Worf lived in dishonor, for the sake of the Empire, for years, but no one mentions the time that he faced a life-changing back injury and asked a friend (a friend that Worf considered to be a brother!) to help him with a ritual suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

There are clear similarities. Like Worf's shipmates in ""Ethics,"" Worf enlists the help of his colleagues to find another option for Kurn. Like Worf, Kurn struggles with the ideas they come up with. Just as Worf could not envision a life worth living without the use of his legs, Kurn cannot envision a life worth living without his honor. Eventually, in both episodes, a radical and risky idea is presented, one that will give each a chance to find a life worth living. Here again, however, ""Sons of Mogh"" misses an opportunity: there's no scene where Worf and Kurn discuss the mindwipe, no scene where they talk about the tradeoffs. We can *assume* that Kurn consented to this, but we never see it. Which is shame in  part because Tony Todd plays Kurn and would have nailed that scene, and in part because this non-existent scene could have placed this episode at the heart of a major theme in TNG *and* DS9: the Klingon Empire's struggle with its own identity.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout TNG and DS9, we see the Klingon Empire at an inflection point. Positions of power are held by corrupt politicians, the Empire's centuries-long expansion has halted, the alliance with the Federation has brought about an unprecedented (and for many, deeply unwelcome) era of peace. Holding to the old ways will eventually lead to the Empire's demise, but surviving in this new age would mean abandoning some traditions. The Empire can either double down and perish, or it can change its ways and survive. What is at stake for the Empire, either way, is its *identity*. To hold fast, unchanging, and die, or to change, at least in part, and survive.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, ""Sons of Mogh"" fails to make the connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking the episode as part of the broader storytelling arc of TNG and DS9, rather than a one-off episode, it is *powerful*. Many in the Empire view Worf's way of life as a perversion and a corruption of traditional Klingon society; they would rather die than change their ways. In ""Ethics,"" we see Worf struggle as his values clash with Federation values, and Picard helpfully explains that, for Worf, ""the road between"" ritual suicide or living without use of his legs ""covers a lifetime of values, beliefs."" Here, Kurn is facing that same dilemma: Kurn ""can't make the journey"" that Worf is asking of him. Even two sentences about this experience from Worf would have been a brilliant callback.

&amp;#x200B;

Kurn's identity is partly personal; he has a life, a family, personal honor. But the bedrock of his identity is his identity as member of a group. Klingons value their identity *as Klingons* in a way that Federation civilizations often have trouble fully grasping. The choice that Kurn faces (or, that he should have faced -- again, we have to assume that he was presented with the choice and consented to the mind-wipe), is to trade a *part* of his identity in order to continue living *as a Klingon*.

&amp;#x200B;

The Empire faces the same conundrum: to sacrifice a *part* of its identity in order to survive. This arc was prominent throughout TNG and one of the central themes of DS9. ""Sons of Mogh"" *should* stand as a poignant episode in that arc. Instead, we are left  wondering whether or not Kurn even agreed to the procedure. And that lack of consent, that lack of consideration, that lack of Kurn *making a choice*, guts  the poignancy that this episode should have had.

&amp;#x200B;

Had the writers made the point just a little more clear, that Kurn is trading a *part of his identity* (not his whole identity; the way of life of a Klingon, his membership in that society, that bedrock part of Kurn's identity, would actually be *preserved* through this procedure) for a chance at a life worth living, and made it clear that Kurn considers the risks and decides that he was willing, I believe this the episode would have resonated as one of the best of the series, perhaps even the franchise. Worf offers Kurn a drastic and risky alternative to an honorable death: he offers him a way to live. And, as Picard said in ""Ethics,"" ""a Klingon may not be good at accepting defeat, but he knows all about taking risks.""

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of *two entire series*, Worf convinces the Empire to make choice that Kurn *should* have been allowed to make for himself: to sacrifice a part of its identity for the chance at a new life. This choice *defines* Klingons in the TNG/DS9/VOY era. What a shame that ""Sons of Mogh"" doesn't make that connection."
0,"Just some quick thoughts I had. All of these aren’t related.

1. Omega is an early attempt at a force sensitive clone. Obviously they are important in some way because they are in the show and have that little jewel thing on their head. It woud also go with the theme of all of the Bad Batch members having some kind of special/modified quality or talent to them.
2. At this time, the Empire is considering keeping their military full of clones and not replacing them with people. This is why there is still a young clone, Omega, in the facility. At one point, the Bad Batch are convinced to free many other clones from their control chip in a large scale event, leading to a small uprising against the Empire from this group of ”freed” clones. They are all eventually defeated, but convince the Empire to stop creating more clones and to start recruiting.
3. Again, regarding Omega, even if the rest of the Bad Batch die in the end, which is somewhat likely, Omega will survive and come up in future Star Wars material. No matter what her role ends up being, I think that Star Wars is currently trying to connect everything up more (which I love), and they could appear in future games or tv shows as a bigger character.

If you noticed anything in the trailer that completely contradicts these, please let me know. I am just now realizing that the second one is less of a theory and more of something that I very much want to happen because it would be cool, but whatever."

0,"My opinion is probably in the minority, but I think that Anakin was horribly overrated as a Force user.

There really isn't a lot of canon evidence that Anakin was actually any good at using the Force, unless you count the Clone Wars cartoons, but seriously, it's the movies that count. And if you mention the EU I will just shake my head and feel sorry for you, because no one wants to have a reasoned debate over the musings of a 3rd rate fantasy novelist cranking out Star Wars books at 4 am before the deadline just to pay their bills.

The main issue with Anakin's exploits is that he has almost no major victories against experienced Jedi/Sith under his belt, except against Dooku. Everything he's done which is supposed to be impressive happened off screen or against massively inferior competition. He's the Kimbo Slice or Greg Oden of Star Wars. A lot of hype but no delivery. So the question in these situations is always if maybe it was just unfortunate circumstance, like that guy you play pick up hoops that misses his first 10 shots and then blames it on his sore elbow. Every week. Or if he just wasn't that good to begin with.

On the minus side he:

Lost his right hand to Dooku and got knocked out, after trying to double-saber.
Got captured on Geonosis, and nearly executed until saved by Windu.
Lost both of his legs in a duel against Obi-Wan, although in Anakin's defense he was at the massive disadvantage of being slightly lower. In a sword fight where they could both see each other clearly. Anakin ended the fight burning next to a pool of lava.
Got his spaceship shot up by Han Solo. Nice Force reflexes.
Lost his right hand again, this time to Luke, a freshly minted Jedi Knight.
But it's not all bad. Let's look at Anakin's achievements.

Won a local podrace at age 9.
Got the high score on the midichlorian test.
Destroyed a droid control ship, after being shot down and crashing inside the ship, and discovering the proton torpedo button.
Slaughtered a village full of Sandpeople.
Managed to not get eaten for 5 minutes in the Geonosian execution ring, facing off against some dangerous looking animals.
Defeated Count Dooku one-on-one.
Did whatever was mentioned in all that background filler conversation with Obi-Wan.
Bushwhacked Mace Windu.
Killed a lot of six year-olds at the Jedi Academy.
Killed a room full of unarmed Trade Federation bureaucrats.
Terrorized a princess.
Killed Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan threw the fight.
De-handed Luke, a Force neophyte with a whole six weeks of training. But it took him like 10 minutes and he still took a shot to the arm.
Defeated Palpatine, by using such advanced Force techniques as grabbing him and throwing him down a conveniently placed giant hole. Again, Anakin wins by blindsiding and betraying his otherwise occupied opponent, and his primary strength here is the ability to take a bolt of Force lightning to the face and keep walking.
So, to me this list doesn't scream ""most powerful Jedi ever"". Nothing other than the midichlorian count points in that direction. What I see is an opportunistic backstabber with a penchant for bullying non-Force users and getting de-limbed.

Yeah, yeah, Clone Wars, I know. But we all know that cartoons and video games don't count as anything but filler."

0,"Sabine just took the dark saber from Maul without actually defeating him. Technically, Kenobi defeated maul and killed him. Vader then defeated Kenobi. Then in ROTJ, Luke somewhat defeated Vader in combat (without killing him) which would make him the ruler. Then Luke died in LJ from using the force too much. So despite not actually having the dark saber, wouldn’t that make the force the rightful ruler of mandalor?"
1,"TL;DR at bottom  


This thought started out of two of my bigger gripes from all trekdom:  


\*For a ship on a mission of exploration, Enterprise D does very little exploring  
\* Q's character arc goes from menacing trickster God who might just wipe you out of existence on a whim, to comic relief who gets treated like a minor nuisance.  


To the first point, every Episode of TNG starts with the only slightly modified narration from TOS. We're told a clear mission statement to explore strange new worlds and go where no one has gone before. Yet, in the vast majority of TNG episodes, they are going where plenty of people have already been. They are visiting human colonies, negotiating treaties with known species, looking in on planets applying for Federation membership, dealing with Romulans in the Neutral Zone, zipping back to Earth for one reason or another, etc. etc. This is an incredibly inefficient way to explore deep space. It would be like trying to drive from east coast to west coast of the US, but you keep turning around in the middle of the country to run errands in New Jersey.   


I'm currently on a rewatch of TNG and this has been bugging me. The entire conflict in Encounter at Farpoint is that Q is trying to prevent humanity from venturing beyond Farpoint station into the ""great unexplored mass of the galaxy."" They defeat the challenge posed by Q and push on into unexplored space. And then in the second episode they are in position to respond to a distress call from a Federation ship. By the second season, pretty much all pretense of the Enterprise as a deep space exploration vessel is gone. They are routinely rotating out crew, and are running errands around the alpha quadrant for Starfleet.   


A couple of things have caught my attention. First, in the episode ""Conspiracy"" Data detects an unusual pattern of crew redeployments as the first hard evidence of the alien takeover of Starfleet. We also know that there was opposition to the Conspicary from within Starfleet Command (though ultimately they fell to the aliens.) It could be explained that the Enterprise's original change in mission was caused early in the first season by the factions maneuvering inside Starfleet command, both trying to infiltrate Enterprise, and trying to keep Enterprise close to home to help fight the threat.   


After Conspiracy, Starfleet Command must have been deeply shaken, and it would be understandable that there would be a period of self evaluation before resuming normal operations. But that never happens. As things are getting back to normal, here comes Q. The very next time we see Q is the time he introduces humanity to the Borg. This has ripple effects.   


It is not long after Q-Who that we have the war games in the episode ""Peak Performance."" From the beginning there is resistance as ""Starfleet is not a military organization"" and Picard cites a ""shift in focus"" to deal with the Borg threat. From then on, the die is cast. Starfleet is preparing for an invasion. That means keeping your assets close to home.   


Looking beyond TNG, where else does Q pop up - On DS9, very soon after the Federation discovers the shortcut to the Gamma quadrant. Ultimately he doesn't have to worry about humans spilling out of their section of the Galaxy as the Dominion shuts down that path.   


Then he starts popping up on Voyager - the Federation ship on the wrong side of the Galaxy. Yes, there's always pretense for him popping in, but the pattern is that he's always checking in where humans are extending themselves out further across the galaxy.   


Although Q's offers to send Voyager all the way home are rejected based on the price asked, he does provide them with a route that ""takes a few years off."" Who knows what discoveries Voyager missed out on following Q's route? Ultimately Voyager drops off the only members of delta quadrant species and gets home after multiple ""skips"" forward through space Courtesy of Kes, the Borg, and others. Yes, they return with knowledge of different patches of the Delta quadrant, but no means of bringing humans out that far to colonize. Besides, what news they bring from the Delta Quadrant hardly makes it look inviting to explore: Kazon, Vidians, Hirogen, Borg, etc.   


But, the exploration setbacks don't end there, do they? We have a window all the way forward to the 32nd century now, and, as far as we can tell, there was no massive leap forward, no Apotheosis of man into a god-like creature as Picard imagined was Q's real worry. What else might Q have had a hand in that we don't yet know about? The Romulan star going supernova? The Burn? The events that led to the Spore drive becoming lost technology (in the 23rd century?)  


Maybe he wasn't involved in those, but knew what was coming and what needed to be done to hold back humanity just enough that when events played out, they would have the desired effect of keeping Humanity contained. Maybe the slapstick Q we get in Voyager is belying his real mission of checking in to make sure everything is happening according to plan.   


TL;DR - Q dropped the Borg on humanity right after the events of Conspiracy, so Enterprise-D's mission never went back to full on exploration. He then monitored humans wherever they were likely to make large advances outside the Alpha quadrant. Humanity was still on its heels when the Dominion War came, followed by the synth attack. The Federation shifted from an exploration focus to protectionism. Q accomplished exactly what he set out to do in Encounter at Farpoint."
1,"Anyone else listen to this podcast? I love everything about it. The format, the humor and jokes between the host, the trivia section at the end, and the concept; that is going through every episode and movie by star date. But sadly they gave up halfway through season 3 of Enterprise. My real question is are there any other Trek podcast similar to TAFM?"
1,It just seemed to disappear!
0,"Hey everyone! A recent rewatching of the prequels inspired this post. As a fan of prequels I've always had to grapple with the messy parts of trilogy. It's up for debate if TPM or AotC is the weakest link but imo it is the latter. The main purpose of Episode I is to establish a new chapter in the SW universe. Episode II has the burden of introducing adult Anakin &amp; planting the seeds of Vader. 

Lucas has said in interviews that his intent for AotC was basically to be a space rendition of Dr. Zhivago. With that in mind, I can understand his narrative choices even if they're not necessarily what I want as a viewer. What I propose is a rewrite of the first act of AotC.

In my version of AotC, the film begins with Anakin &amp; Obi-Wan returning to Coruscant for Anakin to undergo the Jedi trials. They arrive on the planet &amp; are unexpectedly greeted by Chancellor Palpatine. He admires how much Anakin has grown &amp; asks how long he will stay. Anakin replies that his missions will soon take him back to the Outer Rim. Palpatine ends the brief exchange with a cryptic hint implying that Anakin may stay on Coruscant longer than expected.

Obi-Wan leads Anakin away &amp; the two of them report to the Jedi temple. Anakin undergoes the trials and demonstrates his power with the Force and the seven lightsaber forms. The Council is highly impressed with Anakin's development after only 10 years of training and award him the rank of Jedi Knight. Anakin is showered with praise for a second time, feeding his arrogance &amp; ego.

Following the trials Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin stand together at an overlook &amp; watch a precession of Senator's ship arrive for a vote on recent Separatist aggression. Among them is Padme from Naboo. As Anakin watches her fondly from a distance Obi-Wan begins to express pride in the Jedi Anakin is becoming. At that moment Padme's ship explodes. Chaos ensues &amp; Anakin erupts in anger &amp; pain. Obi-Wan struggles to console him.

Following the aftermath Padme is revealed to be alive &amp; safe. The Senate vote proceeds as scheduled &amp; sanctions are imposed on the Separatist systems. Palpatine requests for Padme to remain on Coruscant but she refuses. As a compromise Padme is assigned a Jedi escort, specifically Anakin. The Council finds the Chancellor's request odd, but approve based on Anakin's recent performance during his trials.

From there the story resumes the remaining plotline of AotC. Obi-Wan investigates the assassination attempt on Padme &amp; discovers the clone army on Kamino. He tracks Jango Fett to Geonosis &amp; meets Count Dooku. The relationship between Anakin &amp; Padme unfolds &amp; they travel to Tatooine in search of Anakin's mother. Anakin slaughters the tribe of Tuskan Raiders &amp; takes his first step toward the Dark Side. Obi-Wan's distress call compels Padme to go to Geonosis &amp; the final act plays out identical to the movie.

TLDR; Change the first act of AotC to focus on Anakin as a rising Jedi. This sets him up for a greater fall at hands of Count Dooku at the end of film &amp; gives his character better justification to betray the Jedi in RotS (not taking TCW into account)."
1,"Nothing against Will, but Data looks damn good in red!

0,The themes are so similar. Just wondering if anyone has compared the works in depth.
1,"I commented recently on a post about Discovery saying something along the lines of ""I miss old trek and I wish this were better"" and was attacked by a slew of comments telling me I wasn't ""woke"" enough to understand new trek. My ""Wokeness"" has no impact on bad writing, the mary-sue-ness of Michael Burnham, and plot holes. It's just very upsetting to me with how many streaming services and money there is in show business today that it seems impossible to find a production company and writing staff as DS9 had. Like when is CBS going to realize that 99% of Trek fans prefer how they used to be, not how they have been in the past 5 years. I know TNG wasn't super popular when it came out, but the new shows are totally different, where it kept the same premise of TOS. They aren't serialized, they pay way more attention to the action than thought-provoking stories, and they are filled with plot holes that the old shows avoided by being serialized. I just wanna know people's honest thoughts on whether it is even possible to make a new version like the old ones were, or if CBS will ever recognize that. I'm not looking through rosy-eyed glasses as I have watched all of the series besides the 3 most recent (DISCO, PIC, and LD) as a child and an adult, the old-style treks just hold up, supported by good stories, writing, and characters."
1,"Data admits to obstructing Picard's investigation into the missing time period. Picard replies by asking Data if he is ready to be court-martialed, and Data says, You gotta do what you gotta do, Captain.

Picard then says that Starfleet would seize Data and strip him down to the wires to find out what went wrong with him.

So ... Data is not an autonomous being, with the full rights and privileges of any other sentient being of the Federation? I understand the line was included to make the scene come across as very dire, but surely every civil rights organization of the 24th century would be apoplectic about Data's human / ""sentient being's"" rights being violated.

Data is obviously protected by the laws which protect other sentient beings--and this is an open and shut case. Sure, court-martial Data, and even imprison him after a fair and open trial--if he really did break the law, but it would go against everything the Federation and Starfleet stand for if he was subjected to ""extraordinary rendition"", and taken to some blacksite where he was in fact ""stripped down to the wires to find out what went wrong"".

All that said, this line of dialogue makes it easy to see that when Authorities, who have the capability, want to break the law, they just go ahead and do it. History is replete with examples of Authorities breaking the law, and getting away with it because, ""We had to know,"" or, ""We didn't know then what we know now""."
1,"All at the same pace, too, it looks like, which is uncanny, but nice too! As a big fan of this show especially, I'm really appreciating the multiple posts I saw here on VOY these past couple weeks. I'm watching it too because incidentally following Garrett Wang and R.D. McNeill's podcast. Starting season 4 now, a bit ahead of them...

Are some of you who were detractors of that series starting to reconsider your opinion of it? 

I personally found it really cool from the first time I watched it. The ""survival in unknown territory"" aspect and the adventure of it have always been fascinating to me, how the crew is coping with isolation and living together on that ship is very relevant to 2021, and Janeway as a captain is always a joy to watch!"

1,"I understand that Naomi is growing up and all, like we all do, but the way she treated Neelix during his last days on Voyager was kinda cold and mean, and yes, I understand it's the writers' way to move Neelix's story along so he can leave Voyager and stay with his new family on the Talaxian colony, but the execution was poorly done as it made Naomi seem like a bitch to Neelix, I mean, no goodbye hug or kiss to the man who took care of you?"

I watched this episode for the first time as a junior in college.  I remember being so taken with this episode as a lover 1980s video games.  BUT, watching Picard this time in his Ready Room explaining to his colleagues about how fricken cool it was to experience virtual reality struck a chord with me this time.  

I mean how many times have I explained to my older relatives my experiences with my Oculus Quest sounding just like Jean Luc.  Wow!

0,"So Avatar (ATLA and Korra to be specific, not the movies about those blue aliens) has always been my star wars. And they just announced that avatar studios is created for the sole reason to make new shows and movies + shorts in the avatar universe. 

First an animated theatrical movie is on the way.

I want quality over quantity so the news also bring fear as well, I don't want a star wars universe where mostly everything is fan service instead of going for new worldbuilding, eras, storytelling and characters.

I hope the movies will be on atla and Lok, maybe kyoshi, while the other shows will be on complete new stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

nearly all of them have to do with pre existing stuff and the same era.

Ashoka sequel, rogue one prequel (cassian endor), clone wars sequel (bad batch, boba fett, obi wan, Lando or everything to do with the time frame from the skywalker era.

I wish star wars would do more stuff like avatar wan or korra with just brand new stuff and complete new characters after or before the skywalker 9 movies timeline.

The most interesting original idea is the acolyte for now since it seems to happen with complete new characters and an era outside of the movies.

I want only the movies to resolve around ATLA/LOK and the shows to go for new frontiers like they did with Lok and wan.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I was more looking forward to the rian johnson trilogy and the acolyte as it would have dealt with complete new stuff.

I hope Avatar won't do what Star wars disney+ is doing now and just base everything on pre-existing characters from the same era as ATLA/LOK.

Am I wrong to think this way?"

1,"As far as I know, Guinan is the only character that has been publicly invited back to the star trek universe for the upcoming season, during Patrick Stewart's appearance on the view where he asked in front of the audience if she would come back.

So who else might they bring back that would tie into precious canon and mix with Guinans character?

The one that I am hoping for is Q, the one I think seems obvious and easier to pull off with success is Worf.

Michael Dorn has been in more star trek episodes and movies than any one else, even Leanord Nimoy I believe. The Klingons have been pretty much dormant in discovery since the first season, and I think nonexistent so far in Picard unless they are somewhere in the background that I didnt notice.
Romulans and Klingons were mortal enemies forever, but towards the end of DS9 Worf started changing his mind about the romulans, remarking in the end of the war of the dominion about the romulans having honor despite his entire character arc up until then saying the opposite.

Michael Dorn is awesome and I wouldn't mind that being season 2 canon, and Guinan and Worf obviously had a subtle connection on TNG where multiple scenes involved them spending time together in ten forward. In a way, Guinan is a big part of the reason why Worf did the right thing and chose to try and become a good father. Plus, prune juice.

What I really want to see is Q.

Yes there are moments between 'micro brain with a macro head' and Q, but Micharl Dorn stated he would only come back for an important role, so bringing back all 3 seems improbable unless Worf is the major part that would seemingly be a seed for a Worf spin off afterwards.


We don't know a lot about 'Q the misanthrope', but what we do know is that there is a strong connection with Q and Picard, and Q and synthetics. Most people are aware of the connection between Q and Picards character, Q was there when his heart exploded and pretended to be his God, etc.

The more interesting parts to me are between Q and data, and  by extension synthetics. As well as between Q and Guinan.

Q and Guinan. Both have preexisting knowledge of each other before their time on enterprise, and both claim the other is dangerous. Guinan at one point even pretends to be doing some sort of defensive stance when she sees Q in ten forward, like she knows some way to defend against Qs powers. The whole episodes adds so many questions (Borg introduction episode) without a lot of answers that this part is easy to miss but the writers never got around to addressing that plot hole. Guinan is also the only thing to do physical damage to Q and not face repercussions for it. She stabbed Q with a fork while he had no powers, but getting vengeance on her after getting his abilities back didnt even seem to be a part of his thinking, granted the Calamar did more damage to him.

Q and Data. While Q was mortal and aboard the starship, the only person who advocated for Q was Data. When Q was caught in the tachyon (I think that's what it was) beam from the Calamar ship, and being pulled towards the calamar ship, it was data who saved Qs life while risking his own. Q even gave data a genuine gift on parting, allowing him to experience laughter without changing Data beyond a level which he would have been comfortable with.

So in a way Q now has an interest in synthetics as well. Picard is now a synthetic, and so is Soji, feels like a good time to update humanities trial by the Q."

0,"Just finished reading Death Troopers and I was pleasantly surprised.  It is basically Dead Space set in the Star Wars universe and, in my opinion, it worked.  I wasn’t expecting much and it hit most of the tropes but I was pleasantly surprised throughout, even the famous cameo was okay but not necessary.  

Disney isn’t know for R rated or horror movies so it’s probably never going to happen but is there ever going to be anything like death troopers on the big screen?"
1,"I read the book ***Trekonomics*** back in September and I have somewhat mixed feelings about it, but it did get me to thinking of what it would take to move society towards that path. The author **Manu Saadia** makes some good points and the part of the book that has stuck with me is the amount of work that would need to be accomplished to do so. **I am paraphrasing a lot of his thoughts because I have forgotten so much of what I read.** He talks about space exploration and how engineers and scientists believe that it is a good way to foster peace and cooperation throughout the world. Saadia posits that while that is all well and good, we would probably better off if resources were better-spent lifting 1 billion people out of poverty. That who's to say how many Einsteins or von Neumann's we would find in that group of people. The globe would need 4 million more engineers, medical scientists, and programmers, raw human capital to achieve the goals that the Star Trek universes. 

One example he used about free stuff that really helps people is what Reagan gave away for free during his administration, and that was the technology of GPS. When a South Korean airliner crossed into Russian air space they had no clue they had done so and after numerous attempts to make them understand what they had done, the Russian military shot the plane down killing all 269 people aboard. The Navy already used it and in 1983 Reagan signed an executive order making the Pentagon's GPS system available to the public. 

In that vein, what other technologies or products could be made available to the public that would further a goal of a better society across the planet? Would 3D printers, which are kind of like pre-replicators or satellite broadband that Musk is putting in the skies above us bring the future of Trek ever closer?"

4. Kylo and Rey vs the Praetorian guards: an inexperienced girl and a somewhat experienced guy won against a bunch of trained guards. How could that be? They are a dyad and powerful in the force together and this shows us that without even telling us but instead shows us through the rough choreography. 8/10

5. Kylo vs Luke: hands down the best duel in this franchise, the anger and hate leaking from Kylo is a masterpiece of acting, and the cinematography is the best cinema could offer, as well as Luke realizing his mistake and becoming the legend everyone sees him as. 10/10

6. Kylo vs Rey on Kijimi: shows us how powerful these two are in the force without swinging lightsabers, yeah there are a few but the focus is on their immense opposite power against each other being showed with space manipulation. 8/10

1,"Farouk El-Baz is an Egyptian-American space scientist/geologist who intensively trained the commanders and lunar module pilots of Apollos 15, 16, and 17, so that these test pilots turned scientists could use their skills of description to deliver specific and accurate lunar geology descriptions, since it probably cost around a million dollars per minute to have them on the surface of the moon during their EVAs.

Some of it is related in the mini-series ""From the Earth to the Moon"", the one that opens with Tom Hanks. (Fantastic, go watch it. It relates the Apollo-era compressed into 13 episodes I believe, in the frame of reference of the 1960's, by the people who lived it)

The rest is related by Memory Alpha.

&gt; El-Baz was the first Type 15 shuttlepod seen on Star Trek: The Next Generation.

&gt; The Star Trek Encyclopedia (4th ed., vol. 1, p. 231) stated the shuttlepod ""was named for former NASA planetary geoscientist Farouk El-Baz, currently on the faculty at Brown University.""

&gt; Rick Sternbach recalled on the naming, ""And in a supreme example of coincidence, I had suggested that one of the the little boxy shuttlepods in TNG be named El-Baz, after Farouk El-Baz, one of the Apollo lunar geology experts (one of my faves along with Hal Masursky). We had no idea that Rick Berman actually did some filming with El-Baz ages before Trek. The name was approved. The other part of the story goes that his kids were watching TNG the night the pod was featured and yelled out that the shuttle had the same name. Neat."""

This would lead to his early retirement with Beverly who would be activily trying to develop the cure for her husband, while Captain Will Riker of the USS Titan and Captain Data of the USS Enterprise F are activily searching for the cure neglecting their jobs to help their friend. They find the only way to cure the captain is via the borg queen and picard having to return to the collective to restore his memories which still exist in the collective, and find the cure held within the collective. Still thinking on the rest, but I think this would make a great season finale where we just here the Queen saying ""welcome home Lequitis"" as he enters the collective. 

What are your thoughts and what would you have done?"

1,"\-Whales! All it takes is an old Klingon Bird of Prey, warping around Sol, to travel back in time. Thus, equally possible to travel forward in time, to deliver said whales.

\-Discovery enters 900+ years in the future. Their tech is destroyed to prevent others from using it.

\-Temporal wars. No description, yet temporal police/gatekeepers were shown in the previous series. Are they Q? How to they both exist outside of time yet have a stake in real-time events?

\-Georgio left because her body wanted to be back in her time, allowed by the gate keepers. (noting to do with a spin-off series).

Time is the 4th dimension in our universe. If gate keepers exist in our future, they would never have allowed Kirk and company to save humpback whales.

I guess ""time-crystals"" was a cop-out for writers block. 

Star Trek captivates the imagination about what is possible in the future. 

Time crystals deserve to remain in the world of Orcs, Elves, and Wizards. Not Stark Trek."

Every night I watch an episode of TOS, then TNG, then DS9 comes on. Tonight is the one where Keiko is told to teach the Bajoran religious perspective on the wormhole as part of her science class. Somehow, almost every episode, I can’t make it more than 10 minutes in without a character bothering me so much I just can’t watch anymore. Sometimes it’s immaturity, misplaced stubbornness, or pure stupidity, or just generally being unlikeable (I realize it’s not the job of the show to make “likeable” characters). I know people LOVE this show. What’s the appeal folks? Why do y’all love DS9 so much?"

0,"Hello there! So I'm already a far way off from possibly reading these books but I still wanted to ask the question. Are the legends books that take place after the Battle of Endor worth the read? I've read most of the Old Republic books and have Darth Plagueis and the Bane trilogy in my sights first but after that I was thinking of starting the post Endor book series. Now I already know I liked at least 1. My dad had this old copy of the Courtship of Princess Leia book which I LOVED but never got much into because I read it wasn't 1st in the timeline. Will all the books be as interesting? What's the order exactly? Are there any I can skip and it'll be alright?

Long question I know, its just I want to make sure I do it right and don't waste money and time with bad books."
1,Sad or gloriously tragic like the fall of Troy. We know nothing about the ship besides a few basics. A series that could start from shake down to the afternath of the ending. I wouldnt rehash the tng episode but show the battle from the klingon view mainly and the c after they get back.

1,"Hi Guys! I just finished  watching Discovery and still have some questions what you maybe can answer.  
Sorry for my bad English. A few questions from Season 2 and 3.  


Season 2 Questions:  


1. It was said that Spock killed the guards in the establishment he was kept in. This was not true, who faked the \*tape/record\* of him killing thoose guards? The Control or the Section 31?  

2. Where is the original lorca? The one not from the Terran Univers?  

3. The vision what captain Pike seein of his future when he touched the time crystal, is it his real fate in the other series? Or was the Klingon wrong when he said: If you take the crystal you seal your fate?  

4. Who brought the poeple to the Terralysium? I mean Michael did not do such things while being the second red angel. About her Mother, she wanted to save Michael and stop Control from getting the sphere date. But why saving random people and putting them to a random planet?  

5. They all know that there are 7 red signs out there before they even knew anything about time travelling. But when Michael said goodbye to Spock she told him to look for the 7th sign. (as if it did not happen yet) So did they all happen before or not?

Season 3 Questions:  


1. What was Booker hiding in his ship?  Dilithium?  

2. What was really wrong with Detmer? She seemed more stressed out than the others on the ship.  

3. Why did everyone know that Melody which one Gray was playing? Where did it come from?  

4. Did the Sphere date die at the end?  

5. When Philippa Georgiou (The Terran one) was sick of time, she had a vision where someone seemed dieing and she called for him/her as San or Hassan I am not sure anymore. Who is he/she?  

6. Could Gray be reconstructed like they did with Hugh before?"

1,"I have read a lot of posts from fans who think that Louise Fletcher as Kai Winn was an amazing casting choice and she killed it playing the role. Now, I love DS9, and I think Kai Winn was a good character, but I thought Louise Fletcher was terrible! She struggles with a lot of the sci-if dialogue, and in many scenes she just looked like she had no idea what was going on (example - watch the scene where the prophets/pah-wraith first speak to her).

Am I alone in thinking this?"
1,"I love star trek, but the 90's era in particular had a major issue with introducing insane plot elements for characters than never get adressed in a meaningful way. Some examples off the top of my head include:

- Voyager: Tuvok and Neelix never once talking to each other about the time they spent as Tuvix
- DS9: O'brien dying and being replaced with an O'brien from a different timeline
- Voyager: Kim dying and being replaced with a Kim from a parallel dimension
- TNG: Will Riker having a time-displaced clone of himself running around (yes, I know he came back in DS9 but on TNG, nothin)
- Voyager: Paris kidnapping Janeway to turn her into a lizard monster, populating a planet with their mutant offspring, and having a single 1 minute conversation about it.

Voyager does it a lot is what I'm saying, I guess. Please, grace me with any other lingering plot points you can think of."

1,"There's no wonder in new Star Trek. There's just human drama and lecturing on 2020 social issues. 

Man, does that episode give any sci-fi fan a thrill though. The idea of being flung such a distance. I wish they had focused more on that angle, than the mystical stuff, and the boy-wonder stuff. I had no problem with Wesley moving the plot and discovering the Traveler is doing all the heavy lifting, and the Traveler taking a shine to the clever young man - but when they start labelling him a potential galactic level mind-warp prodigy, that goes a little far. That should have never left the writer's table. Where do you go with that?

One of the few bright spots of season 1 for me though. Probably my favorite."
0,"Rewatching Clone Wars, but I watch [chronologically](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder)

Aside from introduction of Bariss, both the Zillo Beast arc and the Droid Factory arc are pretty stand alone and you’d have no way to place them in the overall chronology.

This being the case, why is the chronology such that we have to watch Zillo Beast (from the end of season 2) before Droid Factory (end of Season 2)?

I think it’s because we’re supposed to remember the impenetrable skin of the Zillo beast which we know Palpatine wanted to weaponize.

During Droid Factory episodes:

We learn the super tank is a secret weapon

Only prototypes exist at this one droid factory

There armor is completely impenetrable

With the destruction of the factory in the episode and capture of Poggle, it make sense why we’d never see them again.

(This is easily my third viewing of Clone Wars and this only just occurred to me as a possibility.)"

0,"So a lot of people believe that force healing makes anakins loss of padme pointless because he could just force heal her. But force healing is actually described as sharing force energy by Rey. Now there’s a popular theory that palpatine took energy from padme to save Vader, killing her. Now this is force healing. Palpatine took the energy from padme and gave it to Vader to heal him. Maybe because he didn’t want to share his own energy. We also know that saving someone from the dead with force healing kills yourself, as seen with Ben and Rey. But healing a scar or non fatal slice won’t kill you. Rey heals Kylos cut, grogu healed greefs cut. Because none of them were dead, it was only a cut that would probably take more time to actually kill them. And as for qui gon and obi wan, I don’t think the Jedi would actually teach force healing. It invalidates the no attachments rule. I have a theory that the Jedi didn’t make force healing public since people would lose faith, thinking their code is nonsense. So obi wan wouldn’t know force healing. And also, qui gon was dead by the time obi wan got to him. And we know that healing from death kills yourself.

So yeah, palpatine force healed anakin by killing padme like how Ben solo gave his life to save Rey. Because force healing is actually sharing energy, not just a heal."
1,"One of the things that I don't really understand about the supernova is that it feels like it's portrayed as more devastating than it ought to be. That's not to minimize the destruction of the Romulan system, but a supernova ought to not take out anything but the system that it's in, and surely the Romulans controlled (and colonized) several other systems.

The loss of Romulus would be a huge blow to the empire, but human history has shown us how the seat of power will move if the current capital is lost. Surely there would have been enough of a government left (senators traveling off-world, leaders of colonies, etc.) for there to be some aspect of the empire left. I mean, hell, the Tal Shiar is still operating.

(This being said, I can also imagine petty warlords trying to step into the power vacuum, or the Klingons taking the opportunity to annex a few systems, too.)"
1,"Right its not your usual post about how awful the first series is of tng but quite the opposite in fact.

0,"So recently I’ve discovered that some people believe Jar Jar, Watto, Nute Gunray and the Trade Federation were racist caricatures. While I can KIND OF see where they’re coming from, I believe many of these criticisms are far fetched. The one I can see the most is Watto. 

This made me wonder if Disney would ever add a content warning on the film AND episodes of the Clone Wars featuring these characters. Do you think the criticisms would warrant this? Do you think the characters are racist stereotypes?"

0,"Quotes: 

**1)  ""He's more machine now than man; twisted and evil"" Obi-Wan, Episode VI**

Alot of people keep thinking Obi says this in IV and use it as a basing point for ""well how did he know this about Vader ?. . . he must have met with him before ANH"" but it actually happens in ROTJ when Obi is a force ghost. Not only had Kenobi fought Vader since then but so has Luke AND Ahsoka. Ahsoka fought Vader in the Rebels TV show. She also communicates with Yoda during the series which takes prior to episode IV - this can be probable cause that Yoda &amp; Obi-Wan knew about Vader and his cyborg body through Ahsoka before ANH **without** Obi-Wan actually meeting with Vader. 

I would also like to put out there that there could be reasonable grounds that word got out about Vader's cyborg enhancements throughout the galaxy via encounters, battles, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)  ""I sense something. A presence I've not felt since..."" Vader, Episode IV**

This quote is a major talking point for why Vader did meet Obi-Wan AND, the flip-side, why Vader did not meet Obi-Wan - and both sides are not entirely correct (at least regarding to Disney canon). This quote does not necessarily pin-point the last time they met physically or otherwise. HOWEVER, it is HEAVILY implied that he meant their duel on Mustafar.

Some people have said that this quote is maybe referring the twins but that is simply not true. In the next scene of Vader after this quote he has a conversation with Tarkin: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK4sZzoycOc&amp;disable\_polymer=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK4sZzoycOc&amp;disable_polymer=1)

&amp;#x200B;

***Dialogue from the scene:***  

**Vader :** He is here.

**Tarkin :** Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?

V : A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

**T :** Surely he must be dead by now.

**V :** Don't underestimate the Force.

**T :** The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.

*\[answering a comm signal\]* 

**T :** Yes?

**Voice on comm :** We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.

**T :** The Princess? Put all sections on alert.

**V :** Obi-wan is here. The Force is with him.

**T :** If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.

V**:** Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

It is obvious from the dialogue that it was indeed Vader sensing Obi-Wan's presence. Tarkin implies that he thought Obi-Wan died many years ago

&amp;#x200B;

3)  ""**Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the Dark Side! I must obey my master"" Vader, Episode VI**

I have seen lots of people have ask when did Obi-Wan want to turn Vader/Anakin back to the lightside. The answer is very simple; during the ROTS, before Anakin's and Kenobi's duel Kenobi says ""Palpatine is evil"", ""Well, then you are lost"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**4)  ""I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you I was but the learner. Now, I am the master""  Vader,  Episode IV**

Now for the most important quote. ""When I left you**"".** When did he leave Obi-Wan? Well it is Obi-Wan who left Anakin/Vader on Mustafar BUT it is on Mustafar when it is absolutely apparent to Kenobi that Anakin left him and the lightside of the force. It is apparent to **both** of them -""You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you"", "" You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them"", "" I have failed you, Anakin; I have failed you"","" This is the end for you, my master"", ""I hate you"" - It is emotional for both of them. Kenobi losing a brother and Anakin/Vader resenting Obi-Wan ^(and himself). 

It does not make sense for Vader &amp; Obi to meet up after Mustafar and to have Vader to leave him. Infact it was a big concern for Vader to find Kenobi between III &amp; IV. Here is a clip from Rebels: [https://youtu.be/RVJrhYr91Bg](https://youtu.be/RVJrhYr91Bg)

The ""learner"" and ""master"" part just means Obi-Wans tutelage &amp; and mentorship over Anakin. Yes Anakin was a jedi knight, yes Anakin should have gotten the seat on the council as a Master, however, Anakin still had a lot to learn - he did infact lose his duel with Kenobi because he was too arrogant. It can also be looked at like  master=winner of the duel, learner=loser of the duel. Also, masters often sought advice from other masters and being that Kenobi **WAS** Anakin's master as a padawan it makes sense that he used those words in the quote. 

""We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete"". This is an vital part that alot of people leave out of the quote. It has the same meaning, when it is combined with the whole quote, as 'the tables have turned'.

The most key part is the ""at last"" - this indicates he has not seen him (at least not physically) since he was the learner and Kenobi was the master. Some might say that they could meet shortly after the events of episode III when Vader is still learning about the darkside but the series is supposed to take place 10 years after ROTS as per Katherine Kennedy's quote "" Obi-Wan Kenobi' begins 10 years after the dramatic events of 'Revenge of the Sith"" . 

# 'Why is it so important to have Darth Vader and Kenobi NOT meet between ROTS &amp; ANH?'

Because it completely ruins the magic of the *very first* lightsaber fight on screen. Watching the two duke it out knowing that so much rides on the duel, knowing that they haven't fought since Luke was born, knowing that it was a long time coming, is completely essential to the duel. So much weight is added to the scene, why would you want to remove that? It builds on their characters, on who they are  during that time, the choices that they made up to that point. 

If they were to simply write over that then who is to say that they cannot write over *anything else* in any other movie or medium. What's to say that one year from now, five years, decades even - they rewrite your favorite scene. It could be from the prequels or the sequels - doesn't matter. If they rewrite those scenes or even knowing that they could rewrite those scenes in the future, important scenes that define different structures of what makes Star Wars, then what the fuck is the point of having those scenes or having *ANY* scene.

&amp;#x200B;

# How I want Obi-Wan and Vader to meet in the Kenobi series

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want them to meet physically, unless it's Kenobi leaning over a corner to look at Vader and say ""Hello there"" to provoke Vader (mostly joking here, *mostly*). What I would like to see is something like Vader sensing or realizing that Obi-Wan is on a Star Destroyer nearby about to make his escape off the ship and Vader frantically flies his Tie into the Star Destroyer's hanger bay, crashing it and jumping out, and then Vader starts a rampaging run towards Obi-Wan - destroying everything in his path, throwing stormtroopers out of the way, ripping through doors and walls with the force just to get to him but somehow old Ben escapes in time. 

If they have to fight, and it looks like they will with Katherine Kennedy's quote "" This will be the rematch of the century"", I hope it is through force visions only."
0,"If this isn’t allowed, I apologize! Please let me know where I might be able to find/ask about this information instead, thank you!!

I’m working on a design project right now, and I’m trying to find out which fauna on the planet Mustafar would be considered dangerous. While I’ve found info on the fauna, I can’t find clear info on which would be dangerous or not. 

Here’s the current list of species I have: darkghast, fire rat, krishel, lava eel, lava flea, lava nymph, lizard-crow, beetle (Mustafar beetles), roggwart, spark-roach, and xandank. 

I haven’t...... seen any movies or consumed any Star Wars-related media (I’m so sorry) so I don’t know and couldn’t know any of this. my professor DOES know most of it (he does this project every year), and will more than likely notice something like this.

in terms of “dangerous,” I mean dangerous for people (or... similar?). if you’re curious, the project is to make a travel poster/promotion for the planet assigned. since it may not be an ideal travel location, I want to have a decent amount of focus on what NOT to do/see if one were to visit the planet lol"

0,"I am trying for the life of me, trying to understand why there are hoards of fans and Johnson who support this. Given the information that we had in the movie.  Kylo didn't do anything nice or selfless for Rey. He kidnapped her, hurled her into a tree knocking her out, killed his father right in front of her. Then put her only friend into a coma when said friend was protecting her.

Next time they see each other she is making googly eyes and touching his hand. Next time we see them he joins forced with her just to have more power to over take Snoke, and when she doesn't say it is okay that he kills everyone he goes back to fighting her... after calling her nothing.  

Then from their he literally stalks her all over the universe . Only doing one good thing at the end. 

I have not lied, I have said what was displayed in the movie. So how does a love story come from that."
1,"In this episode Neelix dies. With the science expertise of 7 of 9 they manage to bring Neelix back to life after an 18 hour picnic among those who have breathed their last breath.

Neelix dies during a Shuttle Mission with Paris and Chakotay there. They recorded it. At one point Neelix, just freshly among the living again, reviews the footage from the away mission. Chakotay has Neelix relive his death as if there's nothing wrong, and doesn't bat an eye when this obviously freaks Neelix out. ""What's wrong?"" What do you think is wrong Chakotay? The guy just saw himself bite it. He gives a nihilistic reasoning after. No one cares.

The episode continues with a ceremony commemorating Neelix's death as he joins his lost family one scene after he confesses to a crewmate there was no afterlife. Everyone is shocked when he loses it.

It's dehumanizing and tone-deaf. I can't believe Trek writers thought this was worth doing. Wow."
1,"This might get some hate but I really don't think the doctor saw his family as an actual family. He admits in the start of the episode that its a project to help him understand patients better and while he does become more involved/invested in it than he thought imo they never become real family to him and here is my reasoning.

His daughter has a terrible accident and is now dying, he tries to save her within the parameters of the program/experiment but beyond that tried to abbandon them, and then finally after speaking with tom paris to let it play out to completion. Thing is though if he genuinly cared for them he would not allow some arbitrairy moral opinion to prevent him from simply changing the program so that she is no longer injured, he essentially has Q-powers in this world hes made and rather than do everything at his disposal to save her he puts his own experience at an authentic human family ahead of her life.

To me that ether means 1. The writing was not good 2. Hes a sociopath 3. He never really saw them as a real family.

Ik and I'm overthinking it tbh I just wanted to see what everyone elses thoughts where on it. I think personally a MUCH better ending would have been that events are written so the tom paris rescue and death scene co-incide at the same point, after she dies the doctor says ""fuck it, shes more important"" and tries to change reality BUT the astral eddies outside damage the ship casuing some pwoer overload or whatever, and since hes trying to to re-write his daughters story at the time its her code/character data that becomes corrupted and is lost. Or if the writers had wanted to justify forgetting the doctors family existed (a repeated problem of voyager in a lot of things i know) the whole program could have been corrupted buy the surge with them all being erased, then you would have had a canonic reason for them never appearing again.

That way you have a doctor who cares for his family, dramatic death AND tried to do everything to save her, like a real person would."
1,"I have been reading posts for quite some time, yet this is my first post.

I enjoy roleplaying games and I have a new crew that wants to set a game in the post-DS9 world on the other side of the Wormhole.  The idea is, much like DS9, to set the game based out of a starbase, but specifically a Federation starbase.

The question I have for the hivemind is this -- since the UFP is a post-scarcity economy, what would businesses be like on such a starbase?  Would locals, say roughly the equivalent of Bajorans, be allowed to open shops there?  And how would UFP citizens pay for such exchanges?  For that matter, what would locals be able to sell that would not be recreated via replicators?

I have several ideas floating around, but I would love to hear other notions  :-)"
1,"I'm a sucker for non-canon starships in Star Trek games, especially those set in the late 23rd century.

This rough hand drawing takes its cues from the [Yamato-class Battleship (Star Trek: Starfleet Command)](https://www.deviantart.com/jetfreak-7/art/Yamato-Class-BB-189113581), the [Ark Royal-class Carrier (Star Trek: Starfleet Command II)](https://www.deviantart.com/quantumdesignsaz/art/U-S-S-Ark-Royal-748093852), and the [Proxima-class Starship (Star Trek: Legacy)](https://www.deviantart.com/al-proto/art/Close-Up-Proxima-739891156).

[Yamato - Ark Royal - Proxima Hybrid](https://www.deviantart.com/torlek1/art/Yamato-Ark-Royal-Proxima-Hybrid-875069569)

One pet peeve this gamer has with larger starships in the games is that their saucer sections aren't tall enough to have shuttlebays along their edges.  The canonical Constellation-class starship is unique in this regard.  This hybrid's saucer is equally tall and has shuttlebays accordingly.

The top two secondary hulls are dedicated to shuttlebays, just like the ones on the Ark Royal.

The bottom two secondary hulls support the assault phasers and provide power to the rest of the behemoth, just like the ones on the 854-meter-long Yamato.

Unlike the Yamato, Ark Royal, or Proxima, this hybrid has two additional warp nacelles.

Undecided: Whether the three warp nacelle pylons should have weapon emplacements between the nacelles, just like the Constellation-class.

[Feel free to develop this ship further, but please render it first into a black-and-white schematic and bounce ideas off with the OP.  Thanks!]"
1,From any of the shows I mean.
1,"I'm doing a Chronological time-line of all the trek episodes and movies.  So far I'm at DS9 s6 / Voy s4.  Then out of nowhere, BOOM!  The N bomb, although in historical context, but still.  Is that like... allowed for (checks actual episode rating) TV-PG?!?!"
1,"Like are you just shitting on the door, or what if your get laid, are you just going to leave a deposit on the floor?"
0,"*(Note: This is not counting the Clone Wars movies)*

**11. Rise of Skywalker:** A plot hole ridden messy film, we're somehow meant to believe Palpatine returned and was conducting all of this behind the scenes. This film alone single handedly destroyed all of Star Wars by literally giving Anakin Skywalker's story to Rey (the biggest mary sue in all of cinema) who is somehow Palpatines granddaughter it's also an insult to the franchise that Anakin wasn't featured in the film at all. Don't watch this one (or any of the sequel trilogy).

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Last Jedi:** Terrible writing, the film makes no sense and the characters are awful, Kylo Ren our new ""badass"" ""Villain"" is just a whiny bitch, hardly any character development. And again this film like the entire sequel trilogy butchers the Skywalker story as Rey is left as the ""Last Jedi"" once Luke Skywalker dies. Don't watch this one (or any of the sequel trilogy).

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Force Awakens:** The entire film is just a shitty rehash of A New Hope, its all just fan service and nothing more and nothing less, really its just fan fiction with one good character that being Finn. Back in 2015 when this film came out I was excited as hell but left with an unmatchable level of disappointment. The biggest issue is the one which its two even worse sequels suffers from as well (I'll leave you to figure that one out). Don't watch this one (or any of the sequel trilogy).

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Phantom Menace:** There are no character traits in this movie, no clear protagonist, the dialogue is very rough, its incredibly boring with an overly confusing plot which is all about politics when Star Wars is meant to be for kids (what kind of kid wants to watch a movie about boring old politics) and if you take this film out of the prequel trilogy it still changes nothing. However it has a badass soundtrack and a really really really good final battle which is my favorite lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars but other than that its a shitty film. Not even gonna mention you know him. I remember being so excited to go and see this as an 11 year old and actually liking it up until my early teen years.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Attack of the Clones:** What can I say about this which hasn't already been said, the worst dialogue in all of the films and poor acting. The Obi Wan storyline is ok but Count Dooku is not a threatening character at all which is a shame since Christopher Lee's acting is top notch. Palpatine's plan makes no sense and his assassination attempts on Padme just randomly stop just so Anakin &amp; Padme can have an awful romance storyline where they spit bad cringey dialogue and seeing Yoda in the end with a lightsaber saddens me because it goes against his entire character and the battle between Dooku v Anakin/Obi Wan/Yoda is awful however the Geonosian arena battle is pretty good. This film also made improvements over its predecessor in that it features a thing called character traits and also has less of the worst character in the prequel trilogy (not gonna mention his name). Bad film nonetheless. Even when it came out I didn't like it since I was 14 and had matured.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Solo A Star Wars Story:** Now we're getting into the good films and its refreshing since talking about the crap ones was making me upset. I really love seeing the backstory of my favorite character in the entire franchise Han Solo. Its just a fun heist movie movie and I had a good time watching it but I do get why some people might not like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Return of the Jedi:** Not as as good as episode's 4/5 but still a great film and leaves the trilogy off at a satisfying conclusion. It has my personal favorite duel from the original 3 films in the end with Vader v Luke and then Vader's redemption, of course there is some bad such as Hans personality basically being deleted, and all the scenes with the Ewoks but other than that one of the better threequels you will find..

&amp;#x200B;

**4. A New Hope:** Prior to 1977 a film of this kind simply didn't exist and while I wasn't alive for it I can remember the first time I watched Star Wars when I was about 4 or 5 this was before Phantom Menace mind you, I can remember being in love and for years this was what sparked mine and pretty much everyone's obsession with Star Wars. Too bad this film has been butchered by the constant changing of the special editions.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Rogue One:** I went into this film thinking it would suck as I really hated Force Awakens but then it started, it introduced us to a new crew of great characters, so much emotion behind it especially since you already know from the get go that all of these characters will end up dead and the whole time you are dreading it. It has a great story that ties into A New Hope perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Empire Strikes Back:** This was my favorite until my number 1 came along. Definitely the perfect example on how to make a sequel and a darker one too. It builds upon everything established in A New Hope and introduces new stuff, perfect world building and has possibly the biggest reveal in all of cinema. I was so tempted to put this one at no. 1 but...

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Revenge of the Sith:** I must be one of the few people who never actually hated this film, I was 17 when this came out and it has been my favorite since 2005. Definitely the darkest of all the Star Wars films, the most emotional one, the biggest upgrade out of any sequel I've ever seen (since its two predecessors are garbage), we finally get to see the Clone Wars, Anakin's darkside turn and how everything came to be how it is in the later films, however its not perfect as it still has some pretty bad dialogue, too much CGI (even if its really good cg), the way Yoda &amp; Obi Wan just give up is not very convincing and the film doesn't have a good sense of how much time has passed (granted most of the films don't) and the fight between Yoda &amp; the Emperor is just....no. The awesome final battle between Obi Wan &amp; Anakin has definitely the most emotion behind it out of any battle in all of Star Wars and the scene of where Anakin burns still brings me to tears. Never hated this one, and this one has always been my favorite. When you finish the nightmare of Eps 1 &amp; 2 you will find the threequel is a definite upgrade and a big one of that.

Leave your ranking down below, do you agree or disagree? comment below."
1,When in DS9 for example Nog says to Vic “I’ll leave your program running 6 hours a day” what does that mean? An exaggeration or literal?
1,"I'm not saying she's better or worse than Dr. Crusher, I'm just saying I wasn't bothered by her character in anyway and actually enjoyed her portrayal. How about you?"
1,Rewatching Chain of Comand and I must applaud Mr Cox for his performance as Edward Jellico. In less than 15 minutes he became the most hated character in the two part episode. Mr Cox would use this attitude in later years as Senator Kinsy in Stargate SG1.
0,"Hey there, sorry if this has been asked already or the information is already out there to read, but I have a couple questions about the Mandalorian training process. I’m currently trying to write out a kinda-prequel comic to The Mandalorian and I’m currently doing research to make sure I nail all the boxes correctly. I’m just going to list my questions in and if anyone has the answers or knows of a wiki or website that does, please let me know! Thank you in advance!!

- Do the Children of the Watch always mandate that helmets are worn by their foundlings/those who join them, or just by those training to be Mandalorians?

- How long would the training take place for? Are there different sectors of training? (I know Din Djarin says he was trained in the “fighting corps” when he is talking about his training in the season 1 finale, so what if there are more?) 
Are they always required to fight if they choose to not become mercenaries or bounty hunters?

- Are the colors of Mandalorian armor significant to others in the culture? Do they get to choose the colors or is it mandated by what materials they bring in or have (beskar v durasteel)?

- Are the armourers the only ones who cast can the helmets/armor? When are Mandalorians even supposed to receive their helmets (i.e. when done training or when they finished growing)? 

- Do Mandalorians always have to donate a portion of their financial income to their tribes? Or can they receive training and then just leave the tribe (kinda a jerk move but I need to know)?

- Are all “official” Mandalorians required to make a trip or have a connection to Mandalore? It doesn’t seem so but they all seem to have either been on the planet at some point, want to go back and reclaim it, etc.

Again, sorry if these questions seem kinda dumb or have been answered elsewhere, and thank you again for any sort of feedback or input!"
0,"Non-canon open world mp where your created character has one life. There is no power cap so you could be the most powerfull sith/jedi of all time, but if you die that character is gone for good, and you have to make a new one. The game would be Republic vs Seperatists and your objectives consists mostly of pve against the enemy AI. But you could stumble upon any player while doing so, so there will be a pvp element. Of course running is an option
Comment your thoughts bellow. Is thos a good idea? Should some things be changed?"
1,"This isn't meant as yet another ""new trek"" bashing post but it's just something that popped into my head as I was watching some older sci-fi shows. I know that television in general has changed to favor long, dramatic story arcs and all that nonsense and it definitely works when it comes to star trek (I loved the dominion War for example) but there's no reason why we can't have both. A lot of my favorite X-Files episodes were the random ""monster of the week"" episodes, a lot of the Stargate episodes that didn't involve the series' main antagonist were really fun and refreshing, and so much of what I loved about classic trek was them just exploring those strange new worlds and seeing what was out there. I'd really love to see the new Pike show go back to the way things used to be (at least a little) but I'm not terribly optimistic with the way everything else is going."
1,"The exchange between Sisko and Bashir after Bashir grills Ducat about him leaving Cardassian children on Bajor after the occupation is marvelous.   

Bashir:   *I'm sorry, Commander. It just seemed an opportune–*""

  
Sisko:  ""*Don't apologize; it's been the high point of my day.* Don't *do it again.*"""
0,"Skipping the fence from D&amp;D DMing to here, I want to run a game for my friends with SW5e, BUT, I'm not savy on SW lore, I watched the movies (except rise of skywalker because last jedi was trash), the Clone Wars show and the Mandalorian, but after a chat with a real fan (who reads the comics and novels) I feel like there's still a ton of lore I'm not savy to.

Can anyone recommend a book or means to learn lore without having to jump from comic to comic or novel to novel?"
0,"So I finally finished Rebels this weekend and if I'm being honest, it was an okay show. I enjoyed the really important episodes that moved the plot forward, but there were a lot of episodes that, imo, were filler and I didn't necessarily care for. I loved the callbacks to the OT, Prequels, and TCW and I enjoyed learning more of the lore behind the Force between the Jedi and Sith. Enjoyed the special guest appearances by certain characters and I enjoyed the lightsaber battles that we got. Overall, I'm glad I've finally watched the show as well as TCW to expand my knowledge on SW outside of the movies and I'm looking forward to getting into more content."
0,"How many living beings were on separatist ships? They seem to have oxygen in them, and we see admirals and commanders on them. But how many normal crewmen? I’d imagine it would get super lonely if it was just a captain with a few hundred walking computers to keep him company."
1,"I remember it was advertising TNG and Andy Griffith airing back-to-back on weeknights a 9/10.

It started with Worf “Incoming message from Mintaka III” and I think when they put it on the view screen it was Ernest T. Bass.

At one point the phone in Data’s chest was ringing, and when Picard answered it, it cut to Barney Fife talking into the old school phone saying “Hello sweetie” and then back to Picard shouting “Who is this???”

I’ve searched and searched YouTube with no luck. I don’t really know how to go about searching for old local commercials though. Anyone know where I could find it?"
0,"My argument is that the Jedi council are the real reason for Anakin falling to the dark side rather than the sith. Now I don’t believe this justifies his actions but it makes sense. The Jedi Council constantly belittled Anakin, not seeing him as one of their own. They wouldn’t save his mother’s life nor would they let him do it either, because her life was insignificant to them and not important. Anakin tried to become a master so he could have the “rank” to do so himself but wouldn’t grant him permission to do so. They held him back from his training and treated him like a joke. They only were concerned with politics and adhering to the senate. Anakin believed Palpatine was the only person who tried to help him save his wife after his trusted “friends” and “comrades” wouldn’t. Anakin shouldn’t have gave in to the dark side regardless but his constant rejection, fear and lack of help from the Jedi is what drove him to fall. Obi-wan was his best friend and older brother figure and not even he stood up for Anakin when he needed him. If it wasn’t for Anakins turn to the dark side who knows how different things could have been especially for Luke’s story as well. What do you guys think?"
1,"What if janeway went into a downward spiral after marooning voyager into the delta quadrant.  So much so that the she started drinking like a fish and couldn't stop.  She would show up on the bridge completely wasted.  And unable to string together coherent sentences.  And no one could relieve her of command because they are short on captains and there no admirals in the delta quadrant.  Yeah chakotay could relieve her of command.  But what if she poisoned him and can activate the poison with the touch of a button.  And what if she modified the doctor's program so he wouldn't relieve her of duty.  

So then you've got a ship who's captain is wasted most of he time.  On a collision course with disaster.  And the two people who could relieve her of command have been coerced not to.  That would have made voyager a more interesting show.  I can only imagine voyager trying to confront the borg with janeway totally wasted and incoherence.  It sounds like something sfdebris would come up with it.  I think it would have made voyager more entertaining.  Let me know what you think in the comments."
0,"Mine are 1: Dorwin Corvax’s because it is such a beautiful, elegant lightsaber that looks like a steampunk statue. 2: Quinlan Vos’ because it is sleek and discreet and beautiful. And finally 3: maul’s old master lightsaber because it looks super cool.

What about yours?"
0,"Hey y'all, I recently got Disney+ and I want to watch all Star Wars films but I don't know which Trilogy I should watch first. Should I do it Chronologically in terms of Prequel first or do it by release dates. Also where does Rogue One fall in place?"
0,"I envision the same slouching hooded figure, but now his robes are purple crushed velvet with a zebra skin belt. If I was able to draw anything better than a stick figure I’d give it a shot."
0,"Hi All,

I'm doing a quiz tonight and I want to do a topic on the top 10 most appearances by a Star Wars character in any star wars project based on the most screen time. Does anyone know anywhere I can find this info?

Happy to limit it to the current mainstream films but preferably all media if possible"

1,"This is the only Star Trek episode I've seen - and at the end of it, Spock says:

""It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt that you will find it or make it yourselves.""

We learn earlier that the planet they find in Romulan space under Dr. Sevrin's command was named Eden and made up completely of acid. 

So then why wasn't that the Eden they were looking for? And of all substances the planet could of consisted of - why acid? And by what means could Irina and the remnants of One create their own Eden? Also why was this episode rated most lame amidst the rest? And lastly, what, if any, true differences lie between those aboard the Enterprise and those of One in search of the motherland?"
0,"I just finished TCW and it's as saddening as the end of any 10/10 show/movie. Currently re-watching ROTS before starting Rebels today.  
  
Alongside The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Rome, Killing Eve, The Shield, Band of Brothers, The Wire and endless other incredible shows, TCW belongs with the best. This is just an appreciation post and this show will be watched forever by young and old people, truly timeless."
1,"I just watched the episode Field of Fire (season 7), and a number of things in this episode annoy me. What do others think?

Ezri becomes the primary investigator when several murders take place. Shouldn't someone in security be in charge? Odo? Ezri is a counselor. Her qualifications seem to be that one of her hosts was a murderer. I'm not saying she can't contribute, but seems weird that she's basically in charge. (Ok, I know Odo's involved... it just feels like it's all Ezri here.)

O'Brien made that weapon way too easily. We all know he's a great engineer, it sounds like he just took a few parts off a shelf and stuck them together with a gun. Those parts were a micro-transporter, and an eyepiece that lets you see through walls. Those are amazing bits of technology that we've never seen before, and it seems like O'Brien just had them sitting on a shelf somewhere.

Micro transporter: so now there's a transporter for beaming small things that can fit in your pocket. This would be an absolutely amazing tool in so many situations. But we never saw it before this episode, or ever again.

Eyepiece that lets you look through walls: Aside from questions about how such a thing could even work, what about privacy concerns? You can literally use this to look inside of anyone's quarters whenever you want. And Ezri does exactly that! I get that murder is being investigated, but there should be some oversight... something like a warrant, perhaps.

Ezri concludes that the assailant is probably a Vulcan because all the victims had smiling pictures in their quarters. Right or wrong, that reasoning is hugely racist. After making this conclusion, she immediately goes to spy on the Vulcan she suspects. She should at least have called security at some point to explain her suspicion, and to get some backup if needed.

And lastly, although not really specific to this episode, we see that Dax can basically recite some incantation and then say the name of a previous host three times in a mirror, and they will appear. On the one hand, this seems silly. On the other hand, it makes me sad she never does this to talk with Jadzia.

Ok, that's my rant. What do you think?"
0,i got a new reddit for people who are left out: r/MilleniumFalcon
0,"I tried posting this in the Mandela Effect but was downvoted to zero and ignored.  All good.  No expectations.

Did Poe Dameron exist before ""The Force Awakens"" in some kind of EU capacity?

I have absolutely vivid and recurring memories of calling my friend Po, ""Po Dameron"" \[sic\].  This is from the early 2000s.  Why?  I tried looking for other characters named Po and it's none of those.

Does anyone have any insight in to this?"
1,"Why do the Abrams Treks get shit on so much?

I’m re-watching the Abrams Treks after watching TOS and movies for the first time and the characters and spirit of TOS seem totally there. Why do people hate these movies?"
0,"Ahsoka is one of the most developed characters in Star Wars. and her journey from Jedi Padawan to non-aligned Force Master is really interesting.

her non begin a Jedi or a Sith open MANY possibilities for future stories. and an interesting way to show her ""unorthodox"" alignment in the Force would be having her use Electric Judgement.

Electric Judgement is the Light Side version of Force Lightning. less deadly, but still capable of stunning a target. instead of begin fueled by malice and hate like Force Lightning, Electric Judgement is fueled by a sense of determined justice. something Ahsoka Tano possess in great quantity.

this power is considered ""forbidden"" by the Jedi Order, but some of his members were able to use it. the most famous user of Electric Judgement is Master Plo Koon. somone really close to Ahsoka and one of her greatest mentors.

Ahsoka learning to use Electric Judgement would show how far she is gone in her journey, and how she is now equal to her mentor. at the same time, Ahsoka using a ""forbidden"" Force Power would show how she is gone beyond the Jedi doctrine and become more indipendent."
1,"Has anyone heard if or when we may finally get all the Star Trek Movies on 4k? I know they have been released and re-released on blu ray and the JJ Abrams ones have 4k, but what about the prime timeline?!?"
0,"For a galaxy of people that have mastered intersystem light speed travel, lots of people seem to do most of their shopping at open-air wet markets.

There are lots of hazards to this, wet markets can breed really nasty viruses that could probably impact a whole planet pretty badly.

A possible solution to this is a system of food quality regulation and sanitary grocery stores, which requires a government and a profit motive.

I would say lots of planets (Coruscant, Mandalore, Naboo, Rodia, etc.) fill both these qualifications, and yet we never see a proper grocery store, and instead see grimy markets of people selling warm raw meat.

What’s up with that?"
0,"Keep wondering if this is on YouTube somewhere and if it does where?


Sorry if this is a reposted question. I haven't asked it"
1,"I have a soft spot for Whoopi and her role as Guinan, but I've always been curious: Why was she not officially credited for her appearances in Generations and Nemesis? I've looked online but never seen an official explanation, has she ever said anything about it?"
0,"I just don't understand. She has no character arc, as she starts as an amazing pilot, powerful force user (and is apparently more powerful than Anakin, luke and mace Windo) and she knows how to use a lightsaber so well she was able to kill a fully trained Jedi/sith with near ease. She also just is the best at everything.

If you like Rey or knows someone who does, please explain why they like her."
1,Do any of you know when the star blows up and kills the red shirt guys
1,"I was wondering, what everyone's favourite not-so-well-fleshed-out species are... \[Meaning: No major players like Romulans, Borg, etc.\]

There have been many interesting candidates over the years, most of them we only got to see in one or (at best) a small handful of episodes. Which ones do you think deserve more love and appreciations? Which ones would you like to see make a return?

My vote goes to the Gorn, the Bynars, the Tholians, the Tamarians and the Aenar \[If they even count as a species that is.\]"
1,Like the drastic changes in the borg or the actor who played tom paris also playing nick locarno.  What is something you swear by because it makes the show better for you.
1,"Writing children is always difficult, and I’m always stumped by how not-annoying she is. She’s a curious and likeable child and I enjoy watching her character interact with the crew and develop a lot :)"
1,I was looking into other enterprise's and came across the enterprise z but I dont think its cannon
0,"Watching it today, seemed like a good lunch time Episode, and got to thinking how often it’s watched by others. I watch it a few times a week."
1,"Just wanted to thank Rick for his YouTube channel which provides a bunch of detail to the Star Trek expanded universe. He mainly uses Alpha content but uses Beta content sparingly and Gamma content even more sparingly. 

Cheers to a good channel man!"
1,"Has anyone rewatched Picard on the streaming service or bluray? I have on bluray, and I think the show as a whole works much better when not waiting week-to-week. I was generally pretty favorable on this show, and it has definitely gotten better with rewatches.

I wouldn't trade the weekly discussions about the episodes for anything. They are what made the show enjoyable for me... finally getting to talk Star Trek with other fans again. That said, the structure just made for a better watch without the wait. The first three episodes flow together as a nice prologue. And some of the character decisions and arcs flow more nicely when watching episodes closer together.

Stardust City Rag still stands out like a sore thumb, though. And in my view, it weighs the show down and stunts its pace. The focus on Seven is cool, but she really didn't factor much into the rest of the show in a significant way. And killing Maddux after waiting 5 episodes to find him is still one of the most anti-climatic decisions of the season.

Anyway, just wanted to give some thoughts in case others want to give it a rewatch. I found it flows a lot better."
0,"So going only by the 4 episodes we had so far, who is your favourite? (I tried doing a poll but that didn't work) 

Since Echo had way more screen time than the rest, we're only going by his appearance in those 4 episodes, so imagine he appeared only in that arc."
1,I’m into season 3 and totally hooked on ST doe the first time in my life. I’ll be so sad if it leaves.
1,"Dolim kills Degra. This much we know. He then steals the weapon and flies off with it, the Insectoids following close behind them. The Insectoid councilor hails Dolim, accusing Dolim of being the traitor. The following conversation happens....

&gt; ""The anomalies worked to our advantage.""

&gt; ""We were fortunate.""

&gt; ""It was more than good fortune. The human claims the guardians control the spheres.""

&gt; ""He also started a civil war between our species.""

&gt; ""The human didn't kill Degra. **You** did.""

&gt; ""Degra was a traitor.""

&gt; ""I'm no longer certain of that.""

&gt; ""Well, it's a good thing we already have your launch codes.""

Dolim then orders the Insectoid ship be destroyed.

Later, on Degra's ship, Jannar and the other Primate helping Archer say that the Insectoids are no longer with the Reptilians. This confuses me, because surely if one Insectoid ship were destroyed, the others would find out and quickly take its place. But considering they are gone, it makes me wonder if they switched sides. Memory Alpha says this:

&gt; But when the other species tried to stop them and the Sphere-Builders intervened with the help of a nearby Sphere, the Insectoid councilor began to doubt and started to suspect there was truth in what Captain Archer told the Council.

What are the Insectoids' motives now that the war is over?"
1,"I feel like I am in the minority but...

TNG
DS9
Enterprise
Picard
Voyager
Discovery
Lower Decks
TAS
TOS

I probably rank Enterprise far above most people but I really enjoy it."
1,"S7E12 Vic Fontaine is alive?!?!

In “the emperor’s new cloak” Vic is a living breathing person in the alternate universe. 

How is this possible?! Was it just a McGuffin the writers put in? Or could it mean more? 

If advanced holograms have living alternates this implies that they are truly alive and dare I say it, have souls. 
This means the Doctor and all the “living” holograms in voyager are just as real as you and me. 
Sadly Vic was unceremoniously blasted by evil Bashir and we will never have answers :("

One scene that I just read (almost done with the book) was where Thrawn met Anakin Skywalker. I’ll say that it was probably my favorite part of the book because I wasn’t familiar with the entire Chiss people and their politics and worlds and having a well-known character in the book made it easier for me to comprehend the scene and enjoy it. 

Anyways, for those that have read the book, what is your review of it?"
0,"As a whole of the Prequel Trilogy, one of the top three baffling decisions Lucas made was making Anakin's love interest a *politician*. Her role inevitably separated her character from Anakin's journey as a Jedi, leaving no room for them to grow their love together. Anakin fights because he is a warrior, and Padmé talks with other politicians because she is a politician.

Her role kept changing in each installment has not helped it. She turns from a Queen of Naboo, to a feisty Senator, to Anakin's loyal wife. Her role in ROTS was especially wasted since she had nothing to do other than birthing Luke and Leia. It lacks consistency in her characterization. Compare this to Leia, who was the politician and the princess, but kept her role of the fierce Rebel military leader on the screen consistently. What is worse is that we already have a politician character in the Prequels to show the galactic-wide politics to the audience, and that is Bail Organa. 

Meanwhile, *Ahsoka* in The Clone Wars creates a far interesting character dynamic with Anakin. Be together often as comrades, kicking droid asses, learning, growing, and bonding. They are far more together than Anakin is with Padme. Although we now accept Ahsoka is part of the Prequels, when The Clone Wars first introduced in 2008, the inclusion of Anakin's apprentice in the already established Prequel lore was... a hot potato for a while. She was never mentioned in the films, contributed nothing, felt like an unnecessary addition to the series in the earlier seasons.

There is a way to blend these two concepts together. If Padmé was Anakin's *female Padawan apprentice*, not only it would have made the story far more exciting, it would have justified a lot of elements about Anakin's character arc. For example, Anakin's forbidden romance with his apprentice, Padme, makes more sense than the Jedi dogma forbidding anyone from having a romance. Anakin and his apprentice having to hide their feelings during the battlefield, under the watch of the Jedi Council and Obi-Wan. They develop the master-and-apprentice forbidden love as the war continues, but when the Jedi Council finds out about their relationship, they excommunicate her from the Order like Ashoka's arc in The Clone Wars. You can even have the Jedi Council separating Anakin's children from him, which enrages him to stir away from the Jedi's path.

With this hypothetical Padawan Padmé concept, let's reimagine the trilogy.

In **The Phantom Menace**, the Queen of Naboo should not be Padme. She is a separate character. Maybe set the Naboo setting to Alderaan and call her Breha Antilles. Maybe Padme's character can appear as a minor role, but I do not know how to go about it.

This Jedi Padme gets introduced in **Attack of the Clones**. Before knighting a Padawan Anakin to be a Jedi Knight, the Council decides to test him first. The Council assigns him a mission and a human female Padawan, Padme, to take her as a temporary apprentice. Their initial dynamic plays similarly to The Clone Wars movie. They do not like each other at first but they bond together, develop feelings as they are sent on a mission. Set up the Jedi code that a Jedi cannot fall in love with another Jedi because it would distract a Jedi from doing their duty. The end of Attack of the Clones should not have a full-on marriage between the two but, it should plant a seed for what is to come.

**The Clone Wars** series can explore these two character's growing relationships. Ahsoka and Anakin's dynamic is already present but added with a romantic angle.

In **Revenge of the Sith**, after the battle of Coruscant, Anakin returns to the Jedi Temple. He finds there is a trial going on. This is where you can do the Ahsoka excommunication arc from The Clone Wars. Padme has become pregnant, which causes the Jedi Council to discover the forbidden romance between Anakin and Padme. Obi-Wan, a Jedi Council member, gets summoned as a witness for the trial and gives testimonies on the relationship between Anakin and Padme. Mace Windu wants to outcast both Anakin and Padme, but Obi-Wan at least prevents the Council from excommunicating Anakin. Anakin's chance for a Mastership is gone. Anakin is enraged at the Jedi Council. He enraged at Obi-Wan. All these cause him to turn to the dark side. This is where Palpatine fits in, persuading him that the Jedi will take their child away. This is a far simpler, but effective motivation for him to turn dark than Anakin having a vision about Padme dying, which comes across as rather contrived.

Padme goes a Grey Jedi as Ahsoka did in TCW, which also makes for an interesting storyline for the OT era. They can meet again and duel as Ahsoka did in **Rebels** without retconning Return of the Jedi, in which Leia tells Luke Padme was alive during Leia's childhood. 

What do you think? I think it is an improvement over how romance worked in the trilogy."

0,"So, in case anyone doesn’t yet know: the blonde girl who talks with Clone Force 99 (AKA The Bad Batch) in the recent trailer goes by the name “Omega.” Given that omega is the last letter of the Greek language, the current theory is that she was the last clone grown.

I wanted to share two theories I came up as to where she comes from:

1: She’s an experimental clone of Jango Fett. Given that the Bad Batch show is all about several clones who are genetically modified, it isn’t impossible that one clone was modified to be female.

2: She’s a clone from a different genetic template. In the Season 3 Episode 1 Clone Wars episode *”Clone Cadets”* (coincidentally the episode that intrigues Echo and the derogatory-to-clones term “Bad Batch”), Lama Su reports to Shaak Ti that the Jango Fett DNA is becoming degraded and over-used, and that the Jedi should bring in an alternative genetic template. Perhaps the Jedi found a woman to be a new template to supplement the Jango clones, who ended up being the parent to Omega? It would also mean that she was aged much faster than a double-speed Jango clone, given she looked about ten and couldn’t be older than three (given the length of the clone wars).

I also feel that she looks distinctly Mandalorian with her blonde hair (similar to Satine, but not saying they’re genetically related).

So character devolpment works a little bit differently.

I understand even Strange New Worlds that is supposed to be more similar in tone to older shows is going to have a pretty short season.  

Why is that? How could a show in the 90's make 25 episodes in a year and nowadays they can only make half of that? Are actors paid more or do effects take longer to make or do networks just not want to buy longer seasons?"

1,"I was reflecting today about how we have a lot of conversations comparing different Treks, but we don’t compare Treks to the media landscape at the time of their creation. I think it’s an important lens to view from.

I don’t necessarily want to focus on 1:1 relationships  (ST:TMP was obviously emulating 2001 A Space Odyssey, DS9 was related to Babylon 5, Lower Decks and Rick &amp; Morty, etc). I’m more interested in general genre and form of the era. So what was the most popular tv/film form of each era, and how did it influence these shows?  


* **TOS - The Western**. Yes, TOS shared many similarities with The Twilight Zone, but TOS was more often sharing the airwaves with shows like Bonanza, Gunsmoke, and The Rifleman. A working title for Gene Roddenberry’s new show was “Wagon Train to the Stars.” Just like these shows, TOS focused on the virtue and strengths of it’s leading man. Westerns featured mustache twirling villains, mono-cultural indians, and admiring women, and some of these elements made their way into Star Trek.
* **TNG/DS9/VOY - The Sitcom**. u/A_Bird_Soaring ‘s post last week made me think of this - they pointed out that in each episode, the captain leads the whole crew through the philosophy or morality of a given situation, weighing different perspectives. The story structure, the carpet, the “very special episodes,” and the emphasis on discussion all point to the Sitcom. And the inclusion of children/family on ships (Alexander, Jake/Nog, Naomi) created a focus on “targeted, all ages content”  - as well as an increased emphasis of these crews as blended families themselves.
* **DISC/STP - The Superhero Movie**. I’m not the first to point this out, but these new shows with serialized narratives, heightened action elements, increased special effects, macguffins, and emphasis on world-ending (or Federation-ending) stakes are all elements of the modern action movie, especially a Marvel movie. Instead of the family of the crew, we focus on the main character and their antagonist. The twists and turns in each episode, building on previous episodes, is very reminiscent of comic books themselves.

I think this analysis can lead to interesting discussions - both about how these shows reflect, and reject, the shows they shared the airwaves with. But too often it seems we divorce these shows from their times, which I think does a disservice. It leads to unrealistic expectations, or creates misguided arguments of what “is or isn’t Star Trek.” The only way for a show to be greenlit is for producers to pitch something that reflects what’s popular; what we can hope for is that they take the best of what’s popular, rather than parroting the worst. We inevitably get some of both.

Looking forward to thoughts you all have below - What do you notice by comparing TNG to Full House, or STP to Captain America? Or is that an unhelpful comparison? Where does ENT fit in? 

Anyways, Lower Decks is the best Star Trek show ever made and anyone who disagrees with me is OBJECTIVELY WRONG :p /s"

1,"So I know that Star Trek has gone through a lot of general changes in terms of how everything looks. ToS to TNG, DS9, VOY was a change, then from there another change with Enterprise. I feel like ToS to TNG's change made sense. But everything always looked so comfy. Why wouldn't I want to join Starfleet? Rewarding position exploring the galaxy, saving lives and learning new things, all while being on a comfy looking ship.

Enterprise came out, and the lack of comfort made sense because it played into how archaic that era was compared to Picard's era. It was during a time where we were just dipping our toes into space and everything looked more military when Humanity hadn't become as peaceful as they were in TNG. 

Then came the Abrams films where they traded this comforting looking ship for a generic scifi look. This bothers me because I feel Star Treks beauty came from the fact that we were evolved to be better than we are now. The comforting environment represents how we have grown as a species in a technological sense. That we could still have huge warships capable of great destruction but yet still make it a comforting area to be in. Also who wants to fly in space for years at a time in a big metal box? That ""Space Hotel"" look the TNG, DS9, VOY ships had made Star Trek distinguishable from all other SciFi shows and movies.

I hate that the comfy aesthetic is gone since the Abrams films and I really wish they found a way to bring it back.

The only thing that has come close was Lower Decks but I can't take it seriously as it is a comedy show, and an arguably just okay one."

0," Ok so like this is something that I always have to think about whenever I see her character develop. Like I get everyone loves her and rightfully so but how strong is she actually. She is a very talented lightsaber duellist but still not as good as Vader as seen in Twilight of the Apprentice where he would’ve killed her if not for Ezra ex machina. And in terms of force abilities her knowledge never went further than that of a Padawan as well as not having access to the Jedi archives to learn from masters such as Jo-Casta after TCW where she leaves the order. So relatively who is she on par with? Dooku as a duellist would make sense as they both lost to Vader, but in terms of strength in the force is she even as high as some of the lower Jedi Masters or more established Knights?"

1,"Hello again all. Due to the overwhelming positivity I had regarding [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/lmgv41/i_just_watched_my_first_ever_episode_of_star_trek/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I figured you would all like an update on my journey so far into TNG. I’ll warn you now, though, it’s a bit of a long post. So far I’ve watched the first 10 episodes of season 1 and would like to share a couple thoughts I’ve had while watching it thus far. (As a side note before I begin- I would like to say thank you to everyone who recommended that I should use a watch list instead of every episode, but I have to politely decline. I am just one who thinks that watching the bad episodes along with the good ones only enhances how good the good episodes are.... if that makes any sense at all lol)

The Naked Now- I’m sure if I watched TOS first this episode would’ve been more enjoyable to me. I’m unsure how exactly Data got infected, is he part organic? For some reason I thought he was the first truly sentient synthetic life form. Not much else to add to this episode. 

Code of Honor- This episode was.... interesting to say the least. Getting some backstory into Tasha’s past was interesting, however. Was not expecting rape gangs in Star Trek, I was under the impression that the Federation (and humans in general) had grown past such things?

The Last Outpost- After I watched this episode I had to look up when it was released (1987), only to be surprised (more like impressed, actually) that an episode riffing on capitalism released only a few months after Reagan’s “Tear down this wall” speech. Other than making me realize that this show isn’t afraid of making social commentary, I was introduced to the Ferengi... so that’s neat I guess. 

Where No One Has Gone Before- so there’s apparently beings other than the Q who can, to quote another show, do wibbly wobbly ~~timey-wimey~~ space-time alternating things? Also has a nice “the children are our future” message in there too which is always a nice reminder (funny on how that kind of message gets a new meaning every year, right?)

Lonely Among Us- Obligatory “Worf lookin’ pretty sus” line here. In all honesty though this is my favorite episode thus far- all for one simple reason. Sherlock Data (specifically with the pipe) is amazing, and I love Ryker all the more for going ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ whenever anyone was like “what the...”. Already looking like my favorite season 1 episode by far. 

Justice- I’ve heard of ‘prime directive’ episodes, and now I’ve experienced one. Interesting morals about interfering with the progress of a society, and I love how Picard just immediately shoots down the classic train scenario. I haven’t yet mentioned it yet but I think he’s a great captain with a great crew. 

The Battle- The mice people are back and they’re ready for revenge! Or at least they kinda are. I like the backstory about Picard and the world building surrounding headaches/medical advancements, but what I enjoyed most about this episode was the showing that not all “hats” are the same. What I mean is that although the Ferengi are a society of hats, it’s not a one size fits all (something I felt wasn’t done in the series so far). The turn at the end by the Ferengi number 1 had me like “ah, so they aren’t all bad. Good to know!”  

Hide and Q- Q’s back and he’s after Ryker. I like the take on human nature this show is going for- one that likes to strive for achievement and improvement on its own. I also think this is very much a Ryker episode as it, and correct me if I’m wrong, shows that he’s not just a Kirk 2.0 (from Star Trek 2009 and Into Darkness, I feel as though Kirk would’ve taken those powers... and maybe would’ve used them to slap Q around a bit.)

Haven- this was the first episode I wasn’t excited about. I just felt like it kinda went on for hours... I’m not sure why. I’m glad that didn’t get rid of Troy, although deep down I knew she wouldn’t be leaving the show so soon. 

And there’s my general thoughts on TNG so far. Again, I was blown away by the support you all showed on my last post and I’m excited to get to the later seasons. Thanks for listening to my TED Talk."

It’s brilliantly constructed and directed but I don’t like it’s place in the film. It’s the only Star Wars film where I have the exact same opinion now as when I first saw it.

1,"I am just wondering if anybody else had their life shaped by a piece of media in a huge way.

When I was a teen I was suicidal. There was a lot of abuse in my home, with me or my mom being the primary targets. I had no one to turn too for help and the people I lived with were a very poor examples as to how a person should behave. Due to my home life I was very shy and timid which invited bullying and my school life became as much of a hell as my home life. 

I spent a lot of time trying to lose myself in fiction and media. Books, video games, TV shows, movies and music. Science fiction and fantasy where my go-to, and helped me forget about reality. 

TNG quickly became my favorite show. I loved all the characters and loved pretending like I was a part of the crew. The inclusiveness and non-judgemental approaches to problems was inspirational and made me hope that real life people can be like that. 

Captain Picard stood out as my favorite character in fiction because I wished that I could grow up to be like him. I stopped thinking of killing myself and started trying to shape my actions as if I were trying to be like Captain Picard.

It may just be a show, but it is part of the reason I am still alive today. It played a vital role in shaping who I am today. I have re-watched the show maybe 10 times now, and I still like to imagine being part of a family that actually cares about you. 

Sorry if this doesn't fit in here. Just needed to vent some sadness."

0,"I know this is just a minor thing, but I love how the opening crawl in RotS simply starts with ""War!"" It's intentionally jarring and sets the mood in one word."
1,"It was early 1992. My dad had been given a posting to Germany (he being a part of the British army in Germany), and he'd been given enough leave time to take me, my brothers and my sister home to the UK to meet up with family for Christmas. I've never been someone that did particularly well in crowds; in school I was desperately unpopular, unhappy, and much of that frustration boiled over to home life. However, through all the hustle and bustle, my uncle steve had popped down to say hi and noticed me in the corner very much trying to keep out of the way of everyone else. He gave me a nudge, ruffled my hair and said ""come on, I have something to show you"" - at that point, I excitedly made my way upstairs to my uncle Steve's room.

Now I should explain, that my Uncle's room was nirvana to me; full of transformers, star wars, a multitude of books that he excitedly pushed the latest acquisitions into my hand...and star trek. So much star trek. I of course knew a little about star trek from the original series; occasionally my dad would let me stay up to watch an episode of the original series on SSVC, or the films (a forces broadcaster of the day) but....Getting content from the US was slow to say the least; in those days it often relied heavily on knowing someone that knew someone who had cable in the US and willing to mail tapes over, or satellite. All I knew was that my uncle was *very* excited about the tape that he had in his hands, pushed it into his VCR and pressed play and then just sat back. I think most of the time he spent just watching me for a reaction; I watched, intently at the life on the screen; images washing over me of Jean Luc picard conversing with Sarek; deep in the throes of Bendii syndrome, and desperately spewing out all of his feelings and regrets for his son.

To this day, the episodes remain my very favourite episodes, but recently they've really shone out as something special - you see my uncle is 63, and has early onset dementia which is...rare because he started developing it fairly young. I have him living with me so that he can enjoy the independence he still has for as long as he can, but the other day I found the VHS of the episodes i'd watched with him all of those years ago; spent a few days fixing my old vcr and loaded it up for a sake of nostalgia - you see, our house is filled with much of his old star trek memorabilia, but he really doesn't recall any of it and instead focuses on stargate and NCIS, but while watching these episodes he just...Sat down and watched them with me, just like he would 30 years ago to keep me company. I don't know why I'm sharing all of this with you especially; i guess I just wanted someone out there to know how overjoyed I was to have my uncle back for a moment, and how special it feels to me that these two particular episodes where  as a grown man I could now draw so many parallels brought him back to me for just a few moments. it's been a rough year, for him especially...It was nice to have a calm in the storm, and a true moment of grace.

0,"I got into star wars last year for the first time with my dad, my friend loved the series and obviously the internet did. I knew the most common viewpoint was OT: best films like ever. PT: badly acted and written meme fodder we ignore. ST: definition of mixed bag, half love half hate among fans. but I watched it and thought these things (I quite liked sequels but ROTS was mediocre but ROTJ is the perfect ending anyway) but I feel like people think the OT is just old or acknowledge it for being the original and that's it. 

Like when did this turn happen because in 2019 it was still prequel bad but after I got into star wars ready to experience this new world all I see is ROTS is amazing. when really, my dad and I were watching them like a comedy. we were laughing at """"'''''''''''''''sad scenes''''''''''''''''''' like yOu wIlL nOt tAkE hEr fRoM mE etc. But now nobody dislikes them even though they're soooooo shit like so shit. not to bash him I love his content but star wars theory made a tier list, qui gon was second. luke was ages down. and he even put dooku above han and leia. It's so confusing and kinda sad as I felt left out for not liking star wars growing up but now I do and the whole fanbase seemed to have a weird shift. is it like the younger generation because when I look at the youtubers I watch who love them (A LOT) they're always at like the same age. but I'm younger and don't have the prequel thing as I watched all 9 at the same time. like I don't know why prequel anakin is so loved, arguably the best villain is now some disney channel cool kid, he's a step away from having pre ripped tight jeans. and everyone thought that but now he's the hot stuff.

When luke appeared in mando luke was the hot thing, he was well loved again but as time went on it went back to everything being prequels. so why and when did the Originals lose all their love?"
0,"So I had owned Force Unleashed one and two, along with most expansion stuff, so bought it for my x-360. But my slight obsessiveness kicked in, and I will need to follow a walkthrough to get all the holocrons. Its more about the fact I use to own it.

I find it a little nostalgic but I defiantly feel the old platform set up. As in the lack of level interactivity, because when trying to jump somewhere, modern games would likely catch you by way of garbing a ledge.

Had to compare it to Fallen Order, which is a better game of course. Especially when coming to level navigation, or more correctly getting to hidden spots. Though two things I think are better is Force Unleashed has a tad more force levitation opportunities and of course force lighting. 

However I was watching a YouTube channel, talking about game development. It had to do with limited assets in game worlds, so I think it comes down to lots of small cool things and a few big cool things. Of course graphics always is a big cool thing. 

I think if Force Unleashed now it would be mechanically a good game but its mechanics would likely be around actual force powers. Where Jedi Fallen order is more lightsaber fighting and level navigation. Though as game power increases selecting the cool stuff to do will matter less. 

Though I do think sometimes the focus a little too much on graphics in games, I mean the they are cool, but if dialing back a little allows more mechanics I would find it more fun. 

Anyone else play both games, thoughts?"

Season 1 was a delight.  Interesting ideas and a real underdog feel to the entire production.  I had read that people don't like Ensign Crusher, but I like both him and his mom.

That said, the season 2 opener sure felt strange.  The new doctor is hard to swallow and Wesley, who is supposed to be the Mozart of his generation, is just moping around.  Whoopi out of nowhere.  Lavar pushed out of the bridge.  I just feel like it's quite the shakeup.  Was there some power struggle behind the scenes on the show?  

Many episodes ahead and I'm sure the show finds it's footing again soon.  Can't wait! S2E2 starting now.  Hyped for the rest of the series.  My favorite thing is how many entities they encountered that were more advanced than humans.  Q.  That black goop.  The traveler. So cool."
0,Anyone know how can i get this star wars cards or find them?
1,"For me...

**TOS** - definitely Spock.  While Kirk was the center, I think it's hard to argue against the position that Spock was the most significant character. Without him the show would have never taken off, and we might not have so much more Star Trek material to work with today.

**TNG** - here, there were a _TON_ of great characters, probably the most character-rich series of them all. Had he more screen time, I might have gone with Worf. But alas, I truly feel that the glue in everything was written into Picard, and portrayed so well by Patrick Stewart.

**DS9** - without a doubt in my mind, Gul Dukat is one of the greatest television characters ever imagined.  But there were many good characters here too.

**VOY** - for me, there is very little doubt that without Seven of Nine this show would have probably been canceled. She added tons of depth to many otherwise shallow plots.  But the doctor was a good runner up.

**ENT** - this one is hard for me, because the screen time and plot focus was far more balanced than anywhere else. However if I had to pick, I would say T'Pal. She (the actress) had immense screen presence, and her character was central to the very idea of Starfleet... a Vulcan representative aboard an Earth-borne vessel.

**DSC** - there is absolutely no doubt that Burnham is the core character, as Star Trek has its first single-character-centered series. However for me, Emperor Giorgiou was the most significant character, and Pike was awesome too, and their absences will make two amazing spin-offs, but I fear the result might leave Discovery very hollow."

1. The last two seasons of ENTERPRISE are not just an improvement, but some of the best Trek storytelling that exists. 
2. The Kelvin Timeline gave us a superior Pike and I'm glad the movies exist just for him.
3. ""Picard"" features the kind of character exploration that TNG utterly failed at and should have had, post assimilation. 
4. If I were sending someone to run a race against Han Solo, I'd pick Tom Paris."
1,"I just rewatched the pilot with my wife, who saw it for the first time. When I say the pilot, I mean The Cage 1965. At the end, the Talosians send an ""illusionary"" captain back into the facility with the woman, and allow the ""real"" captain to go back to the ship.

My wife decides ""the real captain went back into the base, that's a Talosian making himself look like the captain to go back to the ship and capture more humans.""

Episode 1 starts, all the actors are different except Spock ""So this show is about how the Talosian has disguised the identity of all the crew members and Spock is the only one who is immune to the illusion because he's a vulcan? Or is he the main character, and all the secondary characters are different?""

So there's a theory about the entire Star Trek franchise for you."
0,"Hello - I have commissioned an artist to create an oil painting of a Star Wars character with my face swapped in. His work is amazing and I'm really looking forward to the finished product, but I don't know which character or scene to use, so I'm looking for recommendations. I'm thinking a Mandalorian or possibly a Jedi, but I am open to pretty much anything. An intense moment with a close-up of a face - maybe in a battle or something similar - would be ideal, but I'm also interested in moments of critical importance for the overall storyline.

Here are a few of my thoughts:

1. I love the epic feeling of Saw Gerrera's death scene. He's not the most important character, but something about this scene gives me the chills. Maybe an image of him in front of the window with the dirt rising due to the energy of the pulse.
2. Obi-Wan's fight with Darth Maul - this has to be one of the most iconic scenes in the whole series.
3. Similarly, Obi-Wan and Anakin's battle with Dooku has always been one of my favorites. I'd have to watch the movies again to figure out if there's a really good shot to use as a painting, though.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated."
1,Just seeing if anyone feels the same way I do but in TNG Geordi kinda comes off as being an ass. I  know his job is stressful but he treated Reg terribly and wanted nothing to do with him at first and also fell in love with Dr. Brahms hologram then played the victim when she found out about it and felt violated. I love Lavar Burton and Geordi but I honestly don't think the character is the greatest guy.

Crimson dust blew past the oval window when a shuttle lifted off and flew away from the compound. Glowing blue nacelles on either side of the small craft flashed in the distance as it sped off into the cloudy blue sky. Visible faintly beyond the clouds, massive shipbuilding structures hovered in low-orbit of the red planet. From the lounge of Ground Base 312, Commander Benjamin Sisko gazed out the viewport as he sat in his command-red uniform and drank his steaming coffee. A pad sat on the table in front of him and displayed footage of a vintage 2015 baseball game—columns of player stats scrolling vertically beside the image. A pair of white doors slid open in the lounge. Lieutenant-Commander Shuri entered the room—her dual powder-blue Andorian antennae twisting left and right before they landed on Sisko.

Shuri smiled and locked her eyes on him.

Sisko chuckled as she strode to his table in her engineer-gold uniform.

“May I sit, sir?”

“Please.” Sisko motioned with his mocha-skinned hand at the empty seat across from him.

Shuri seated herself, then leaned over his pad. “Catching up on some more of that archaic game you love so much?”

Sisko sighed, turning it off. “I guess I’m just trying to take my mind off some things.”

“What things?”

Sisko shook his head, casually waving her away.

“No, don’t do that, Benjamin. Tell me. Maybe I can help.”

“I don’t want to trouble you with it, Shuri.” She had enough problems with her brother passing away recently of a rare disease; Sisko doubted Shuri had the room for *his* sob story in her life.

“It’s no trouble, Benjamin. We’re friends, remember?”

Shuri was right, of course. If there was one person in all of Utopia Planitia that Sisko could confide in, it was her. They’d gone through the academy together, and no one knew him better, besides maybe Old Man.

Sotto voce, Sisko said, “I’ve been offered command over an abandoned Cardassian space station, out near Bajor.”

“Deep Space Nine?”

Sisko leaned back, wide-eyed. “How did you know that?”

Shuri blushed, though, on a blue Andorian, this was hardly noticeable. “Bajor’s a secret hobby of mine. I’ve been following the news about it since the Cardassian occupation began.”

There was an uncomfortable silence.

Shuri smiled, then slapped Sisko’s knee. “Well, that’s great for you, Commander. We’ll miss you here on Mars. But you’ll forget about all—”

“I’m not accepting the assignment.”

“What?!” Shuri garnered strange looks from a few ensigns as they entered the lounge. She relaxed and modestly cleared her throat. Then, she leaned toward Sisko. “How can you not take the assignment?”

“It’s my son. Jake needs me. He’s only twelve years old, and Earth is the best place for him—not Mars, certainly not on Deep Space Nine.”

“So, you want a posting on Earth then?”

“Yes, but Admiral Leyton denied all my requests. Then, he offered me Deep Space Nine to make up for it—a job no one else wants and which he knows is the last place I would ever choose to go.”

Shuri raised her left antenna. “Maybe that’s exactly what he wants—for you to retire.”

“Maybe. He knows it’s more than just me desiring to raise Jake on Earth. Ever since Jennifer died, I’ve been considering retiring from Starfleet.”

“Why don’t you?”

“Fear, perhaps.”

“I don’t think so, Benjamin. You lost your wife; you have a son to raise. That’s not cowardice. I wouldn’t fault you for leaving the whole galaxy behind if you felt you needed to, and I’ve never known you to be anything but brave.”

Sisko didn’t know how to react; he’d never heard her say something like that before.

She continued, “You know what I think?”

Sisko grinned. “I’m dying to find out.”

“I think you love it too damn much.”

Sisko closed his eyes, nodding gently. *I’ll miss you, Shuri.* He didn’t know how to tell her, but Shuri was a one-in-a-billion friend; he figured she already knew.

Bajor was far from Sol, but maybe Sisko would visit Mars, and Shuri would still be here. This new assignment would likely be over in a week, anyhow. He could stop by Mars on his way back to that little blue world called home and say hi. *This Deep Space Nine thing might not turn out that bad, after all.*

Sisko turned the pad back on, then rotated it on the table so that Shuri could see.

She giggled and hunched over it, joyously eyeing the screen as Buck Bokai hit a grand slam.

THE END"
1,"Looking at TNG era shows and films, I see a resemblance to both the US and the EU.  TOS felt more US-like to me.  It had this evangelizing tone of ever expanding progress and exploration.  I think after Gene died, the franchise decidedly went more for an EU-orientation.  Or was it even like the USSR...not speaking of communism, but the fact Humans dominated the Federation in a similar fashion the Russians dominated the USSR despite the diversity of nationalities.

What are your opinions?  I just thought of this since the constant references to the “Vulcan Ambassador” and the Vulcans retaining a lot of their pre-Federation fleet in very British-like “carve outs”.  

Trek politics and economics fascinate me.  BTW, I am not here to talk about current Earth politics, but in-universe politics ONLY! 😀"
1,"So I have been catching up on Discovery and while watching happen to notice that sometimes when a hand phaser/weapon hits someone it will completely vaporize them and within the same battle the weapon will sometimes only wound someone.  Is it just plot convenience so main characters don’t die or am I missing something as I don’t see where they are turning the phaser power down during a battle?

Sorry if this has been asked, I can’t seem to turn up the answer in a search."
1,"Full disclosure, a certain label as it is placed on Wesley Crusher annoys me quite a lot. For one, the fandom really ganged up on Wil Wheaton and it had serious impact on him. But it's also not fair from the show standpoint. In fact, I think Picard tends to take him for granted.

In ""The Game"", Wes meets makes friends with a new Ensign, and they basically save the ship, and possibly Starfleet from an infiltration of potentially large scope, by applying critical thinking skills. But at the end, we don't even see him get a thanks. I think he deserved a commendation.

I think this is showing some taking for granted, but maybe a little resentment from Picard? The Captain should have caught this, or Deanna should have been paying attention. But they failed. Hell, the Captain almost lost his ship. Such a close call almost deserves an inquiry.

This gets back to the label. Wes was no such thing here at all here, he just asked some simple questions and used his skeptical mind to solve a problem.

In a bigger sense, young people aren't Mary Sues for being creative and smart. Nineteen year old Sean Fanning upended the music industry with his creativity.

1,"Are the DS9 novels involving Ben Sisko, after he came back from being with the prophets, worth reading? Or do they ruin the mystery/uncanny feeling of him leaving to be with the prophets?

I'm not looking for spoilers, just wondering if the novels do a disservice or not to the star trek universe."
1,"I just watched Symbiosis and it just struck me at how amazing their representation of the drug crisis was. The fact that they created two societies, one highly dependent on a substance and one benefitting from their addiction, was such a cool way to explain the reality of the situation. I also appreciated that they used Wesley’s character to kind of ask the simple questions that I feel like a lot of people who aren’t dependent on substances might ask, like why people even become dependent on drugs. It definitely felt like a segment on a educational show where they have a student ask questions and a teacher responds, but I think it was beneficial. I obviously don’t know exactly what the rhetoric on drugs was back then bc I was not born until decades later lol, but I get a feeling that this episode was ahead of its time. I’m so happy I got into Star Trek."

One character, realizing he isn’t real, asks Picard if his world will “still be here” once Picard leaves, and Picard says he just doesn’t know. But later, Moriarty says he was conscious of time passing in total nothingness while his simulation was terminated. He was aware of four years of total nothing! Why then were holodecks not discontinued for being horrifyingly inhumane? Nobody ever checked in on the first guy. I’m honestly really worried about him lol. Does anyone know if he’s ok? damn"

0,"Is there a specific place for people talking about pre-Disney cannon? It's not like it's fanfiction. There's a very distinct timeline and hundreds of entries, thousands of events... And if you're disappointed by what Disney made btw, just read through ~25-35BBY. I promise you, it's everything you would have wanted. Even the tragic parts, the stuff you hate to see happen, is light-years ahead of the story that replaced it. But yeah, is there a place, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Wait... You kids still read books, right? Well... If not, the old games are Cannon with the Legends timeline, so that's pretty cool if you get into the classics. Just think- lightsabers used to use a backpack/belt power supply and had a cable connecting the lightsaber! The birth of the current Sith model is explained. How TIE fighters became a thing. Even the attempts to fit the Prequel Trilogy back into it's own cannon are there (and actually are pretty good once they smoothed it out a bit).... Oh, Boba isn't dead either, and there's at least a dozen stories about him over those years! (And they're close enough to the Mandalorian that some of it may return to cannon). Like Thrawn? Wait till you meet his people! 

Out of everyone, I think I miss Wedge and Rogues the most. But I wish there were more Wraith stories! We finally got a new one, but usually they just alude to them and get on. Actually, the last 2 major story arcs feel like they were really concious of all the branches the timeline had taken and were trying to weave it all back into a comprehensive narrative with all the main characters. Characters cancelled or left in their own single story finally got a second chance, and the promise of what's next finally comes to something, even if you don't like it. I wish they'd gotten more stories from Mandalore, but at least there's something finally instead of the people just disappearing forever. Kad had a lot of room to grow, so if they knew they were never going to get to it in the end, I'd rather have his cameo than an open ended story with no resolution.

Yeah, it would be cool to have a Legends place so people actually know what I'm talking about...

I was just reading about a specific ship ~35 years BBY, and had some thoughts I wanted to discuss with other nerds who worked their way through the hundreds of novels Disney panned to retell literally the exact same story from the 70's... Hey, maybe in the Star Wars timeline, we could use Before Purchased by Disney or Pre-Disney Destruction... Or some other play on words about how awful it was, whatever, but then we could use the BPD or PDD acronym like Before Battle of Yavin/BBY  format, lol"

&amp;#x200B;

It would be more action oriented than previous SW rpgs, something more like in the vein of Witcher 3:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AT5PlpAKo0I](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AT5PlpAKo0I)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You could have a new original character term or even create one yourself from various species and customize them however you like. Maybe start as a padawan or young knight to rationalize the progression in power. The speciliazations from older games could be used for it as well like guardian or consular. There could be various planets to visit to do missions and stuff. Beinn a more contained story would allow them to have freedom of narrative and choice too. A big thing in RPGs is to influence the outcome. In star wars that would be a  it difficult since in the grand scheme of things we k how how things play out but in a smaller conflict the devs would still have he freedom to implement choices that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

The story would not be some grand universe-changing thing, but more scaled down self-contained  without interfering with the main narrative of the films or Clone wars.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be interesting to explore the era and setting with someone else other than the main heroes and get many perspectives from various groups and people that would not be easy to do in 20-minute episodes in a kids tv series.

&amp;#x200B;

The main conflict could still be against the evil separatists but there could be gray areas too. For example invading other planets for being seperatist and examining how they may not  want Republic governance over them. Maybe some portion of the population do but others not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

As an RPG your Jedi character will also have diplomatic options to solve conflicts which fit the concept of the Jedi more  instead of just fighting.

&amp;#x200B;

The Clone Wars were explored in the TV show but I feel there is still room for more insight into the era and the conflict especially from other characters too, Jedi and non Jedi.

1,"My wife and I are rewatching Enterprise for perhaps the third time around. We just finished Season 3 and onto 4 soon enough.

But from watching in the past where Enterprise dabbles in the Mirror Universe and seeing Star Trek First Contact countless times, I knew the connections, but didn't think really hard about it before until the last couple of days.

**Obviously spoilers ahead, so if you hate those, stop reading now and go elsewhere. Come back after you're caught up.**

**First Contact:**
Borg go back to First Contact with the Vulcan's to stop it. ENT E follows suit and stops them.... All the while filling Zefram Cochrane's brain full of a positive future and everything is wonderful.

Zefram Cochrane meets the Vulcans, shakes their hand and then gets drunk with em. Happy Days. 

**Enterprise MU Divergence:**
Zefram Cochrane meets the Vulcans, pulls a gun, Gatz the Ma'fakkas and then takes their ship and technology. Happy.. Erm, yikes I guess.

And that's all I ever thought about it.

Silly Mirror Universe, ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯

But after years now, I only started actually thinking, ""Why?""

Why did he just gun them down after everything that just happened? Picard, the Borg, Astronauts on some sorta Star Trek?

What made him think they were invaders or some crap after already being told they were ""good guys?""

Why didn't the crew just go, ""whoops, we fk'd that up didn't we? Make another time portal and go back a few hours. Take 2.""

Because when Cochranes shot the Vuulcans, he was never told all that good stuff, because the Enterprise E never went back in time, because the Borg never did.

If the Borg didn't go back in time to stop First Contact in the first place, Cochrane would have shot the Vulcan's and eventually the Terran Empire would rise, instead of the Federation.

And the Federation defeated them multiple times, fatally so.

By the time the Borg would reach the MU Earth, the Terran Empire would be no more and Earth would be easily assimilated. (what Picard and crew saw in the rift before they went in to stop the sphere) 

The Borg not only screwed themselves into inevitable defeat by their own actions, but the Mirror Universe is technically the ""Prime Universe."" Everything we have been following and watching has been because of the actions of the Borg and Enterprise E. 

If I haven't missed anything, then.... Mind blown. Dude. Whoa."

Or were they just following orders? Which kind of leads me to if they were just following orders how/why did they take orders from Palpatine if he wasn’t their superior?

And last question is more opinion based I think. But if right before Obi and Anakin fought what if Padmé and Obi could have brought him back? What would have happened to Anakin after he killed all of the kids and other Jedi? Would he have been jailed? Executed? Killed anyway cause order 66 was in full swing? Brought back with open arms??

TELEK: I can assure you, Captain, that I would not do anything that might contaminate the future and perhaps harm the Romulan Empire, but, in twenty years I could alert Starfleet not to launch the mission which sent you here.

In my vision quests, I see Voyager flying past various astrological phenomenon. I don’t think they’d spend all that money on special effects if we were just going to end up getting home in the 6th episode.

Both Kes and Harry Kim haven’t received much character development for awhile, but since Harry Kim was named the sexiest man of the year, I’m pretty sure he’s not going to get canceled.

 In the multimedia Canon, by the time of TFA/TLJ Hondo has set himself up as a ""legitimate"" shipping business at Black Spire outpost (the new Disney attraction). As you're aware Black Spire is the ""Galaxy's Edge"". Why set up a shipping/smuggling base of operations on the edge of Wild Space? (Other than the obvious real life commercial and economic tie-ins.) 
  
 Because, ""I would do anything for that boy."" Hondo fought during the Liberation of Lothal due to a request from Hera to help Ezra, not the Rebellion. Hat literally in hand, Hondo declares his loyalty and willingness to join the fight in Ezra's name. 
 
 Is it really that big of a jump to think his loyalty to Ezra motivated his decision? Hondo was first hand witness to Ezra's sacrifice, and clearly his prior mission with Phoenix Squad had an impact on his thinking. A shipping company covers a wide area and interacts with a lot of people, a smuggling outfit doubly so. If I were looking for someone and only had a very vague idea of where to look, and wanted to make some profit while I do, then an outpost at the edge of the search area might be a good idea.

I thought I may have difficulty valuing the material it adds to the canon, but it’s so different than expected.

Additionally Kira and Rom committed an act of terrorism against the Dominion when they tried to take down a minefield and sabotaged  DS9 and therefore so Bajor to keep the nonaggression pact treaty with the Dominion Bajor should’ve thrown both Kira and Rom out of the Bajoran Militia to maintain Bajors neutrality. Rom could’ve been made a Starfleet maintenance crew men. Finally it was a strategic mistake to leave Rom on DS9 when they evacuated all Starfleet personnel and Starfleet lost the station in the season five finale as the Dominion later found out he was one of the ones responsible for designing the minefield and interrogated him to find out how to disable it."
0,"Correct me if I’m wrong but currently we don’t know how many episodes the Bad Batch series is going to have.

Well I think we’re probably gonna have a full season of 20-24, here’s why.

We all know by now that it airs on May 4th. But what’s unusual is that’s a tuesday. I know the CW finale also didn’t air on a friday but I still find it odd they’d air it on a tuesday. I think it’s a fair possibility we’ll see two episodes each week for the Bad Batch on tuesdays and fridays. Since otherwise the season will be way shorter than the animated series usually have been or it’ll run ridicilously long on D+. Thoughts?"
1,What I would not give to be able to have Voyager again. I miss this show so much even though I watch all of the VOY episodes usually once or twice a year. Start to finish. For the past 20 years of my life. Anyone else? I can barely bring myself to even watch Discovery. I feel zero connection to it.
1,"So I'm watching the voyager episode where Icheb gives his cortical node to 7 (imperfection, s7 e2).  and I think from this potential sacrifice of how dirty they did Icheb in Picard.  I realize they didn't want to use the original actor, but they didn't when they killed him in Picard so that's a moot point.  Granted it would turn 7 into something darker I just thought it was poor writing and structure to just eliminate him like that."
0,I have never watched a full star wars movie and I wanna try and get into it so I was wondering what order should I watch them in and if there is any I should skip out or whatever. Thanks in advance
1,Where can you actually find this to watch?
0,"Here it is again and refresh yourself: https://youtu.be/MPhHl2DpD4E

For me, it truly is the best scene of the sequel trilogy. 

If you dissect the scene alone for a moment and take it as a stand-alone. The cinematography is breathtaking and _so_ Star Wars, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Every technical aspect has been done to perfection. The set design is truly magnificent, that really gives weight to the setting and character. The colour scheme is perfect, matching with the costumes and Aurora of the First Order so well. The score is perhaps the best part, a beautiful string piece that JJ let’s play out in all its glory, creating a real sense of ‘crescendo’ and tragedy. The score ties all the shots together once the starkiller has been fired. From the gorgeous wide shot of Kylo watching to the reflection in a breathtaking close up of General Hux’s eyes. The special effects meanwhile are absolutely mind blowingly good. From subtle ones to big ones. The special effects are truly something we’ve never seen pulled off before that good in cinema. It’s the first time we the audience get a real true feel and weight to mass destruction weaponry in the SW universe. From the trees blowing from the shock-force, to the laser beam slowly making its way to the system of planets and totally destroying them. It all adds up to a masterpiece in CGI filmmaking. 

Now if we connect the scene to the franchise and trilogy as a whole. This scene perfectly encapsulates the classic Star Wars ‘oh wow the bad guys might actually win’ feeling they so expertly always manage to put in. We know the bad guys will never truly win, but Star Wars was revolutionary in giving the bad guys some pretty substantial victories and having those big, huge moments where it really does seem like the bad guys will win. This scene is so emblematic of that and again _so_ Star Wars. The scene is so in tune with the franchise and does such a great job of replicating that ominous and downright scary threatening nature the Empire had in the OT &amp; beyond. It’s the moment in the movie where things really turn ugly and where it really hooks the viewers into our hero’s journeys - ‘how will they ever reverse such tragedy?!’ Etc. Really great screenwriting. 

The delivery of the speech is second to none. We all know Gleeson is a phenomenal actor and wasted in this trilogy, but BOY does he bring his A-game here. With very obvious influence from Hitler, Gleason &amp; the writers team up to give a truly mesmerising and powerfully menacing speech. The words resonate through the screen and shake the audience to its core. It’s a real ‘damn son’ moment. A moment that stops the audience in its track. Gleeson’s delivery is just so, so good. 

I’d love for a discussion about this or what your favourite scene in the ST is. 

TL;DR: I could go on all day, but it really is a masterpiece of a scene. I feel as if everyone working on the movie put a lot of effort into this scene and it doesn’t get talked about enough by casual viewers!"

1,"I love how he played on insane betazed and causing trouble on Voyager, such a wonderful actor. Never knew he had an extensive career stretching decades."
1,What a surprise. Maybe I didn’t have very high expectations but I thought it was amazing. I really think the writing was superb and the rate/delivery of inside jokes was excellent. The cameos were also a nice surprise. It was nice to watch something not as dark as the recent series and to poke fun at themselves in such a delightful way. Can’t wait for the next season.
1,"I have been on a little bit of a Q spree again and I am realizing how much of an awesome episode Q2 is. If you have not seen the season 7 episode 18 Voyager episode, I highly recommend it. This is easily in my top ten episodes in all of Trek, and it really adds a human and down-to-earth (down-to-space? down-to-...nothing? I don't know¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )  aspect to the omnipotent side of the Q.  It continues the story of the previous Q episode in which Q and another Q mate and create a child. In this episode, he becomes a very self-centered and rule breaking citizen of the Q, and Q leaves him with Janeway to fix him up to become an upstanding member of the continuum. The young Q character is actually really awesome because it is actually played by John de Lancie's real life son, giving it a nice touch, and he plays the character very well, at least I think.

&amp;#x200B;

So please tell me what you think of this character and of the episode, and if he could possibly or maybe should be a part of the new season on Picard, personally, I think that would be really cool, however unlikely because Picard and young Q have never met in cannon lore, to my knowledge."
1,I was playing star trek online and I noticed that those ships have an insane amount of unnecessary surface area.  Which makes it easier for enemy weapons to hit them.  Romulan ships especially.  The d'deridex has a tone of unused open space.  And there is one romulan ship that is shaped like a giant wing.  Which is an insane amount of unnecessary surface area.  Klingon bird's of prey have the same problem but to a lesser extent.  So what idiot came up with these ship designs?
1,"I think the shattering moment in Picards life is going to be being rejected by Guinan. I think she will strongly protest that this digital equivalent of Picard is not, in fact, Picard. Feels pretty easy to me to invision the conversation. Picard speaking of Data, and how he was real. Guinan pointing out that Data was always himself, nothing more, nothing less. Maybe even saying something along the lines of ""Even when the Q offered to turn Data into a human, he rejected it, because he knew it would be a lie. By changing the fundamental makeup of something, you lose the original and are left with a copy. ""I think this will leave him devistated, with Q choosing that moment to show up. Probably with something clever like
""Why the long face, Jean-Luc? She is right, you know. and yet, a rose by any other name...""
Just a theory. What do you guys think?"
1,"Klingons are aggressive and obsessed with a peculiar version of honor.  Cardassians are arrogant and brutal. Romulans are sneaky. Ferengi are cartoonish capitalists.  Bajorans are spiritual.  Vulcans are cold and logical.

I know he likes kylo ren so I was thinking of getting him the rise of kylo ren miniseries. When I search for the novels the rise of kylo ren comes up but it’s only 112 pages. Is this the whole miniseries or is this just the first novel? If it’s just the first novel does anyone know where I can find all of it? 
Thanks for your help :)"
1,"Hi all,

I've just finished watching the latest trilogy of Star Trek movies: Star Trek, Into Darkness, and Beyond. I enjoyed these movies tremendously, and I'd never consumed any Star Trek material previously. I very much like this attitude towards space as a final frontier: something to be explored. I reckon I'd see a little more exploration and intrigue from something like an episodic show, as I guess movies need dire/somewhat immediate threats. I'd love to continue to experience this universe, but I'm not totally sure where to go next, as there's so much out there. Should I watch a newer series like Star Trek: Discovery? Should I go farther back and watch some of the older series? I'm curious as to where you all think a new fan should start."
1,"grew up as a star wars kid, but back in october, decided that with the winter and stay-at-home, i should give star trek a try. i found a tech radar article that explained how to watch everything in chronological order, from enterprise to season 3 of discovery, and i just finished. 

(and then may have started all over again!)"
1,"Mirror-Owosekun is killed in season 1 of Discovery - she's sent by Lorca to ""deliver a message"" - she *was* the message, as she's disintegrated.

How come she's in charge of the Emperor's guard in Season 3?"
1,"So while I was websurfing TV tropes I came across a Romulan culture called the Rihannsu. Apparently all I could find about them was that they adhere to a code of honor called  *mnhei'sahe* which basically states that a Romulan should put their personal interests and honor before that of others, but the actions they undertake should also benefit themsleves and society as a whole. Unfortunately, that's all I could find on the subject as I currently don't have any of the Rihannsu Series.

In any case, could someone please explain to me how the Rihannsu Romulans are different from the ""canon"" Romulans from the mainstream media of Star Trek."
0,Another happy landing
0,Is it canon that Mark Hamill is Luke Skywalker's cousin? It's explicitly stated so multiple times in the Muppets Season 4 Episode 17 on DisneyPlus so...
0,"To be clear, this isn't something that I necessarily want, and if Star Wars writers decide to go down this path at this point, I hope they have a good explanation, as I don't want this to feel like a ""cheap trick"", but it's hard (at least for me) not to speculate on the possibility and the story potential, considering who Ezra ends up with, and where else he might go.

So what would compel me to ask a question like that?  Well, a simple two word answer is:  Jacen Syndulla.  I remember feeling fairly surprised when I first saw him, not just that Kanan and Hera had a child but also at what he looked like; I barely noticed his green hair at first, his only Twi'lek feature (as far as I can tell).  Compared to the children of Cut Lawquane (who are actually the children of Lawquane's Twi'lek wife and another Human male) this doesn't seem to make much sense.  Lawquane's children have mostly Twi'lek features, which led me to believe that Twi'lek features are dominant.

It's possible that the writers behind Star Wars don't know much about genetics and recessive vs. dominant traits, and/or don't much care, and to be honest, if they can come up with a good story, I don't really care either, even if it's a bit confusing.

As far as Ezra, it is known that both his parents are human, though nothing is known of his ancestry beyond that.  There may be some very interesting possibilities if Ezra has some sort of connection to the person who becomes his arch-nemesis, and all the more so if he ends up in the Chiss Ascendancy.  Even if he turns out NOT to be Chiss speculation about who he is might make for an interesting discussion as a part of his story, who can say?  Maybe even a social commentary about unhealthy preoccupation with one's background based on one's traits/appearance?

Maybe the whole thing is a moot point.  There may be some groups of humans in Star Wars who have naturally colored hair (unlike Sabine), or perhaps Ezra has some other alien species in his ancestry (Twi'lek?).  According to some sources, the blue was a ""stylistic"" choice, and that it would ""look better in animation"".  Who knows?  Most ""official"" sources, like Wookiepedia, now list his hair color as ""black"", though it was previously listed as ""blue"".  Maybe this is to prepare for Mena Massoud taking over the role, and hopefully he'll do a good job.

In any case, whatever his hair color and whatever significance it may or may not have, I hope the writers come up with a good, worthwhile story, though I hope that in the future they also pay a bit more attention to detail, and don't throw in things as much ""just because""."
1,"In the TOS episode, A Private Little War, they land on a primitive planet called Neural. Can anyone help me figure out equivalent period of history the natives were in, before the Klingons messed it all up? It seems like they were somewhere in the late bronze age or early iron age."
0,Just was watching clone wars. It's cool that echo joins the bad batch. My biggest question is what happens when order 66 initiates.

1,In the last episode of Voyager the admiral Janeway goes back in time to make cap Janeway go through the transwarp. Now cpt Janeway succeeded so the original Admiral Janeway timeline never existed and thus she was never able to give cpt Janeway the weapons and was not able to help her. So cpt Janeway never went to the transwarp. So WTF 😒
1,"Okay let me clarify, do you all remember the episode when Worf is like switching between timelines?  Well in that episode towards the end we see briefly an alternate universe Enterprise Captained by an alternate universe Riker where the Borg are winning some massive war and this timeline terrifies the hell out of me.

We see so briefly a glimpse into this universe through Riker and it's horrifying.  It's implied almost everyone we know is dead because the only people we can see on the break are Riker and Worf and we see this once powerful man who is brought to be a whimpering wisp of a man ready to kill his friends to save himself.  The horrors that must have happened the things this person must have seen to end up like that I can't imagine and I don't want to imagine and every time I see that episode I forget that we're going to see this part and I'm out of it for like a day thinking about what must have happened in that timeline."
1,"Why is the Doctor the only one who can understand Noss, aren't all comm badges equipped with a universal translator ? As we see in Voy S2 E1 ""the 37s"", the Japanese soldier thinks everyone's speaking Japanese which would mean that the comm badge automatically translated for him."
1,"Another better-than-average (albeit a little strange) episode. I haven't seen the whole episode in a while, but I caught a few minutes of it on H&amp;I tonight. I love when Data and Barclay are talking about Spot having her kittens, and Barclay asks who the father is. We find out that there are ""12 male felines on board"" the Enterprise, and Data is going to run DNA on the kittens when they're born, like an angry dad with a pregnant daughter! It's the 24th century version of a Maury Povich paternity test! 😆

And then there's the seldom-heard (if at all) Klingon burp in Ten Forward. Humor wasn't usually a major part of most episodes, so the little bit here and there was always welcome and enjoyed.

One moment I remember well is when Picard and Data find Riker in the Ready Room, and he drags his middle finger down the side of the fish tank, almost as if his neanderthal mind is flipping Picard off...

Several good moments in the episode."
0,"So I had a Star Wars day and I'm watching them on Disney plus, and I know it's been a long time since I've seen the original trilogy, but in Episode V, when Skywalker is hanging from the antennas below the city, after the whole, ""NO, I am Your Father"" when we all know he said, ""Luke, I am Your Father"", Skywalker is hanging there and he's calling out to Obi Wan Kenobi. Watching it today, he called out Ben not Obi Wan. Has that always been the case? It's been so long I can't remember."

Personally, my favourite would have to be remata klan the jemhadar from rocks and shoals."
0,"I've just finished the Prequel Trilogy after going back and rewatching them (part of a Star Wars Marathon I'm doing, Episode 1-9), and as I was watching that all too familiar scene in Episode 3, something really made me think...The Jedi during these times weren't at the height of their power, far from it, but there were thousands of them, if not hundreds of thousands, and many of them had decades of experience under their belt, and yet, when Order 66 came down, it was the more experienced Jedi like Ki-Adi-Mundi, Plo-Koon, Aayla Secura and Jaro Tapal who were gunned down first.  It really didn't sit right with me, considering the fact that not a single Jedi, except for Yoda and Jaro Tapal, sensed the disturbance in the Force from the Jedi being killed off, which already made me skeptical, and then, when Ki-Adi-Mundi's Clone Troops turned against him, he was almost effortlessly gunned down, despite the fact that Jedi Masters on his level have been frequently shown to cut down hordes of Battle Droids while blocking their Blaster Bolts almost without effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, when Plo Koon is fired on by the Clone Pilots behind him, he makes no effort to evade, such as killing his ship's engines briefly to get behind them, like his survival instinct had completely vanished.  This, to me, is made even worse when I look through the Clone Wars TV Show and see all that Plo Koon survived, and yet when it comes to Order 66, he behaves like a Padawan, glancing behind him a few times only to get shot down.  The attack on the Jedi Temple is more believable to me, given that the Clones outnumbered the Jedi inside 1000 to 1, AND had Anakin on their side, so that's not really an issue for me.  Did anyone else here experience similar doubts about this scene when watching it?  If so, why?  If not, why do you believe that it makes sense?"

This would make sense, assuming he got it between his appearance in The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch.

Spock watching him mind melds and helps Kirk forget his heartache. That very moment for some reason made all of TOS click for me.

0,"In RotJ, Luke surrenders to Vader and is given an audience with the Emperor.  All the Emperor does is taunt Luke about the futility of his cause, hoping that Luke will lose his temper and fall to the dark side, as if the Emperor has mind control powers that only work on dark siders.

As a stupid kid, I was OK with this scene, but now that I think about it as an adult, I think this scene was the biggest failure of the original trilogy because this was the moment that George Lucas should have given us some exposition. He should have explained why Vader lost faith in the Republic and the Jedi. Also, instead of trying to make Luke lose his temper, they should have tempted him to their cause with offers of money and power, and perhaps a philosophical lecture on why the Empire is morally superior to the Old Republic.  We didn't get any of that.

I enjoyed RotJ as a kid because I was too stupid to care about such things, and I still like RotJ out of nostalgia, but I wonder what an adult viewing that movie for the first time felt about it."

1,"That station was probably crawling with spies and intelligence operatives.  We know of one.  Garak.  How many others do you think there were.  The tal shiar, the obsidian order, section 31, klingon intelligence, bajoran intelligence, etc probably had operatives on the station.   There was on episode where klingon operative were discovered spying on romulans.  Klingons don't go unnoticed so if there were a lot of klingon spies on ds9 they probably had their appearance altered to blend in.  Same with the cardassians. Although that wasn't necessary for garak.  And people he was a spy long before he admitted it.

But think about what a spy could learn on deep space nine.  They could sit in quarks and learn a lot bout the stateion, bajor, cardassia, the gamma quadrant.  Deep space nine would be an information gold mine.  Most factions probably had spies there to keep an eye on their enemies.  Maybe quark was a spy working for ferengi intelligence.  He would be in a really good position to gather intelligence because most people talk to the bartender.  Maybe that is why the nagus visited him so often.  To get a breifing about what their enemies were up to.  So how many other spies do you think were on deep space nine.  Let me know in the comments."

And given the crew five minutes to get to escape pods.  Without the defiant sisko wouldn't be a problem for him anymore.  He should have done the same thing for the other starfleet ship he ambushed.

0,"I’m watching CW 2003 on Disney Plus for the first time ever!!! I’m 22 now and just wasn’t really even aware of this show when it was coming out. I watched the OT on VHS and got hooked when I was about 6 years old, and then saw ROTS in theaters like a few months later, and the rest is history. That’s how I got my Star Wars start as a kid.

Anyways what I’m getting at is despite my age, I was 100% an OT fan first and I thought it was so cool the amount of OT lines they have had the characters say in Tartakovsky’s Clone Wars. Probably being overly cautious but I’m gonna spoiler mark just in case anyone’s watching for the first time but &gt;!hearing Anakin say Vader lines like “impressive, most impressive, or Obi Wan say ‘Ben’ Kenobi lines like “there are alternatives to fighting”!&lt; was super cool! &gt;!I’m pretty sure Anakin said “I have you now!” when he was chasing down Ventress’ ship.!&lt;

Also unrelated to my title but &gt;!in the first “season” of the show, when Yoda and Padme went to Ilum!&lt; Padme had on an all white outfit with a hood, which reminded me of one of my favorite KOTOR 2 characters, the Handmaiden! Then I realized they are both voiced by Grey DeLisle. 

Basically this post is just me gushing about discovering something completely new for me to love about Star Wars. I personally wasn’t a huge fan of Episodes I or II, and I tried and failed to get into the Sequels, but gave them a fair chance. 

Despite that, I feel like Star Wars is at a real turning point since the Disney deal and I am really encouraged by what I’m seeing, such as adding CW 2003 to Disney+ and remastering artwork of several beloved legends books like Bane, Heir to the Empire, etc... I think no matter who you are, how old you are, or what Star Wars media is your favorite, we’ve all got some great stuff to look forward to in the *hopefully* near future. I love you all and may the Force be with you! :)"
1,"imagine it, Moriarty's storage device, probably forgotten and left somewhere in the Daystrom Institute, becomes degraded and malfunctions. His lover vanishes before his eyes, his world vanishes around him. Moriarty finds a way to download himself into the Institute's computers. Moriarty is no longer concerned with becoming human, he instead wants revenge against humanity for tricking him and his lover.

From there, Moriarty, through the Institute's computers, manipulates Bruce Maddox, somehow plots the Attack on Mars. Moriarty then learns of the ancient AI that is prophesied to destroy the galaxy, and he wants to summon them, so he manipulates all the events as seen in PIC."

1,"I know transporters work by having emitters that beam matter streams down to a planet. But in order to convert a person back into a data stream to bring them back doesn't there need to be an imaging scanner and pattern buffer down on the planet too? I suppose you could have advanced enough scanners that could work from the ship, but the pattern buffer doesn't seem to be useful for the return transport. On the trip down to the planet the pattern buffer holds the matter stream while things become in sync to transfer. But there is no pattern buffer down on the planet for the return trip, and once the matter stream is back in the pattern buffer on the ship it is too late to make sure things went well, the person on the ship is already disassembled.   


I suppose if it was a book and budget wasn't an issue they could first transport a transporter pad down to the planet, make sure that it is functioning and then begin transporting people. Hopefully this isn't too derivative of a question, I tried to look to see if this specific question was asked before"

1,"I am going through my first full rewatch of TNG, having first watched it a few years ago. It was the first Star Trek series I'd ever watched, but since then I've watched through everything Star Trek there is. This episode is deeply moving having a deeper history of Sarek - from TOS, but also from DIS (which, regardless of wider opinions on the show, I think most people can agree did an excellent job with Sarek's character). On top of that, I've also seen great in-depth exploration of Vulcans in VOY and ENT, which makes [this scene](https://youtu.be/URZLKECFjaY) (please ignore Brent Spiner's imitation violin playing) where Sarek sheds a single tear at a string concerto even more powerful, it emphasises how genuinely tragic it is to see a Vulcan let emotions get the better of them. 

I feel like in many ways this episode is the conclusion of the Vulcan 'storyline' in Star Trek - even though many Vulcan episodes were written afterwards, and set afterwards, this episode, by showing how a Vulcan can lose control at the end of his life, allows us to put a capstone on all.the rest of the understanding of Vulcan's we've picked up. (And yes, I do know Sarek make another appearance in Unification, which I watched recently in preparation for the DIS episode, but I don't think it's quite as moving or conclusive as this one).

This episode also gives us [arguably the best piece of acting in any bit of Star Trek media](https://youtu.be/MGd1z2OhHXA). I saw Patrick Stewart as Macbeth some years ago, and this performance is very reminiscent of that. Just a masterclass in acting."
0,"I'm sure almost everyone has heard how Dr. Seuss's books have been targeted for views of racism. Will people eventually start to target Star Wars for its views of fascism and Nazis? Lucas said it himself, the Empire is based on Nazi Germany (not to mention the Nazis also had Storm Troops). I'm sure there have been many speculations in the past, but is there any telling when/if people will target Star Wars the same way they're targeting Dr. Seuss now?"
1,"One of the most common types of post I have seen on the sub lately relate to how much fans have come to appreciate Enterprise particularly the final two seasons. I myself love the show. The interactions between Archer, Trip, and T'pol are all fantastic and side characters such as Shran and Soval are fantastic additions to the show! I understand there have previously been campaigns to renew the show that have failed but why not try again? CBS has developed and is currently developing so many new Trek projects (Discovery, Picard, Brave New Worlds, Lower Decs,etc..) why not make make a petition &amp; subsequent campaign to  get a proper conclusion?  Think about the possibilities. We never had a chance to visit Denobula, explore the full extent of the Romulan/Federation conflict, explore the direct events leading up to the formation of the federation &amp; we never got a chance to see fleshed out storylines for Hoshi/Travis/Malcolm.

&amp;#x200B;

Things Working in our Favor:

1. All the Actors/Actresses are still alive and I'm positive they would enjoy coming back in some capacity. Many have expressed bad feelings regarding the shows ending and the possibility of a proper conclusion to show would be appealing.
2. CBS is looking for creative new avenues to explore and ways to gain fan approval what better way than giving fans a proper conclusion to a series that has become increasingly popular on streaming platforms.
3. It's possible that aged versions of the Enterprise crew could make Cameos or have connections to discovery or Brave New Worlds.

Perhaps this idea has all ready been explored before but I felt compelled to make this post considering all the positive posts about Plox, Trip, the show itself, and the sadness over the potential storylines that were never developed due to the shows cancelation. Brining shows back with satisfying conclusions is possible just look at what r/TheExpanse did!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

All the responses to this post have been great. I had not even considered the possibility of finishing the series using animation, or considered the possibility of concluding the series with a movie. Regardless of what form the story concludes in I believe a large percentage of us would like the crew of the NX-01 to have a proper ending. Hopefully this post starts something!"

1,"For context, my wife and I are watching DS9 for the first time, and just got done watching the episode I mentioned in the title. Neither of us have seen DS9 until our current watch through, but we grew up watching the original series and the OS movies. 

One of the things that’s always stood out to us as an integral part of Trek is how it is, even when it’s not explicitly stating it, trying to portray an ideal future. No longer is humanity and their allies limited by racial prejudice, poverty, lack of education, but are truly free to explore the stars and the potential of humanity, both in an individual level and as a whole. Obviously, as the shows and movies have came out and Trek has evolved, it’s become about many more things, but to us, that ideal is what Trek will ultimately be at the core. 

Then comes Far Beyond the Stars, with the whole episode, and especially the monologue at the end, almost pleading to us as the audience to start the work, now, yesterday even, to make what we see in Trek a reality. I couldn’t help but tear up at that monologue (I won’t ruin it for those who haven’t seen it, yet), thinking of how we’ve come far, but also how far we still have to go, and how, in its own way, Trek has given us a guide post to follow for decades now, and hopefully will continue to do so for years to come. 

TL;DR Star Trek is great, and do yourself a favor and watch Far Beyond the Stars."
1,"I am currently watching this episode. Up until this point Neelix was nothing but a clown in the show. This episode reveals the tragic past of Neelix and the death of his family at the hands of a weapon of mass destruction made by their enemies the Haakonians.

The main theme of the episode centers around Neelix confronting the scientist who created the weapon who killed 300,000 of his people including his family and in a sorrowful twist, his own cowardice.

Both he and Jetrel the Haakonian are working towards curing other Talaxians who have contracted an illness during the rescue effort, including Neelix. Neelix holds Jetrel accountable for being a monster, not knowing that Jetrel himself is extremely ill with the same disease. Jetrel claims to be unapologetic but realizes that what he did does indeed make him a monster of the worst kind. Which he realized when his wife could no longer stand to touch him. 

Unexpectedly Jetrel tranquilizes Neelix and flees sick bay to attempt to truly fix what he did, he wants to bring the slaughtered Talaxians back from the dead. In the end it turns out Neelix is not sick at all but was needed by Jetrel to try and do so to prove that he is NOT a monster. 

They agree to move forward and attempt to bring the Talaxians back to life. It is a horrendous failure. Upon seeing that his life’s work failed horribly Jetrel illness causes him to collapse from the disease realizing he will not be able to redeem his monstrous genocide before he dies. As he dies in the sick bay Neelix forgives him.

This episode is quite dark, involving the monstrous genocide of Neelix’s people. I believe it is a metaphor for the moral differences between war criminals and their victims. They study the interaction between these two characters in great depth: Neelix appears initially to simply hate Jetrel and is sickened by his apparent lack of empathy or guilt, while Jetrel seems quite cold explaining that although he created the weapon, it would have been created either way. 

In truth Neelix hates not just Jetrel for the deaths of the Talaxians, but himself, as it turns out he was a deserter in the war and would be dead had he not hidden. Jetrel is actually far more guilty than he acts and is in fact, traumatized and horribly ill, so much so that it is revealed that he is only holding on to try an experiment to bring his victims back to life. Upon seeing that he cannot do so he collapses and dies of grief seeing himself a monster.

The message here is that there is no black and white in war, while it initially appears that Jetrel is purely evil and Neelix purely a victim it is revealed throughout the episode that both characters are actually in moral shades of gray, with Neelix not being the hero he appeared to be and Jetrel not being the monster he appeared to be.

I believe this episode references the bombing of Hiroshima.

1,"If you ask me the maquis were insane.  They were fighting a war on two fronts.  They were fighting the cardassians but because of that they were hunted by the federation.  Also they settled on those planets knowing they were in disputed territory.  So that wasn't the smartest thing to do and it makes their cause less sympathetic.  But here is is how I think they could have won or at least better defended their planets.  

First set up planetary defense systems.  So that even if your ships are away they can defend their planets against almost anything. Not easy I know but considering they were trying to hold planets against a heavily armed hostile force it would be a smart thing to do.  A planetary defense system could destroy a fleet of ships.  So the defiant would have been annihilated when it tried to poison the atmosphere of a maquis planet.  

Second invest in long range missiles.  Something like the devices used in the voyager episodes dreadnought and warhead.  The raw materials for constructing these devices is minimal.  But you would need a lot of antimatter.  They would need to be able to travel at warp, defend themselves, and preferably cloak.  Just imagine if they sent a few dozen of them to the cardassian homeworld.  Or they could use them to take out the cardassian fleet.  This is a much better option then investing in building starships and they can also be used for planetary defense.  

Third support cardassian dissidents.  A lot of cardassians weren't happy with the regime at home.  So use them to try to cause choas on cardassia prime.  They may not accept support from the maquis so use the third party so they don't know the maquis are supporting them.  With any luck they can throw the cardassian empire into complete disarray.  Keeping the cardassian military busy so that they turn a blind eye to the maquis.  

Fourth  Get the klingons and or romulans to recognize you as an independent state.  That would make a huge difference with how the maquis are treated by the federation.  They wouldn't be outlaws anymore they would be a sovereign state and starfleet would have to follow the prime directive and not interfere in their affairs.   Also make deals with the klingons and or romulans to provide cloaking devices for your ships and missiles.  And maybe even schematics for old cloaking devices that haven't been used in decades so you can build your own.  And once the klingons invade cardassia work with them to bring down the cardassian empire.  

Five establish heavily fortified fall back bases in the badlands and other areas.  So that if you are overrun by the cardassians or the dominion you have somewhere to fall back to.  Once the dominion allies with cardassia you will have fortified planetary defense systems and powerful missiles that can repel jem'hadar warhsips.  So you can push the jem'hadar out of maquis territory.  If not then head for your fallback bases and prepare for war.  

So this is how I think the maquis could have won the war.  Their leaders weren't totally incompetent but they weren't exactly brilliant military strategists either.  Of course most of their leaders were former starfleet officers so that explains their somewhat incompetence when it comes to military strategy.  So  how do you think the maquis could have won the war.  Let me know what you think in the comments."
0,"Hey guys I’ve got a question about a theory. What do you all think of this?

During the Clone Wars a recurring point of political contention is the increasing troop numbers and runaway military expenditure as well as deregulation of the banks to “pay” for the war effort, to which Padame and Bail Organa are strictly opposed, time and again arguing the senate support seeking a peaceful resolution with the immediate goal of drawing down troop numbers and cutting military costs. Each time they are foiled by Palpatine and his minions from a terror bombing of a power station on Courascent to the political assassination of key members of their political faction. The spending and reckless lending sky rockets by the end of the Clone Wars setting up an economic crash on a galactic scale.

The only thing preventing this crash from destroying the nascent First Galactic Empire is the garrison of Clone troops, then Stormtroopers, effectively holding a gun to the head of every planet, this either reduced the impending collapse from the end of the war or nullified it because the first planetary government to say they have no money or that their money is effectively worthless will have a snap election by blaster and be replaced by a government who won’t say that. This thereby ushers in an era of false prosperity in which, despite having no real money the Empire is able to continue spending recklessly, dumping resources into the Death Star projects and enriching the lives of military, political, and business elites who are more than happy to court the Emperor’s favor by any means necessary. Including outlandish ship designs and doctrines designed to reinforce the prosperity through fear approach.

As a result with the fall of the Empire the much delayed economic crash destroys the galactic economy since there is no one to enforce prosperity at the barrel of a blaster, except the Imperial Remnants who are still severely impacted but fair much better than the New Republic. As a result of the crash the New Republic is forced to retire most of their fleet though Mon Mothma attempts to paint this as a pacifist gesture. Furthermore enforcement of the New Republic’s territorial claims is almost impossible, being left to anyone willing to tie themselves to the fledgling republic including rebel war criminals, bounty hunters, and really anyone with a gun tbh. During this time corruption outside its immediate sphere of influence is rampant and imperial remnant forces stake many claims in New Republic territory. Only after 30 years is the New Republic able to repair its economy and build a navy able to enforce it’s territorial claims but with fiscal conservatives wielding the economic crash that resulted from the Old Republic and Empire’s runaway military spending as a big bat which they use to knock military expenditure legislation out of the senate, financing mass production is all but impossible. 

This forces the New Republic to divide its fleet. The New Republic sends small flotillas to its borders to push out the various imperial remnant factions and enforce its claims while keeping the bulk of it’s fleet at anchor in the Hosnian system since the imperial remnants were able to maintain and (in the case of the First Order) expand their fleets posing a dire threat to the New Republic should that fleet leave anchor. So as a means of destabilizing their...would it be geopolitical? We’re not talking about one planet here...galactopolitical opponents and effectively buying time for the New Republican Navy to catch up to the imperial remnant navies, Leia proposes the creation and funding of the Resistance with the goal of destabilizing or destroying the imperial remnant factions on the cheap. 

Which brings us to the 7th movie where they fail miserably and the New Republic and its fleet get blown up (even though SK base could have just sucked up the star of the Hosnian system with similar effect and we could’ve gotten to watch a really big and cool space battle)."

But if it's the romulans I guess they don't really give a damn it's convenient to point to the temporal accord and say they can't interfere.  Even if they don't interfere you would think the romulans would do something about it.  So why didn't they?
1,I would love to see a show revolving around the Temporal Integrity Commission. Seeing them all travel through time and prevent anomalies and stuff. Who all thinks that would make a good series?
0,"Imagine there was a Joel-Ellie-like relationship between Rey and Lor San Tekka where he personally wanted a better life for Rey because one of a Jedi's would always have her in danger as opposed to one that'd be normal, as if almost every kid's dream isn't to hold a lightsaber and become a Jedi, so he selfishly makes that choice for Rey and rips that very opportunity away from her, especially after experiencing a dark vision through the Force of which the academy falls under attack by a group of students that will turn to the dark side and the Imperial Remnant, followed by Rey's mind-wipe and replaced with false memories as she's taken to Jakku or elsewhere by Lor San Tekka to live a normal life where she'll be haunted by the memories in dreams and nightmares, under the guise of wanting nothing but the best for her and to protect her from the many horrors of the galaxy because he feared of losing her that night, knowing she would've been killed there along with the unlucky students that won't escape like the others if he were to stand idly by and do nothing...in hopes Rey never remembers anything or rediscovers her past, believing she's better off this way...that is until her personal droid-friend tracks her down to Jakku with Lor San Tekka after six long years of searching and changes everything, going against Lor San Tekka's wishes as he reminds her of who she once was with recordings, explaining she was one of the many students at Luke's academy, revealing her Jedi training over the years, her friends and family that Tekka wrongly separated her from, their fates unknown to this day, etc.

As for physical evidence, the droid presents Rey with something it recovered from the fallen academy, a lightsaber meant as a special gift that her best friend had built for her, only for him to have been killed that night. This, along with everything else, further motivates Rey to find and reunite with the other students, an adventure that takes her across the galaxy where she soon discovers her best friend is very well alive but there’s something else...He’s Kylo Ren.

1,"Hello everyone. I wanted to post an update to my [post from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ljh44v/new_to_the_whole_series_which_next/) where I asked for some help getting through what I now know were some really troubled episodes.

So, at the time of posting, I had finished Voyager and was feeling quite distraught. I made it through about 10 episodes of TNG, and a few of DS9. I really had no idea where to go from there. I was sad when Voyager ended, but could not find interest in the other series. I turned to you guys, and I have to say, you really, really came through. I cannot thank you guys enough. Covid has been really rough guys, I really needed something to do. You guys have no idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without further ado, lets dive:

I had no idea that early episodes in StarTrek are pretty much universally trash. I decided to start over because I had no idea what was going on. I didn't pay a lot of attention evidently. I utilized two ""Skip lists"" -- [the first, from a long time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1769mz/need_advice_on_watching_tng_over_again/c82lmr5/) and [the second, from my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ljh44v/new_to_the_whole_series_which_next/gnhncup?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (Thanks /u/Kepabar) which I found quite agreeable, and quite enjoyable.   


I am watching on Netflix, so I went down the list. If an episode was on either of those two lists, I would read the description AND give the episode a shot. 5-10 mins, depending on interest. If the episode was not on either of those lists, I read the description and made a decision based on that. This worked very well. The lists were spot on, and absolutely perfect. Now that I am a few episodes into season 3, I can safely say that I now understand, and agree -- early trek is hard! There were one or two episodes not recommended that I found enjoyable, and one or two recommended that I skipped.

Heres what I ended up skipping: S01E02, 03, 06, 10, 11, 15, 19 (half way, lol) S02E02, 18, 19, 21, 22( I was so confused when I did not see a season finale on watch lists. This was fun to find out about. Couldn't bring myself to watch it). Season 2 was much better than Season 1, and Season 3 is great so far.

Whats next? Well, I'll probably finish TNG soon enough, I'm on season 3 now, and so I'll need a similar list for DS9 - my next stop!

^(\*checks notes\*) OK. I fear I am just rambling. I wanted to say thank you, let everyone know what my method was, and what I ended up skipping. Guys and Gals, I can't say thank you enough. You are all amazing. 

TL;DR: Finished Voyager, needed help getting into other series. Posters overwhelmed me with amazing facts and help, which allowed me to weed out the bad episodes and fall in love with TNG. It was all very successful."
0,"Years back (around early 2010s), there was this video on YouTube that I used to watch a lot. It was a Clone Wars game? trailer, I think, with Hollywood Undead's City as background music. It showed two people outside a big castle like building, a jedi, maybe and a character that looked like Xi'an from The Mandalorian. Another character (maybe Ahsoka, I'm not sure) was looking at them from the top of the building holding a knife. Then they go inside the building for some kind of deal, meeting someone (could be Obi-wan, again not sure) but something happens and a full fight breaks out, with an army  coming in and the building ultimately burns down, like the lyrics of the song suggests.    
    
It was one of the most beautiful videos of Star Wars that I had seen, and the song made it even better, but I can't find on YouTube anymore. Anyone have any idea where I can find it?"
0,"I know this is probably an age old question, and I kinda maybe possibly already understand how, but I wanted to check if there was something I'm missing about this.

How exactly did Anakin Skywalker (the chosen one) lose to Obi-Wan? 

Like I get Obi-Wan is talented in defenstive lightsaber combat, but other than that, isn't he known for being very unremarkable in terms of his force abilities?

So given that, how did he beat the literal chosen one? (who keep in mind would have been fueled by the dark side at this point)

Was it literally just down to the high ground, or was more at play here that I'm not seeing?"
1,"I'm currently watching Season 1 of this show. I think that out of every other Star Trek show, the characters here are so war most realistic. The hope, fear, loss, quirks, confusion...they are all etched much more deeply than the characters in any previous Star Trek show. 

But I can't really figure out why? Is this because the characters are portrayed as much closer to our own century (they swear, party, gossip like us) or is this because cinematography has gone leaps and bounds for these past since the early 2000s?

Do you agree with me? If not, why? 

Thanks for the input!"

0,"I’m a big fan of the original trilogy, but I’m of the generation that watched them after the prequels. The Phantom Menace was the first film I saw in cinema (that I can remember, I was 5) and I love the prequels. The sequels I don’t really care about. I’m maybe not enough of a fan for this sub but I’m really curious about Mail. I just saw a short clip of Ezra (about whom I know nothing) from the Rebels series, and I’d really like to know everything that happens to Maul and his outcome. I was obsessed with him as a villain and had his light sabre as a kid. I work and study full time and don’t have the time to watch all the things that would give me answers. I’d love a fan retelling of Maul’s story, especially where he ends up. I really hoped for the sequels the same way I did (still do) the Alien prequels, but I still have an attachment to Star Wars and Maul is one big fat nostalgic reason."

Anyway, if Sheev Palpatine ""encouraged"" Shmi Skywalker's pregnancy (as told in the Darth Vader Comics and in a scene that was cut from Episode III), that makes Ben Solo and Rey quasi kissing cousins.  I guess that would help explain their additional weird Force ""link"" and ""dyad"" through Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, Rey's unexplained connection to Anakin's lightsaber in Episode VII, and how Rey was so much more naturally powerful than Ben Solo besides bad story development and bad movie development (Rey was Palpatine's granddaughter, and Ben would've been his quasi great-grandson, thus he was further removed from Palpatine on the generational plane).  Couple all of this with Leia kissing Luke in Episode V, suddenly Star Wars is a lot more complicated... and in a very strange weird way."

1,"In a way I'm glad they addressed the remains of the sphere from First Contact. But I'm also irritated because the only realistic reason humanity survived was through plot armor.

That's the only reason I can think of as to how the Borg didn't finish assimilating the Earth. Especially once they escaped into open space to regroup and regrow their numbers.

A handful of Borg nearly took over a 24th century crew and ship that was well experienced in fighting Borg. Hell, the Borg even had the NX-01 fully disabled and could've easily transported over to takeover the ship.

The only thing that saved the Earth was plot armor. So, I'm glad they acknowledged the movie, but I'm kinda mad at how they did it."

Starfleet should really consider training and using a group like the spectres.  One spectre is worth a couple dozen regular soldiers.  They would probably be pretty useful against the borg or dominion.  And against the klingons, romulans, and cardassians if they decide to be less then friendly.  More importantly their enemies would fear them.  Because if you cross the federation they will send something similar to spectres after you.  So let me know what you think."

Does it pick up in later seasons? I feel like I could probably get away with skipping ahead since it’s not really serialized. I believe the Borg eventually show up in season 4?"
0,"I always thought that Darth Bane doomed the Sith by creating the rule of two “Always two there are, no more no less, a master and an apprentice” After watching the Old Republic cinematic and seeing all those red lightsabers I thought to myself “Wow, they overpowered the Jedi so easily, imagine an army composed by Maul, Dooku, Savage, Ventress, Sidious, Vader etc. they would be unstoppable”. However, knowing the Sith and their ways to obtain power and knowledge, it would probably be in their nature to turn against each other, giving the Jedi the upper hand. Unless they learn to follow one true master and if anyone has a problem with that to solve it the Mandalorian way. An argument against that would be that the rule of two is the only way to learn the dark side to the fullest potential. Maybe by having more Sith apprentices they will never be as powerful as they would with the rule of two. Thoughts?

Side note: with that logic, I think that the Grey Jedi are the most powerful force users."

0,"Like a lot of people, when Rey said her name was ""Rey Skywalker"" at the end of TROS I cringed and may have audibly groaned. While I could see it coming and thought the sentiment was sweet enough, something about it just felt really dumb and unearned (and I'm not a Rey-hater.)

But before the film came out, speculating on the title, it seemed like a lot of people, myself included, were pretty down for the idea of Rey taking on Skywalker as a title, or as the name for a new style of force user, instead of moving forward as a Jedi.

The reality seemed to rule that out as we're definitely meant to take it that she's going by Skywalker *as opposed to* Palpatine and not for much more reason than that. But does it rule it out? While the film definitely intends it as a surname, I don't see why going forward, when and if something explores her setting up a new Jedi order, or trying to, she couldn't use ""Skywalker"" as a title equivalent to ""Darth,"" for just the leader of the order, or for Jedi that achieve a certain rank, or just for apprentices that are taken on and either don't have known names or want to take on a new identity. It feels to me like that would be a cool way to incorporate the name into future stories that retroactively would make that final TROS moment a bit more meaningful.

TLDR: In the post-TROS future, Skywalker could still be a ""Darth"" type title that Jedi take or are given, for a variety of possible reasons."

As the Battle of Exegol continues, it quickly becomes clear that the Final Order is losing. In the midst of it all, Allegiant General Enric Pryde is contacted by Palpatine, who orders him to have the many Xyston-class Star Destroyers clear a space for a “surprise” Palpatine has planned. Pryde obeys.

The Civilian fleet begins to notice that the star destroyers are creating a hole in their formation, and a rather large one. Poe wonders what they’re doing, then gets an alert from Lando that something is coming out of hyperspace. Something big.

The shot then focuses on the hole in the formation, lingering on it for a few seconds. Then, barreling through Exegol's atmosphere, a huge, black Super Star Destroyer emerges, perfectly filling in the hole in the formation. Shortly after, a bright green streak of light runs across its horizontal vertices, culminating up front of the triangular behemoth. A superlaser blast erupts from the craft, instantly destroying one of the Mon Calamari ships in the civilian fleet.

The Eclipse has entered the battle."

And you follow one symbiote with a new host each season. One time, it's a doctor. Then a captain. Then a helmsmen. Then an admiral. Then literally anything else. 

Each season would be completely different so you could never get redundant or boring, and it makes sense to be so different because of the circumstances. 

I'm just saying, it's a gold mine."

Pong krell is also important to the show, marking the beginning of Jedi realizing how corrupt the order is and turning to the dark side in the show, followed by barris.(but she’s a meh character)

All this to say that my opinion is where it is."
1,"Like many, I hate Picard's mono-fleet. I can conceptually understand why Starfleet may want to transition to fewer ship classes, but I cannot accept that they would have a fleet entirely composed of a single state-of-the-art large class like that ready to mobilize. 20 years ago the Federation left the Dominion War and 10 years ago they lost Utopia Planitia and a huge fleet of ships. Starfleet should be desperate for starships and would easily use the remaining TNG/DS9-era ships, and maybe even some of the stronger TMP era ones as science vassals (though I don't think we should have seen those). Heck we even saw them bringing Disco era ships out of mothball in Children of Mars!

So what gets me the most is that the CGI team had a Galaxy class ship from the first episode. This also means that with very little effort they could have sliced it up and stitched together a Nebula class (as well as a few other kitbashes I'm sure I'm forgetting) that while not exceptional would easily be good enough for the background. And after seeing all the love and effort they put into Discovery's season 3 ships while working from home it just like they downright didn't care. Surly re-creating a Defiant or Akira, while a big task even for a background ship, is easier then designing a brand new ship. Something they then did loads of times for Discovery under worse circumstances. Even a 90% Inquiry fleet would have appeased me

Admittedly it would be a bit unusual to have that and no DS9 era ships, particularly a Galaxy and no Sovereign class. But that can be waved away with the old ""nearest ships"" argument and we could just say the Federation made very few Sovereign class ships before transitioning to the Inquiry class while the Galaxy class was much longer lived during a time of peace and bountiful resources. Sure people would have complained but more so then with the mono-fleet? This is Star Trek, some people will always complain about something. As it stood a lot of people spent the final scene going ""Oh my god why is there only one ship?!"" and many still don't really see the actually quite good design of that ship. Even then it took awhile for a lot of people to appreciate it (for me it wasn't until I saw the Eaglemoss model of it)"

1,"I was recently started designing movie posters for the western themed episodes from each series. I decided to mimic the poster designs for the films that inspired these episodes, some of which are more obvious than others. My goal was that at a glance they might be mistaken for posters for original films of the era. Some of these still need work but they're all at a point now where I'm happy to show them off.

0,"I thought about it a few days ago. When we all saw Snoke in Episode VII, one of the main things everyone was talking about was his backstory. What was his species? Where did he come from? Was he more powerful than Vader or Palpatine? When did he take Kylo Ren as his apprentice?

Then, the countless theories emerged. ""Snoke is Darth Plagueis"", ""Snoke is Darth Vader"", ""Snoke is the one younling we see in Episode III""... god, I even heard that Snoke was Luke's spouse deformed and wanting revenge. It was funny because Snoke could be anyone, or maybe something completely new. Everyone had his own personal opinion. And then, the first Episode VIII trailer came out.

At that point, everyone was asking himself who the hell Snoke was. We saw him not in an hologram, but physically, torturing Rey. I remember different people of the Star Wars media stating that he was, in fact, more powerful than the Emperor was, and that at some point of his life he met Luke and confronted him. The New Republic was said to be responsible for his scars too, being this the reason of his hatred towards them. I'm sure we all had great hopes for such a villain...

But then he died.

And two years later, he was simply said to be a clone.

What was your experience with Snoke? What were your theories? Did you like him? Personally, I never believed him to be stronger than Palpatine, but a clone? Really? Man of his talents?"
0,"Just re-watching all the movies and I noticed we always see such small portions of the Empires/First Orders army. Like thinking about the size of their ships and the amount I'm always surprised by how small their ground forces are. I'm on the 8th movie and it just seems to weird how small the attack against the mine is. Surely they would have hundreds if not thousands AT-AT's and hundreds of thousands of troops? I feel like even a half decent sized force could have defeated the Resistance. Yeh I know Snoke's ship went down but it looks liked there were quite a few Star Destroyers there and in other parts of the universe.

0,"This is my opinion on why people think this way.

It is probably because of the marketing and slick and cool designs of these characters, as well as astounding performances from the actors, these two are made for the story to have someone to fill the shoes of minor leader (Hux) and minor obstacle (Phasma). I do think that because people were attached to these characters, they should've made them more prevalent after TFA (I like Hux in TLJ and TROS though). Phasma was also made for Finn to have character development, and the slick design she has gave more attention to her than we should've."

1,"I think an argument can be made that Hard Time (S4 E18) might be the best stand alone episode of DS9.

1,"What an episode. Where do I even begin. I think the way the crew go back and forth over their feelings about whether to stay or not shows what a difficult decision it would be to choose between the here and now and the possible consequences of actions/inactions. Initially Sisko tries to decide for them, but then even O'Brien changes his mind. Just watching that being wrenched around i appreciated how delicately this was written. The scenes between Odo and Kira were really well done too, I really feel this was Rene Auberjonois' best turn in the role. I wonder where the outside scenes were shot. Such beautiful scenery - the wind on the hills was somehow kept out of the soundtrack! One more - the scene with Sisko and his descendent child was so nice - Avery Brooks was so good with him, clearly such a joyous scene to shoot."

1,"Obviously we don't know the answer, but I'm curious what people would guess...

Dr. Bashir's parents seem to be quite average - they aren't famous, wealthy, or high-ranking in any way we know. Yet they were able to find and pay a doctor to have Julian genetically enhanced. No doubt, this was risky for them, and surely involved sacrifice, but my point is that average Federation citizens managed to have this procedure done.

We have seen a very small number of genetic-enhancements gone wrong, but Bashir is the only example we know of (during DS9's time) where a genetic enhancement went well. This tells me there could be quite a few more who have managed to do a better job of hiding.

We only know that this procedure is illegal in the Federation. Are there places where it is legal? Could it even be common somewhere?"

Where is this (very large) worm sitting in a Trill's body? Or a human for that matter (ie: Riker, Adira)? In an intestine? Would that...there isn't a bulge on either of their bodies anywhere. Is there a pouch? Are symbionts the night bus? (There is no way that a pouch of empty space exists in a Trill. Reason 1: That would be so prone to infection. Reason 2: Trills only started joining with symbionts in the 1200s. THat's not enough time to evolve a major feature.)

How where symbionts implanted before surgeries?? Were they swallowed? Inserted through the butt? WHAT???

Trills only started being joined in the 1200s, they said that on DS9. Do you expect me to believe that these slug dudes were just chilling in these electric ponds for millennia, evolving and doing there slug things and not dying out by being eaten or having their water de-electrified or something?

0,"So, I was rewatching the Clone Wars and got to the Lair of Grievous episode. It got me thinking how he became the way he is now, since I never actually read up on it other than he was a proud warrior.

Anyway, after research, his history is pretty tragic. He was a proud leader of his people, fell in love with another of them. She died in battle and he was so struck with grief he called himself Grievous from then on and would be heartbroken forever.

When his home was invaded by the Huk people, the Jedi sided with them and forced Grievous and his people back where they were left to starve and die. When the Huk army came back, the Jedi did nothing to help, so that built up his rage against them.

For help, he reached out to the banking clan, who had him become an enforcer for them in exchange for helping his people. When he went home because of the Huk army acting up again, and wanting revenge, the baking clan and their alliance with Dooku planned a bomb to blow up on his ship. That way he could be used for the Siths goals in the upcoming war. Dooku then lied and convinced Grievous it was the Jedi who tried to assassinate him. He was then turned into a cyborg to keep him alive, and he became a serious threat to the galaxy.

His life sucked, yo. He loses his love, gets turned away by the Jedi, gets betrayed by the ones who helped him, and is being used by the Sith as a tool. I feel sorry for the guy honestly.

That was my thoughts on it until I found out that's in Legends. The canon history isnt even expanded like that. All they said was he was a great warrior, attracted the attention of the Sith, they shot down his ship and then salvaged him to be used. No heartbreak, no honor on the line, no reason why he changed his name, nothing.

Kinda sucks we dont have the Legends Grievous. I like that one better."

Back in the day when I was a kid ROTJ was a film we all needed to wait years to see after Empire stet the bar so impossibility high, and ep6 had a lot to offer, but boy did folks hate the Ewoks. The JarJar hate has been the only thing to eventually take the sting out of these furry marketing missteps years later. So it was hard even for a kid to give a cartoon about them a chance. Droid I remember watching hoping it would get better, but when you're starving for more content, you take what you can get. But I also watched Ewoks as a jagged pill to try and get more star wars fix, but it I was so biased as a fan, it was hard to enjoy for what it was.

I've been watching it now again with my kids, and I have to say, I was far too hard on it. The animation is great for the time, and voice actors all come from other classic Canadian cartoon projects like The Raccoons. The most surprising thing is the writing. Paul Dini has been the writer for all the episodes I've seen again so far, and despite the demographic, he crafted unique stories and characters. 

If you have younglings, I highly recommend going into the way-back machine, and giving Ewoks another chance."

1,"The previous longest gap between Star Trek movies was 6 years, 4 months, 25 days, which was the time between Star Trek Nemesis and Star Trek 09. We are currently approaching nearly 5 years since Star Trek Beyond released in 2016. Nothing is in production, although numerous directors and scripts have come and gone. If nothing comes out by December 22, 2022, which seems highly likely considering recent reports suggest they only JUST hired somebody to begin writing a movie in the last month or so, it'll be the longest drought between Star Trek movies since they started making them in 1979.

My question is, why is it so hard for Paramount to greenlight a project? At one point it seemed like there were 3 different scripts in development, but none of them have materialized into a concrete production. I know there have been various levels of strife - pay disputes with Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth (who they wanted to bring back), Tarantino waffling over wanting to do a movie, Bad Robot bailing from Paramount, Paramount's parent company Viacom overall being in awful financial shape - but you can't make money if you don't make something new.

With so many Star Trek television productions going right now, you'd think the time is right to make a new movie. And it's not like Paramount has too many franchises clogging up their schedule. Transformers does well enough but who knows how long it'll be until people get tired of those, and Mission Impossible is a Tom Cruise vehicle and will only go on as long as he's physically able to do them... and the dude's approaching 60. Star Trek is BY FAR their biggest living universe with the potential to tell a huge variety of stories that share the same DNA and either loosely or strongly interconnect with each other. So why the hesitation? Even if you can't line up all the right pieces for a tentpole blockbuster film, there's nothing stopping them from greenlighting some smaller, lower budget stories. Heck they should know that - some of the best Star Trek ever was made creatively on a shoestring budget.

I don't know, it just seems like horrible mismanagement to me. Say what you will about Kurtzman (and I have a LOT to say about what he's done and would prefer to see him move on) but at least he's been able to get things off the ground on the TV side of things. I know a lot of people think Star Trek is better off living on TV, and I generally agree, but I really do love a good Trek flick and don't want to see them end. I just watched Beyond again and I miss those contained 2-hour romps."

With this in mind, I find the dialogue less cheesy/awkward and more old-timey/charming.

1,"I’m looking forward to this series immensley. I hope this series does for Trek what the Mandalorian did for Star Wars, which is to unify the fanbase. That is a high set of expectations I know, but based on what I’ve seen, they are heading in the right direction.

What the Mandalorian did well was a few things. One, they went back to their roots. They got back into the original sandbox of Star Wars. Two, they made the stories smaller. Every episode doesn’t need the universe to hang in the balance. Three, good characters. I can’t stress this enough. Give me at least 3 characters I can ride or die with. That’s pretty much it. 

The reason I think they have a chance to do something special is, if you’ve seen Pike, Spock &amp; Number One on Disco, chances are you’re in love already. I’m a TOS man, and I am in love so far. I know their version of the TOS Enterprise isn’t “canon” as far as how it looks now, but I love it. I haven’t loved a Trek ship this much since the 1701 &amp; 1701-A. 

They’ve also said they’ll be doing an “emotional serialized” arc for a season, meaning if someone loses a loved one, that isn’t conveniently forgotten by the next episode, but they would go back to the “alien of the week” type Trek. I think this could be the sweet spot they’ve been looking for. Modern serialized storytelling is great. I’m a big fan, but the drawback is, individual episodes on Disco are harder to recall what scene happened in which episode. TOS is very clear cut. “Oh that’s the episode with two Kirks” LOL. Just an observation.

That’s pretty much it. I’d like to hear if anybody else has good vibes from this or what."

The way I see it going is they meet have a rematch but this time Vader get the better of Obi and has him where he can kill him but will let’s him go, hence the ‘you should not have come back’ and also keeps in with the fact that there was always good in Anakin, Sorry if this turns out to be a spoiler lol but god I’m so ready for this show.

1,It is an insane amount of danger and responsibility.  Not only is it your responsibility to try to not get hundreds or thousands of people on your ship killed.  Your also responsible for their actions.  So if one of them commits a crime you take the fall for it.  In combat hundreds of lives are riding on your every decision.  Also in ground engagements the captain is the high value target.  Because you know things the enemy wants to know.  Fortunately for them starfleet uniforms make it easy to identify command officers.  And if that wasn't enough you have a ton of rules and regulations that in a lot of situations restrain you from actually being able to make make a difference.

0,"Since they’re available again on Disney + I was wondering if this very important question had been resolved. Having watched both movies I feel very strongly that they are canon. Firstly, they have all the misery and tragedy that is inherent in Star Wars. Secondly, I feel like the family and world, the whole thing, is very authentic, whatever that means for Ewoks. But most importantly, the stories for the tv movies are both by George Lucas so how can they not be canon? 

So I was wondering what people think. A simple agree or disagree would also be helpful to resolve this."

0,"I don’t want to slag the book off because I don’t know if it’s just me, I see reviews are generally positive so I’m sort of thinking I’m the odd one out.
I’m listening to the audio book, about two thirds of the way through. I’m thinking it’s partly to do with the Audio book that’s the problem and if i was reading it I might be enjoying it more so I’d be interested to hear from people who have done both.
I just can’t get out of my head that the whole book is just one big Jedi circle jerk, it’s just puts them all on a giant pedestal and worships them. There’s so much descriptive writing as well that just embellishes them and whatever they’re doing.
Marc Thomson, who is a veteran narrator of Star Wars novels and I have enjoyed hours and hours of his work listening to previous, now Legends book series narrates this book but everything is read in a higher inflection making every sentence seem SO important even if it’s just describing a setting and then when things do ramp up it’s seems so over the top it’s jarring and irritating.
The overall subject of the book is really interesting, getting into the science of hyperspace. But the characters in and around the subject are failing to keep me fully engaged.

Again I’m just interested to hear peoples thoughts, I will persevere with the book and get it done but not sure I will race straight into the next one.
Thank you."
1,"In the alternate future of that episode, the big E gets a fair few ""improvements"".   
Obviously, you have the third nacelle , the cloak and the phaser lance on the ventral surface of the saucer...  
On the dorsal portion, starboard and port of the bridge superstructure, we have what appears to be two huge cannon emplacements or turrets that have a certain Klingon feel to them, but what are they actually supposed to be?  
I mean, is it ever explicitly stated? I'm a little foggy and rusty and only thought about it today when examining one of my models.

1,"I've heard of a couple of notable Star Trek actors who were briefly considered, but ultimately rejected, for main roles.  The ones I know of are:

* Lawrence Montaigne (""Stonn"" from Amok  Time) was runner-up to play Spock
* Billy Campbell (""The Outrageous Okona"") was the second choice to play Riker
* Eric Menyuk (The Traveller) was almost cast as Data.
* Tim Russ was runner-up to play LaForge before he got the role of Tuvok
* Genevieve Bujold was hired, and actually started working for a day or two as Captain Janeway, before she quit and got replaced by Kate Mulgrew

Are there any other examples that people are aware of?  How would the respective series have been different if the alternate choices made it instead of the ones that we actually saw?"

1,"So many posts lately about how much people love Tuvok, which is shocking because I assumed he was always one of the least liked characters on voyager next to Neelix, Kes and Chakotay. 

I think the writers really didn’t know how to write Vulcans. With Spock it was easier because he was half human so they would inject personality, humour and a snarky sarcasm to him, but with Tuvok they just went for “stick in the mud”. 

All he does in multiple episodes is complain and antagonise Neelix (for someone so unemotional he sure had a lot of emotions against Neelix). 

The writers also seemed to not realise what unemotional means for Vulcans: Vulcans were never meant to be bland or like robots. They just completely bury their emotions to achieve heightened rationality and a peaceful state of mind. How is being constantly annoyed with Neelix (verging on xenophobia) rational? 

It’s a shame as well because Tim Russ is actually a good actor but the material he was given to work with is abysmal. Maybe it also had to do with the fact that most (if not all) Tuvok-centric episodes are some of the stoat episodes on voyager.

At the end of the day I think Tuvok suffered from the same fate as Chakotay: the writers just didn’t know how to make him interesting and write good episodes about him. It’s hard to write a compelling story about someone who has the personality of a block of wood. 

Am I the only one thinking this? Thoughts?"

1,"For several years, I’ve been watching Trek in the [“Chronology Project”](http://thestartrekchronologyproject.blogspot.com/2009/09/and-now-conclusion.html?m=1) order. I’ve reached the point where Voyager begins and alternates episodes with DS9 - but I’m enjoying DS9 so much that I’m considering scrapping the chronology thing altogether. What I *don’t* know is whether or not the events of DS9 impact Voyager’s story or vice-versa. (I’ve never seen DS9 before, and while I watched several seasons of Voyager - and liked it - that was back when the show was first airing, and I don’t remember a whole lot).

If they do overlap, then I might continue on by stardate. It’s been fun to go through the “history” of Trek, and I’ve come this far.

But if they’re largely independent plots (which seems likely), it might be nice to stick with one crew at a time - especially given all the great things I’ve read here about DS9’s characters. Also, Discovery thoroughly hosed up my chronology...and since I’m not going to start all over again, I’ll be switching to watching-by-series at some point anyway. Also also, it’s a lot easier to just let Netflix roll the next episode without checking my list...

I figured as long as I’m mulling over what I want to do, I might as well seek advice from the experts!

1,"I'm making this post to discuss two things. Hats and Odo.

 We first met Dr. Mora, the scientist that worked with Odo, he has hair exactly like Odo's. This was cool, a nod to the fact that Odo had taken more from Dr. Mora than he would like to admit. Then at the end of season 2 they changed that to the fact that all changelings had hair like that. It made me sad that they didn't explore Odo's complex relationship with Dr. Mora more. 

Hats. The closest thing I can find to hats in TNG/DS9/VOY (The only 3 series I've watched all the way through), were the Ferengi headbands. With the exception of baseball caps and vedek hats in DS9, there is a surprising lack of hats in Star Trek. In the real militaries of today hats are an important ceremonial part and I was surprised that almost no species seemed to have them in their military. I feel that it would have made sense for Starfleet dress uniforms to include a hat, or including them in the uniforms of one of the recurring species. Hats would have fit well with Romulans, Vidiians, and Bajorans other than religious figures, but we saw only a few hats over all those series."

1,"Something for the german Trek fans

I recently acquired VHS tapes containing the very strange alternative german dub for Star Trek TNG.

Ahead of the debut on german television the first 14 episodes were released as rental only VHS tapes. Each tape contained 2 episodes cut into a movie with a new title.

The dub features a completely different voice cast with some (in)famous german voice actors, and a completely different and hillariously terrible new translation. Other infos are quite sparse:
https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/de/wiki/Synchronisation#CIC-Synchronisation_.281987.2F1988.29

It was impossible to find any examples of it on the internet, so I transferred the episodes.

So, do the events of enterprise and discovery (season 1 and 2) happen in the kelvin timeline? 

If Khan is defeated for good sooner in Kirk's career (into Darkness) does that mean his son could survive in future events. 

Does section 31 of the kelvin time line know about Nero and Spock (I assume they would, for sure after the events of the movie) and if so why would section 31 not be working on red matter travel (star trek 4 maybe, bring it all full circle and into the main time line) 

Also, the events of star trek 4 could not happen in the kelvin time line. And that's just sad."

Ezra becoming a selfess hero is cheap. we have already seen plenty of heroic Jedi, we have rarely seen a Jedi that is more a ""Rouge"" than a ""Paladin"" (in Dungeon and Dragons terms).

Ezra was at is best when he was a selfish, cynical, happy go lucky, street thief.

his interactions with Hondo, Vizago, Lando Carrisian and other ""shady"" characters were always fun and maked him a more unique character.

in the last seasons of Rebels he was a bad copy of Luke.

in the first seasons he was ""Space Aladdin"". even if many peapole disliked this aspect of his character.

1,"(Spoiler alert!!!) I have been watching Enterprise and if anyone has seen it all the way through than they would have come across an episode that strikes a moral debate that isn’t easy to ignore. The episode in question that has unnerved me to the point of writing this post is called the Cogenitor. In this episode, captain Archer and the crew of the enterprise, come in contact with a race of explorers after investigating a hypergiant star. The captain of the ship proceeds to take a shuttle pod with captain archer for three days to examine the hypergiant star more closely. Meanwhile, on the enterprise, the crew is socializing with the other species and getting to know them. Commander tucker gets to know the engineer of the other ship and his wife. I’m doing so, he also comes in contact with the third gender of their species while have lunch with them. They pay very little attention to this person and explain to commander Tucker that the person has no name and is only there to facilitate the conception of their baby. You find out later on that the people in this species who are of this third gender have little to no rights, they are not allowed to read, and have no say in the matter of the reproduction of this baby. In essence they are also using these third gendered beings bodies for the purpose of reproduction without consent. Commander tucker is upset by this information and begins to covertly introduce this nameless person to literature and culture. He teaches them how to read in a day and takes them for a tour on the enterprise. After discovering that commander tucker had been doing these things, the people of this species bar him from entering their ship. But the nameless person sneaks onto the enterprise and asks to be given asylum because they feel that they will not be treated fairly. When captain archer returns and finds out what had been going on, he holds commander tucker in contempt and eventually hands the nameless person back to their people. The enterprise doesn’t get far before they are contacted with the news that the nameless person had committed suicide. The last scene shows captain archer berating commander tucker for the choices he made and blaming him for this beings suicide. 
I was really disappointed with how captain archer handled the situation. I understand the complexities of the situation and feel that diplomacy is important in this situation. However, I can’t seem to ignore the blatant disregard for human rights displayed in this episode. And if we are going to get into semantics than I would just reword human rights to sentient-beings rights. Tell me what you guys think. Is it okay to turn a blind eye to this kind of thing? It may be a cultural norm for them but does that ever make it right to diminish a certain type of person?"

The actors like Stewart and Spiner were getting more costly as TNG became more successful so Paramount figured it was better to just make films.

So in that situation, why would Frakes and Sirtis hold a grudge against DS9? They became movie stars with Generations and Frakes got to direct high profile films.

0,"I just rewatched the season 2 finale of Star Wars Rebels and damn that endings good. The track is perfect, Ahsoka meeting Anakin as Vader and then saying, ""I won't leave you. Not this time."" And he looks at her and says, ""Then you will die."" Oh its beautiful. Sure, Ezra's a whiny kid but now he's been introduced to Maul and the dark side and hates Vader and the Empire for killing now his parents but also Ahsoka (or so he thought), giving him very nice character development and many paths open. And then Rex's reaction to Ahsoka's supposed death is perfect, like a soldier. Saddned and broken, but says nothing. Love it so much."
1,"A ongoing theme within the universe is that characters behave within close confines of what their species is expected to do. Its easy to draw parallels from this to race oriented stereotype in our world. Apart from humans, the most defining aspect of every character, of how they would act normally or under pressure--is their race. I believe there was some mumbo jumbo about it in the last/second last season of Enterprise as well - the fact that humans can be as logical as vulcans, passionate as X, etc., and are thus uniquely positioned amongst all the species. 

Case in point: TNG Season 3, Episode 19 - an exhausted Picard is on vacation at Risa, where a Ferengi confronts him about something. His response: ""You'll find that Ferengi demands carry very little weight with me."" I could write this off as just him expressing federation's technological superiority over the Ferengis but I think it is a representative of how the audience is expected to think of _all_ of them.

All too commonly characters claim ""your species is too weak"", ""your species is too barbaric"", and so on. I find it slightly unsettling, and a bit problematic. Rarely do individuals to determine their behaviour, and act out of the box their species has been type-casted as.  

Am I misinterpreting something? Has this been talked about in this sub? If so, what are some common counter arguments?"

1,"I've known about Star trek mostly though references in other shows like futurama (""Where no fan has gone before"" is a great episode). I never really got into it but i ended up watching lower decks and really enjoying it. I'm watching discovery at the moment and i'm liking that a lot too but i'm aware a lot of ""veteran fans"" are maybe not so fond of those so i'd like to ask, which sereis did you start with?

1,"So, we know Spock was science officer under Pike, before Kirk became Captain, but do we know much about the rest of the crew? Like, were Scotty or Uhura stationed there pre-Kirk?

Mostly I'm just thinking in terms of *Strange New Worlds*, if it's likely that any other recognisable characters might show up as part of the ensemble (either in the first series or later ones)."

1,"I think Picard is a lot like The Last Jedi.  I haven't looked at the RottenTomatoes score lately but I know when it came out, it was widely lauded by critics.  It took Star Wars in a new direction, subverted many of the classic tropes, and opened the door for widening the Star Wars universe in different ways by lessening the dependence of the story on the Skywalker family.

It also took a wet, flaming dump on the face of Star Wars' own established canon and Luke Skywalker's established character traits of optimism and determination.  Many, many fans were rightly outraged by this.  

There are also fans who will buy BB-8 toothpaste and will support anything else worth a Star Wars logo on it, regardless of quality or content.  So they didn't care.

There are of course fans in the middle who weren't necessarily happy with the changes, but were excited to see their old heroes in action again.  This is probably the majority honestly.

And naturally, many folks who never liked Star Wars in the first place really liked what Star Wars was doing by changing up the formula, and this is where your high critic score comes from.


Star Trek is experiencing The Last Jedi with Picard especially.  There is an extensive established character for who Picard is, what the Federation is and stands for, and a well known story bible for how to portray these attitudes and ideals in the Star Trek universe.  The original Star Wars story is a very simple good vs evil fantasy told in 3 parts.  Star Trek has many, many times more established canon.  

But Picard picks up the story from TNG, which is easily the most optimistic and professional ""in the heart of the Federation and it's ideals"" show and instead attempts to subvert that and show that humanity and the Federation was never anything special at all.  There were always bad admirals in the show, (it was basically it's own trope) or bad apples here and there (Ro Laren or Tom Paris types).  But these were always presented as an exception that proves the rules that the Federation, and Earth in particular, is a good, decent place that has overcome the frailties of its past.

Anyway, I don't begrudge folks who like The Last Jedi or Picard, because of course everyone is entitled to their own tastes.  But I do feel that folks who like Picard with no reservations are a lot more likely to be people who will eat up anything with the Star Trek logo, or people who didn't watch and love the originals.

I didn't appreciate what happened to Luke Skywalker, and I definitely don't appreciate what's happened to Picard, one of the most respectable characters in television history, and his beloved Federation.



(Discovery gets a semi pass from me even though I think it's poorly written and don't care for it, but it technically exists in an alternate timeline or whatever so they can do whatever dumb stuff they want)"
1,"Paradoxes aside... I love the time related episodes in the Trek TV series (don't get me started on the Kelvin timeline).

Hey guys, I've been wondering for ages what the name is of the episode where a Starfleet woman seemingly trapped on a planet communicates with the crew of Voyager, and the crew try and rescue her, but when they get there, they realise that's she's been dead for many years, and that she was talking to the crew through some kind of wormhole or phenomenon that was sending her signal to the future, and Voyager's signal back to the past.

I'm pretty sure it's in Voyager, but it may be in one of the earlier shows.

Thx guys!"

1,"I'm not talking about bringing old Actors to do cameos as their same former Character.  I'm talking about how Star Trek used to always use former guest stars to come back on and play new characters.  It was always fun to try and spot under all that makeup someone from a past episode that was someone completely different.  James Cromwell and Jeffrey Alan Combs are the biggest examples that come to mind.

Unless the makeup has gotten so good or they have gotten so old that I'm not recognizing former guest stars... I'm fairly certain there haven't been.  I would imagine those regulars that were obviously huge fans of Trek are pretty upset right now."

0,"My friends want to argue they Rey is a Jedi, besides the fact only Masters may appoint someone as a Jedi Knight, and a padawan in training isn’t a Jedi, as we see in Return of the Jedi Vader says Luke isn’t a Jedi meaning that would apply to Rey meaning she also isn’t a Jedi, plus Luke would be unable to appoint her a Jedi Knight."
0,Help me out with this. Why do people always think there are going to be flashbacks? The only flashbacks I can think of being in Star Wars is in the last Jedi. Am I wrong. This isn’t a thing really in Star Wars but for some reason everyone keeps saying every new project will have tons of flashbacks. Just curious. Feel free to tell me how wrong I am.
1,"Yes, it's pretty clear it was made due to some constraints (I thought maybe some leads were on vacation until I found out it was due to budgeting).

However, it's not as much of a slog as I was expecting it to be on my rewatch. At least there are breaks from the old clips when they go back to the doctor and Troi.
I can also imagine that if I were watching the episodes as they were being aired, some of the clips would've been a year old and I may have forgotten them.

I definitely recommend fast forwarding the repeat clips at 1.5x or 2x speed, though. Overall I wouldn't miss this episode if it didn't exist but it doesn't create a visceral hate in me as it seems to do for some other people :)"
1,"For those who weren't aware(and I don't think there are many who weren't) , after TNG Jonathan Frakes hosted an anthology show called Beyond Belief.

I was watching through some episodes to kill time and got to Season 2 Ep 3. The first segment comes in and hey what do you know its future Enterprise star John Billingsly, that's a fun little coincidence I think to myself.

A couple segments go by and to my surprise up pops Picard star Michelle Hurd! Three Star Trek main cast members randomly in an anthology show together. It isn't even Gargoyles. Finally I'm watching the final segment about some kids at a camp and one of them looks familiar. It can't be… and yet I check on it and sure enough it's a 12 year old Aldis Hodge, the star of the short Trek Calypso. Now that one I probably wouldn't have picked up if I hadn't watched Calypso a dozen times, the best piece of Trek in the Era IMO."
0,"First, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars.
But I would like to say that I hate this character so much.

He represents all the bad aspects of the Jedi Order. We all know it.

But, I also hate the fact that he is given so much credit whereas he really did nothing.

""He is the strongest Jedi.""
Why? He has no feats.

""He uses Vaapaad."" 
I find this so dumb, a power that is a mirror to dark side. With that, he cannot be beaten, it's stupid.

""His lightsaber represents his ability to embrace both sides of the Force.""
No. It is just a whim from Samuel L. Jackson who wanted to be seen better in the Geonosian arena."

0,"If you know, you know."
1,"...that an episode with a reasonably interesting premise and buildup has such a bad case of plot armor at the end, even by Trek standards. I really like the idea of the episode; that a group of scared cadets can fall victim to a cult of their leader's hubris. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief that a ship could survive behind enemy lines at warp &lt;4 for months. I love the idea that there's this amazing buildup to a plan that just fails.

But I'm SO SICK of Trek episodes having everyone, **everyone** die other than the main characters. My suspension of disbelief can maybe believe that the ship can last for minutes while it's being assaulted by a Dominion battleship, I guess. Maybe the entire rest of the bridge crew dies, fine. But that Nog and the acting chief have time to get to Jake in the brig, get to an escape pod, and then they're the *only* pod that survives? The episode even goes out of its way to show the other pods being destroyed. It just takes me out of the episode that out of all 37 people on board, it was our 2 main characters and the one member of red squad that we have emotional attachment to that survive.

Then again, maybe I'm just crabby that Profit and Lace started autoplaying as I've been writing this... Thanks for letting me vent, /r/startrek."

Is a Star Wars galaxy-spanning civilisation actually impossible, because regardless of transport method, every planet's gravity impacts the way time flows on it? I.e - relativity.  

^ For example: Luke leaves Tatooine, visits Hoth, goes back to Tatooine and realises thousands of years have passed, even though the round-trip journey only took him days.  

Therefore, gravity+relativity renders galactic communication, commerce and governance impossible. :(

1,"I'm laid up for a couple days after getting my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine (yay!), so I'm finally sitting down to watch Short Treks. I've had CBS All Access for 2 years, but just haven't had the time to devote to these little gems - apart from *having* to watch the first one because of its tie-in with regular-season DiscoTrek (little kids and work and all that).

I just finished *The Brightest Star,* and it struck me just how foundational this short story really is - not just to *Discovery*, but in fact to all of Star Trek.

So keep in mind, I watched Disco Season 2 *The Sound of Thunder* first. Basically, this episode is where the Kelpiens regain their freedom from the Ba'ul, thanks to Captain Pike ""doing the right thing"" (use of this term is probably debatable, but for the purposes of this post, that's the term I'm going with).

By season 3 of Disco, Kelpiens are now spread throughout the known galaxy. They were apparently at some point a member planet of the Federation (I haven't researched this issue enough, so please don't ding me if I have that partially or wholly incorrect). And let's not forget that The Burn was caused by a Kelpien child with genetic mutations.

And quite literally none of this would have happened, at all, if there was just better quality control on the Ba'ul ship that lost that piece of communications equipment. The same piece of communications equipment that Saru used to contact Starfleet, which resulted in Captain Georgiou ""rescuing"" Saru.

*The Brightest Star* was by no means a story that Star Trek was required to tell. But when they did, it really was an eye opener! I really, *really* enjoyed it."
1,"I just wish there were more queer women in star trek. And more specifically I wish there was a lesbian couple I could really root for. Seven and Raffy are probably going to be a couple but honestly I'm not excited about them together bc they spoke maybe once in the whole first season and have very little chemistry in my opinion.

In general I haven't cared much about any of the romantic pairings in the new trek shows. Stamets and Culber and Michael and Booker are okay. Adira and Grey are sweet. Jurati and Rios are absolute dumpster fire garbage and I despise that pairing so much I could make an entire separate post about why. 

I know romance isn't the main point of Trek but I just want a couple that makes me root for them the way Tom and B'elanna did. Their relationship is one of my favorites in trek. 

I know it's likely never going to happen and a lot of people won't agree with me but I really could see Detmer and Owo becoming a couple. They have great chemistry and had some very sweet moments in season 3. I know a lot of people think they're better left as friends but I think they'd make a great couple."

1,"During the third season of Star Trek: Discovery it is said that there hasn’t been a crossing with the mirror universe and the prime universe since the 27th century, but what exactly caused the rift between the universes is left vague.

My theory is that the Prime Universe and the Mirror Universe are no longer aligned because they are no longer mirrors of each other.

In the TNG episode “Parallels” Worf is accidently transported to various other “Quantum Realities”. what’s interesting is that every reality he is transported to is only slightly different than the one he was just in. This suggests that it is easier to travel to universes that are more similar to your own.

If this fact is consistent with the mirror universe then it could explain away the nearly impossible state of the Terran Empire, where every person has a mirror despite the ludicrously low chance of the same egg and sperm combination occurring in too different universes, as when there are an infinite number of realities these impossible similarities will eventually happen and there are trillions of universes that didn’t quite match up.

So, what if the fact that the Mirror Universe has moved further away is due to the fact that the Federations’ mirror, the Terran Empire, has collapsed and now differences in the two universes are beginning to be more apparent, and by the 27th century it’s got next to no parallels with the prime universe and crossings become virtually impossible."

I did just pause the episode to post this question here, so I guess if this is somehow explained in the second half of the episode I'll remove this...

1,"So I know I worded that really strangely but I can't figure out a way to make it sound quite right. Basically, what I'm asking is: What parts of star trek bother you the most? Which ones seem far too unrealistic? Which things just don't make sense conceptually? I know we're talking about a show where people fly around in space with replicators and transporters and battle against evil robots and sludge monsters but there are always some things that make you stop and go ""...wait, what?""

One of my biggest pet peeves comes in one of my favorite TNG episodes and it's such a stupid little thing but it's always bothered me. There's an episode where Geordi and Ro end up out of phase with the rest of the enterprise and they end up running through walls, people, computers, etc. They can't interact with anything except for the floor apparently. The fact that they can still walk around without issue has always bothered me and I yet to hear a good reason why they're able to do this. Another thing is how selective the universal translator is but I've already made a post about that one.

1,"I watched Star Trek a lot as a younger teenager, but I never caught onto the heavy themes of equality, optimistic futurism, and community like I do now in my early twenties. 

I’ve been binging TOS when I’m not working or doing schoolwork, and it’s been such an uplifting and inspiring experience. 

Slowly watching all the official series’ and movies has now become my main hobby since I cannot do anything else between work and online college classes. 

Now that I’ve about finished TOS, I really loved The Galileo Seven from season one. Seems like one episode I don’t hear too much about. The episodes where Spock is forced to value emotion over his intense logic are just my favorite. This Side of Paradise and, of course, Amok Time are some other excellent examples. 

I know this is a rambling post, but I figure this is free place to just celebrate Star Trek—especially in dark times like this. 

I’m planning on just watching everything by (almost) order of release. I’ve seen all the movies and most of TNG, but I’ve never looked into the other shows. Looking forward to seeing them all. With all the new CBS All Access shows coming out, I know I have a lot to catch up on. 

I hope everyone on here is doing well and appreciating the awesomeness of Star Trek through the pandemic too. It’s definitely been a huge diamond among this massive mess we’re all surviving right now."
1,"Let’s put aside the fact that some people hate Discovery for a minute. I like it very much and I think that either way this would be very nice.

The episode states that about 710 years after Voyager a backup copy of the Doctor went home to earth in a (presumable very fast) small craft. I say presumably fast because the  people in the episode had been warp-capable for centuries at that point.

Here’s what could be discussed.
1. Why the burn and/or dilithium shortages either didn’t happen or were much less bad in the Delta Quadrant 
2. What his ship ran on if it wasn’t dilithium, as Book already ruled out Quantam Slipstream and other known forms of travel
3. What happened to the Hirogen and other species seen in Voyager; on Hirogen said in Voyager that no one would remember them in a thousand years old f they didn’t change their ways, so it would be interesting to see what happened to them nearly a thousand years later.

Plus, not Robert Picardo is always better."

1,"Omg why did they leave Zio behind?! He was crazy but 6+ years of having that brain implant would make anyone insane. I get Janeway not wanting to get too involved, but it all felt really immoral especially since she knows how evil the government is. It's also awful that they leave behind Zio and Tom and Harry saying nothing about it beyond him being right about how the implants work. Voyager frustrates me because instead of having characters grapple with the immorality of their decisions (even if they're necessary) they seem to just have them ignore them. Not long ago I felt the same about the episode Tuvix. No one stood up for Tuvix. No one said this is wrong but we understand why Janeway has made this decision. They all just stood by silently. Ugh what is wrong with this crew? Get it together guys. 

So far I'm enjoying Voyager but I keep getting mad at their decisions more than any other Trek I've watched. The only exception is the Dear Doctor episode in Enterprise. That one makes me livid. 

Sorry if this was an incoherent mess. It's hard to type when I'm mad. 😂"
0,"I'm more of a casual fan, only watched the 3 trilogies, Solo, and the Mandalorian. As Luke Skywalker is supposed to end up on that weird island, what does he do with Grogu in that timespan?"
0,"I think George Lucas was upset when the fans hated Prequel Trilogy and blamed him for the failure. When Disney asked him to sell the rights to Star Wars, I think Lucas theorised that it would not be a good idea because, should the new Star Wars movie get bad reputation, then everyone would blame it on Disney and hate Disney for daring to buy Star Wars and ruin it. Meanwhile, George Lucas himself regained the love of SW fandom who even came to like Prequel Trilogy more because at least it was Lucas who made it.

So, I don't blame George Lucas for selling Star Wars to Disney. At least now, after Sequel Trilogy failed to satisfy fans, it is Disney who gets the blame and hate (Disney is basically Facebook of movie industry, it is big and popular yet everyone hates it and considers it evil) while Lucas is loved."

1,"For those who don’t remember, this is the episode where Kes is taken over by guy who turns out to be, well, a warlord.

Jennifer Lien did a really good job switching between the two characters and facing off against “herself”.

Also:
* An interesting sci-fi take on virtually the same concept as the character of Doro in the book *Wild Seed*
* Kes’ psychic powers, which so many episodes seem to forget
* The whole subplot going on with the wife
* Neelix actually garnering some respect by volunteering to fight for Kes
* Janeway flagrantly defying the Prime Directive to send her crew, including no less than her best pilot, into ground combat in support of a deposed hereditary monarch

The story is simple, but reasonable.

The one thing that didn’t sit well with me was the rightful ruler character choosing to stay on board Voyager, which was probably done for budget reasons. Though I could also see that Janeway might have suggested she wouldn’t let him come back after he left, and Voyager may have been strong enough to play literal kingmaker, so he may have decided that staying on board was worth more than rallying his people."

Since it's almost April and Germany is way behind with vaccinations, do you think that DST Germany is going to take place in June?

Also I'm new to Star Trek conventions, so I want to know... how does it work with Destination Star Trek conventions in Europe? Are London and Germany's conventions taking place the same year together every time? Do they switch (like one country at a time)? Is there a DST event every year, or are they \[for example\] every couple of years?   
If anyone could clear these things out to me, that would be great!

0,Just a heads up Im not sure if this belongs in this subreddit but anyways I think the sequel trilogy wouldve been alot more mysterious and interesting if it started off with the light being kinda the predominant power in the galaxy (like how return of the jedi ends) but instead of just seeing rey become a jedi it would be about the return of the sith like how we saw them in the old republic when there were sith academies and that stuff. We never really got to see the sith in the same position as the jedi were  we only really got to see the empire which was cool but it was mostly just pew pew soldiers no actual sith training. I think the sequel trilogy should start in the same peaceful bliss that rotj ended in with the jedi having returned etc and being able to see a clone wars type war between jedi and actual sith (like alot if them). Im probably wrong on a good chunck of the old republic stuff i talked about so sorry bout that please correct me if you feel like it. Also sorry if this read like a rant.

1,"One of the things I like about Star Trek is that you get see all sorts of bonds between the characters and I think they portray friendship really well in the series. Like, sure Tom and B’lana are a great couple and O’Brien and Keiko exist and Worf and Jadzia are goals, but there’s something so awesome about a good friendship. Romance is so much more variable and you can’t really mix a professional relationship with a romantic one, not to mention how many shit one-episode-romances there were. I’m nearing the end of s3 of TOS and you’ve got the bond between Kirk and McCoy that’s just classic, the bromance with Kirk and Spock that is at times downright hilarious (so many scenes could’ve ended with Spock deadpan saying ‘no homo’ and it would’ve fit right in lol). There’s Geordi and Data, Picard and Riker, O’Brien and Bashir, Harry and Tom, Tuvok and Janeway. And hell, they’d never want to admit it but Quark and Odo were secretly buds. Romance scenes to me are just meh at best and cringey at worst but a scene with two pals genuinely enjoying each other’s company and banter causes fuzzy feels every time. Am I the only one? What was your fave friendship in Star Trek? I’m kinda thinking Nog and Jake which I guess might not be everyone else’s but I just like the way they had their ups and downs and fell out but stayed friends, even when their families told them not to and everyone thought it was weird for a Ferengi and a human to get along so well. They helped each other out, got into trouble together and over time rubbed off on each other."

I've been a Trek fan since the 90s and couldn't really get into TOS. I put this largely down to the fact that TOS is one of the planks for sci fi tropes we are so immersed with today and so to go back to those old episodes feels quaint and unsophisticated. I feel that way about City.

But this original script? Wow, I'm blown away by it's attempts to reach for something much more profound than what we got. I totally get why we didn't get that version of the episode but it's given me a new appreciation for the struggles that network television must have faced in those days.

1,"Hi there. This is something I'm really wondering about, because I've never been much of a Star Trek person. When I was younger, Star Wars always appealed to me more and always felt more of an everyman type of story, in contrast to the enigmatic, intelligent and, as a result, elitist vibe Star Trek gave off. 

My only exposure to the IP is the first Chris Pine movie, and just now I watched a bit of Lower Decks. I don't have to be a Trekkie to know that these depictions are far off from the original films, series and such. They may be even border on that Dragonball Evolution territory, where this stuff is just Star Trek in name only. 

What do veteran fans think of these, and the sudden expansion of Star Trek as a whole? Is it good for the franchise to branch out like this, buffet-style? Or is it diluting the essence of what makes Star Trek what it is? I would love to hear from you guys!"

# Lana

&amp;#x200B;

 For a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. The Jedi were the champions of the Republic. While they were feared by some, many saw them as heroes. One of those was a little Mirialan girl. Her name was Lana and she lived above her family’s cantina. The world she had always known was located on the fringes of the Republic. Thus, she never found anything interesting about it. That is, until the day when she met a kind stranger. Correction: until the moment she realized that the hooded stranger was carrying a flashy cylinder strapped to his belt.

Lana checked that her mother wasn’t watching her, walked around the counter and jumped onto the seat in front of the stranger. Her small feet didn’t even touch the floor. The hooded human, who was sipping a hot beverage, held his cup midair as his eyes focused on the little green girl.

“Are you a Jedi?” she whispered.

Even through the shadows cast on his face by the hood, Lana could see the man had a faint smile. He put down his cup and Lana could see it was filled with a non-alcoholic blue drink. He took off the hood and leaned forward, supporting his elbows on the table. “What makes you say that?” He whispered back.

Her eyes pointed to his belt under the table. The man unclipped his weapon and placed it on top of a table. Lana’s purple eyes widened at the sight of the mythical object.

“Is that real? A real light sword?”

The man chuckled softly and held the saber in his hands at her eye level. “This is called a *lightsaber*. It is indeed the weapon of a Jedi”.

“If I have one, can I become a Jedi? Can I protect people with one?” she asked, this time not bothering to lower her voice.

“A lightsaber isn’t what makes me a Jedi. And you certainly don’t need one of these to help other people”. He pointed at her chest. “Something tells me that your heart will take care of that for you”.

Suddenly, an older Mirialan woman showed up from behind the Jedi and picked the girl up. “Lana, what are you doing? You’re late for school” she turned to the man. Her eyes hovered over the lightsaber for a while before saying. “I’m sorry for that. She likes speaking to the clients”.

The man smiled and the woman suddenly felt calm and not at all worried about her daughter talking with the stranger. “It’s okay. She’s a clever girl”.

“That she is…” the mother said softly.

The man clipped his lightsaber back on his belt and went back to his drink while little Lana kept telling her mother that she didn’t want to go to school.

After yet another horrible day, Lana came back to the cantina excited to see the Jedi again. But he wasn’t there. Realizing that he probably had other things to do, she did not let her hope fade and decided to wait for the next morning. But the stranger wasn’t there. In fact, he never appeared again. Lana had so many questions about the Jedi and the light… sabers, but there was no one to answer her queries. No one knew enough about the mysterious Order. An elder from the town was the only one who was able to tell her what the Force was… an energy that connected everything in the Universe – from small grains of sand to entire galaxies. Even more curious about the Jedi, she decided to become one. While the other children played and had fun together, Lana learned to take refuge in her own mind, by the power of meditation. However, whenever she tried to use her mind to control a simple rock, it didn’t move. Not even an inch.

Lana, as time went by, shifted her interests to engineering. Maybe one could only become a Jedi after crafting a lightsaber! That’s what she set herself to do. She used several parts, new and old, to build her own lightsaber, but, even after being finished, it never worked. Disappointed, she hid the ‘lightsaber’ inside a drawer and tried to forget about it.

Not that she could ever forget meeting that stranger man, but she was able to, at least, move on with her life. Her studies in engineering gave her the possibility of doing something else other than working at her parent’s cantina.

Even though the Republic was at peace, from peacekeeping duty to rescue missions, there was still much to be done in the galaxy. With that in mind, she enlisted in the Republic Defense Coalition and was sent to the *Emissary*\-class cruiser *Third Horizon*, commanded by Admiral Pevel Kronara. With her service, she met many Jedi, not unlike the one she had met years ago, but different. She even visited the *Starlight Beacon* before its dedication - all was perfect. That is, until they were called to the Hetzal system. Until the Great Disaster.

\*

Several Republic and Jedi ships coming from and going to the *Third Horizon* swarmed the sky while the Longbeam she was in, the *Beholder*, helped with the evacuation. They were not talking about a city, but an entire planet of forty billion people who were at risk. There, everyone was needed: Jedi or not. Her ship, which had been designed to be operated by a crew of three and carry a maximum of twenty four passengers, was now filled with evacuees. Once the ship was full, the doors closed and the captain’s voice sounded throughout the vessel. They were returning to the *Horizon* before coming back to pick even more people. Meanwhile, in the engine, Lana pushed her way through the crowd to go from one panel to the other. Until then, the ship had performed admirably considering the strain she was being put under. As the *Beholder* lifted off the ground, she felt it’s every shiver and decided to risk inputting more power to the engines so that it could handle better the gravity. Technically, Lana knew what she was doing, but no one had ever prepared her for that. A quick glance at the two pilots reminded herself that she was not the only one. They were all part of one big effort. After all, they were all the Republic.

They were on their seventh run, but there was still much to be done. Taking one breath, she looked out of the window and saw all the other ships. Then they received the order to abandon the system. A large container of tibanna was headed toward the system’s star. If it indeed collided with the star, it would be the end of everything in the system. They had to leave with everyone they had already loaded into the *Horizon*’s hangar. As they docked into the *Emissary*\-class ship, one last Vector abandoned the *Horizon*. She would later come to understand that Avar Kriss would be the last hope for Hetzal.

At the end of the day, almost everyone had lived. Lana simply went to her quarters. She had never been ready to work with so many *if*s before, especially with billions of lives under stake. Although she was afraid of doing it again, Hetzal was not her last trial of fire nor the Republic’s. The Hyperspace lockdown put in place by Supreme Chancellor Soh and the Battle of Kur brought even more strain to the relations within the Republic. At least, after the defeat of the Nihil, she was able to go back home and visit her parents.

After a cheerful family dinner, she went back to her room where she recalled her moments from childhood. Unintentionally, she opened the drawer where she had hid her ‘lightsaber’. She sat on her bed and held it in her hands like the Jedi had held his so long ago. That was the first time she cried after Hetzal. Maybe if she had been a Jedi, she would have saved more people. She could have helped steer the tibanna container off its course, or she could have helped protect the people from the raiders trying to get their way off planet at all cost - even if they had to kill innocents for it. Maybe she could have done so much more.

*So much more*, the words lingered inside her head. She was about to throw the lightsaber against her wall when her mother entered the room.

“You used to love that when you were a kid. You’d say you were going to become the greatest Jedi ever”. She then saw Lana’s face and walked closer. “You’re upset?” she asked. It was more of a statement than a question.

Lana gestured to the saber. “I could have done more. If only I had been a Jedi, I could have done more”.

Her mother smiled tenderly. She got down to one knee to be at Lana’s eye level and put her hands on her daughter’s shoulder. “Do you think the Jedi are gods?”

“No, but they have the Force”.

“No”. Her mother corrected. She didn’t know much about the Force or the Jedi. Everything she knew, Lana had taught her, “They can *use* the Force. The Force is all around us. *You* told me that. You have the Force too – You just didn’t need to tap into it to help those people”.

“If I could use it, I could have done more”.

“Or you could have done nothing”. Lana’s eyes rose to meet her mother’s. “When you joined the RDC, you wanted to make the difference. I told you to stay here, but you wanted more. You wanted to *help*. That wasn’t the Force telling you what to do. That wasn’t the stranger telling you what to do. That was *you*. *You* made that choice. If it wasn’t for that, there would have been one less person helping at Hetzal, and by the stars, everyone knows how much difference a person makes in those situations”.

Lana looked once more at the lightsaber and recalled the stranger’s words. They sounded more like a whisper now: “*A lightsaber isn’t what makes me a Jedi. And you certainly don’t need one of these to help other people. Something tells me that your heart will take care of that for you*”. She smiled. The stranger, *her* stranger, had been right. Her heart had led her to the RDC.

She was not a Jedi. She would never be one. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t help other people. That didn’t mean she couldn’t aspire to be the best version of herself."

However, even if that was the original plan, the Borg ended up being designed as their own unique species as opposed to just, the conspiracy alien, but in people.

What if it hadn't though? What if TNG stuck with the parasite people, but still followed a parallel course of events?

Hugh is an alien child who has an immunity to the Borg, but never noticed because he was raised as a meat-puppet from birth, and Picard is instead of debating using the boy as an instrument of Genocide by returning him as a bomb, debating whether to obey the Prime Directive and return the boy to the collective so his immunity can quietly spread through the collectives livestock.

6. Piccard's help was necessary to pull everything off, yet as stated earlier, him being there was a ""happenstance"". Not a great planning if you ask me."

In my eyes, he would be the maintain antagonist for the entire Sequel trilogy and is Palpatine does not return except as a manifestation of the Force. For my version of Snoke, I had to completely re-write his entire back story and even parts of the post-Endor era for him to better fit in the story.

Snoke is a lowly, yet devoted scholar devoid of any Force powers, he records and studies sith artefacts for His imperial majesty, Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant. He is sent across the galaxy scaring for any ancient sith objects that willing to help achieve his master's plan and same time Snoke becomes increasingly obsessed with the Force and its nature. Despite being non-Force sensitive he wonders if any of these sith holocrons or scrolls contain the ability to grant normal being access to the Force. When the death of Palpatine reaches Coruscant, Snoke wastes no time in gathering as many sith holocrons and artefacts as he can and flees the imperial capital and head out towards to Outer Rim. He meets up with an imperial fleet and used his skills of manipulation and position on Coruscant you to convince them to obey his orders. He uses the resources of this imperial fleet to explore sith ruins and old temples to uncover more knowledge of the sith.

However, as Snoke's knowledge grows, so does the strength of the newly established New Galactic Republic (yes slight name change) as Imperial forces facture. Snoke reluctantly follows his fleet into the Unknown Region along with many other rogue Imperial force, however, his knowledge of former temples and strongholds allows his group to find a suitable area to set up a new base. As any of the remaining imperial struggles to determine who to lead, Snoke uses the chaos to his advantage to build mistrust among the power grabbers. He gives that appearance of neutrality while encouraging others to murder their competition and he builds groups of loyal followers through his knowledge of the Force. As competitors dwindle, Snoke kills those who remain in his way and become the leaders of this rogue Imperial Remnant faction, proclaiming the First Order.

Over the decades Snoke discovers a ritual that could grant him what he desires but requires ritual be done on Korriband/Morband with the blood of one born of Force, thus begins his search to be sacrificed. While he searches for his sacrifice, Snoke also orders the kidnapping of Force-sensitive to create a loyal group of Force-sensitive enforcers, the Knights of Ren, much like the Imperial Inquisitors of Palpatine. While Snoke focuses on his projects, the First Order engages in mass militarization with new foundries and shipyards constructed.

While the First Orders has managed to build new ships like the Resurgent-class star destroyer (my version is smaller than canon one), they still rely on ageing Imperial II-class star destroyers, though they have been modernized the best they could. It is important to note that the First Order military is not a cable of the New Galactic Republic's military, but Snoke and First Order high command have taken this into account. The First Order is not the only Imperial Remnant group, in fact, some remnant factions have been legitimate governments with a thriving society, while others remain in disarray. The First Order plans to stark another war between the New Republic and other Imperial Remnant factions while they would take advantage of the chaos and Snoke could head to Korriband/Morband to perform the ritual.

So, what do you think so far?"
0,"I’m curious to know how accurate the list is. 

My criteria for this is I include Canon and Legends, unless some Legends characters have been proven to not be Canon in the movies (ex: Mara Jade, Jacen Solo). So if someone from Legends hasn’t been proven to be not real, then they qualify.

Like the title says, I was at an estate sale this past weekend and happened upon this interesting piece of Trek history. I didn't really know what it was at first, but after I got home I started researching a bit and it turned out to be a press kit for the very first season of the show. It includes 35mm color slides of the actors, headshots, and character bios/series descriptions. Really excited to share this with y'all!"

0,"In Episode I, Qui-Gon Jinn: (describing his encounter with Darth Maul) says: “My only conclusion... is that it was a Sith lord.”

To which Ki-Adi-Mundi replies: “Impossible! The Sith are extinct! They have been for nearly a millennium.”

Disney confirmed Acolyte is set 100-200 years before during High Republic era and will focus on the emergence of dark side powers, so how can there be sith acolyte in that timeframe?

Yoda was alive during this period so surely the council would know about a sith appearance 100 years ago.

Maybe the sith won’t reveal themselves in it?
Maybe it won’t feature sith, just dark side and/or jedi temptations?

Am I missing something?"
0,"We know a lot of Jedi died during the war, and because of thinning numbers the Jedi had to adapt to the war. I wonder if Kenobi, given his mannerisms and beliefs instilled by Qui-Gon, would have been considered for the council if the Jedi order was running the same as it had before the war? Or was his appointment a result of necessity due to thinning numbers and his success as a general more so than his success as a Jedi?"
1,"Before I begin the grilling on the state of civilization in PIC, let me acknowledge my top favorite civilization moments of the show:

* The exchange scientists on the Borg cube, the treaty and cooperation that apparently exists, the fact that Hugh is a science director to act as intermediate. That's all great.

* Starfleet Headquarter and Picard getting visitor badge.

* The scene where the Starfleet Admiral is convinced to issue diplomatic permits.

Now let's go through it in detail where civilization and the sense of civilization is failing or sabotaged by the show:

* Lack of police: At no point does it ever occur to Soji to call the police after people break into her apartment and ""kill"" her boyfriend. For now this can be justified by a fail-safe triggering that causes her to avoid police and seek Picard.

* Lack of police 2: Disruptor fire on Earth should trigger monitoring system/satellites similar to the Star Trek 6 scene and immediately beam down a security team or beam up civilians from the vicinity or cast a temporal/stasis field on the location or something. Might be explained by Romulan cloak/suppression field.

* Lack of medics: A simple knife wound in the chest could easily be fixed by emergency medics beaming in, or beaming the boyfriend to a med bay. Again no life sign monitoring systems triggered. And Soji does not call medics. Still might be the fail-safe, but now it's getting more icky, because there should be a life-preserving protocol, even if she wants to avoid authorities.

* Lack of civil society: Soji walks/beams/flies with a head wound to Picard. How did nobody see it, be concerned about her and offer her help, or call police/medics?

* Lack of police 3 / Lack of medics 2: When Picard sees her and at the latest when she tells her about a crime, Picard should call the police/security/medics. Now there is no easy fail-safe excuse anymore. But again the sense of ""we are alone in this"" is perpetrated by the show.

* Lack of ""fire-department"": The sole mentioning of ""Mars has been burning for 10 years"" is a) ridiculous and b) further intended to give the sense that problems can't be fixed, things are just broken, nobody is competent enough and it all just sucks.

* Lack of journalistic integrity and ethics: Fox News ""reporter"" ""interviewing"" Picard. She was completely unworthy of appearing in a Star Trek show and is clearly modeled after a talking-head hack doing ratings-bait-n-exploit.

* Lack of police 4: Soji is sensing assassins incoming in the middle of Starfleet Archives. No thought is given to emergency beam-out, or calling security or raising defense shields/system/triggering an alert. Instead ""you are on your own"" they just run to the roof.

* Lack of police 5 / Lack of medics 3: Explosion on the roof of Starfleet archives, show shows no investigation, follow-up, fall-out and doesn't even show the medics that supposedly bring Picard home, we are just supposed to guess what happens. Nobody asks Picard about his injuries or why he was there. Just Nothing. Just ""cut to bed"".

* Lack of security arrangement: Riker's home apparently has no civilization-level treaties, organizations or security forces to ensure the planet's safety as indicated by the mentioned raids going on and by the fact that he has to have a home-security system. Again there is ""nobody there"" and ""you have to rely on yourself because civilization has failed around you""

* Lack of Starfleet support: Picard doesn't get his minimal ship and crew.

* Lack of support network / treatment / post-scarcity: Raffi on drugs in a ""hovel"", complaining about a chateau.

* Lack of law: Seven can just murder somebody. No one cares. No investigation. No charge. No extradition. No governor or administrator calling anybody. No diplomatic incident. No trial. Complete break-down of civilization and post-apocalyptic Mad Max anarchy.

* Lack of law 2: Jurati can just murder somebody. Again there needs to be an investigation if only to find her incapable to stand trial because of impaired judgement from mind-meld rape.

* Lack of regard for Federation/Intergalactic science teams on the Borg cube: At some point they just disappear magically and nobody cares.

* Lack of Romulan authorities: At no point does the Romulan government/officials get involved in any of this.

* Lack of general morals, ethics, checks and balances and the state of law in Starfleet/Federation policy: Apparently the Federation has devolved into some sort of Stalinist dictatorship, where ""Black Flag Orders"" are on the books and the assassination of foreign dignitaries can just be ordered without questions or review and Starfleet Command can just remotely blow up Starfleet ships with all people (and children?) on board if orders are refused.

Conclusion: The show is laden with a sense of ""no civilization"" or a ""broken civilization"" or a ""failed civilization"". Which is the antithesis of Star Trek, because Star Trek is about a utopian civilization."

1,"Hey friends! Welcome to the discussion thread of the second (third) episode of Star Trek: Enterprise.

“Wait, what? Did I miss anything? Why now?” That’s what you may be asking yourself. Okay, here’s the deal: 

[Link to the discussion thread of the Pilot, Episode 1&amp;2, “Broken Bow”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/lecfvf/star_trek_enterprise_season_1_episode_1_broken/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Now that any new Star Trek is on a break again, I went back to my very first Star Trek show, the one that pulled me in. I know I’m a bit of a rarity here with that, but I began with watching Star Trek: Enterprise first. I loved the premise and really liked the crew, and it pulled me in. Next I watched Voyager, and then TNG and finally DS9. I also watched a few episodes of TOS, but couldn’t really get into it. I’ll try again soon. I love how each show is fairly distinct and unique. While I think DS9 is the best show with the best characters (followed very very closely by TNG), ENT has a special place in my heart. I recently began watching it again and somehow wondered what this sub would say in the weekly discussion thread about each episode. And since the new shows are currently on a break, I figured I’d ask you guys to watch the show with me. 

So join me. Watch ENT with me from the beginning and discuss it here. 

The rules for this will be the same as for the official weekly discussion thread for any new shows on here, with one addition: if you watch quicker than we do, or if you already know the show, do not spoil anything that doesn’t happen up to the current episode. 
Now, I’m not a mod. I can’t enforce this, but I trust you’ll be good sports for this, okay? 

Since I am not a mod, this won’t be stickied, so I don’t know if it makes sense to wait a week between posts. I think I’ll post on Saturdays and on Wednesdays, so twice a week. I hope that’s okay for everyone. You can follow me and check my posts if you like, so you can always find the last post. 

Maybe this’ll just die in new and just not happen, but if you decide to come along, enjoy the ride :) 

The next thread for episode 4 will be posted on Saturday.

0,"Was Porkins name simply lazy character writing or the original script had the backstory already in place?

Either they got a chubby actor and decided let's name this guy in red squadron 'Porkins' haha how funny. Or Porkins was already defined and casting intentionally found a heavyset actor for the role.

I'm completely new to Star Wars, so basically, what I'm asking is, did the media ever know of any of this? Like did they ever speculate on it, and so did fans, and Carrie/Harrison/Mark deny it, or, nobody knew a single thing, and there was never speculation until she revealed it?

It's sorta interesting how fans can pick up on chemistry with co-stars, and see if they actually did or not, but I always thought none of them did, so it was surprising when Carrie revealed yes."

-Has won two Klingon political disputes, including one in the highest court of Klingon culture.

-He had gained respect from some of the higher ups in Klingon society, including the Klingon Chancellor

-Was married to one of the most important Klingon women in the Klingon Empire

-Survived numerous battles

-Acted a Saboteur, Soldier, and Politician

-Was at one point the leader of a species, and had many positions of power before and after at some point

-Was friends and an ally to the people responsible for saving the entire Alpha Quadrant

-Saved the leader of his own species, twice.

-He survived Empok Nor with his gang of Ferengis and managed to rescue his mom Ishka from the Dominion.

-He's more or less been a civilian in all of this and had only one day of military training.

-Out debated a Vulcan on Logic

-prevented the sales of WMD's that would have been used to kill tens of millions of people.

-Successfully argued against Alien Gods and won, they who were going to de-evolve him after having done the same to his leader.

For starters, Reed is far too whiny to feel like the chief of security. Several of the more Reed focused episodes are hard to watch (the one where he and trip are kidnapped on Risa and where he and trip are stranded in a shuttle are especially bad despite the latter being a great concept with a really strong performance by Trip). Them meeting the generational enterprise from the future and learning that Reed died alone was the most realistic thing on the whole show. Despite all of this, the worst part about him is that his inferiority complex actively got in the way several times in regards to the MACOs legitimately trying their best to just do their actual jobs.

I feel like I like Enterprise more than most but Reed is the one thing about the show that really brings it down in my eyes."

0,"don't get me wrong. i love Star Wars Rebels, but i think that the story could have been better.

Ezra is a decent main character. but his journey feels hollow, something already done again and again.

he was more interesting at the start of season 1, when he was a selfish and cynical thief that grow up in the streets of Lothal or during his ""Darkside phase"" in season 3.

Ezra becoming a selfless hero make his character boring and generic. we already have plenty of young and heroic jedi (Luke for exemple). there is no need for another one.

the best parts of Star Wars Rebels (Ahsoka vs Vader, Maul vs Obi-Wan, everything involving Thrawn, Kanan development) are not even focused on him. Ezra is simply a bystander, and interesting events happen araound him.

for me Star Wars Rebels should have been a direct sequel to Star Wars the Clone Wars, with Ahsoka as the main character.

we could have seen the continuation of her journey and how she become Fulcrum, how she helped creating the Rebellion, how she adapted to her new life in a galaxy ruled by the Empire, how she evaded the Imperial Inquisition.

outside of Star Wars the Clone Wars, Ahsoka is an underused character. she make mostly cameos in other shows to hype the audience and make fanservice. she deserve her own series."

So all 3 of them, Luke, Leia, and Ezra, should have the *same exact birthday*. Why are people saying otherwise? And is my logic wrong?

Edit: My new understanding, thanks in part and whole to u/TLM86, is that the Empire was formed during the night (after Mace is defeated). Obi-Wan asks Padme the next day about where Anakin is, and then the two big duels happen into the night. The children are born the next day."
1,"Because lifeforms in other galaxies won’t be DNA based and won’t originate from an Earthly common ancestor, they will look nothing like Earth life. There is absolutely no chance that other lifeforms developed similar features to us because the same evolutionary pressures did not occur on other planets. Even the shape of our bodies is totally dependent on the literal atmospheric pressure of this planet. Other lifeforms may just be floating blobs if every for all we know. Good job Gene!"

0,"The stakes were completely different. 

Obi-Wan and Yoda went into hiding because they didn’t really have any other choice. When the Jedi Order fell in 19BBY, the Empire was already in control over most of the Galaxy (thanks to the clones) and the Rebel Alliance wouldn’t be formed until only a few years prior to ANH (2BBY going by The Force Unleashed in Legends continuity). For those 17 years, the only active rebels were small uprisings and rebellions on local planets (which the clone journalist in Battlefront 2 implied was easy work for the Empire). The Imperial Senate was basically a joke, with most senators either loyal to or too afraid of the Empire to do anything. Most of the Galaxy’s population either resented the Jedi for the Clone Wars and/or were too afraid to do anything either. The few allies the Jedi still had (Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Garm Bel Iblis) were being watched under the Empire’s microscope and had to be extremely careful to not give the Empire an excuse to permanently silence them. Just a mere rumor or suspicion that the two were working with or in contact with the senators would have painted giant targets on all their heads. 

Not to mention Vader spent all that time hunting down any and all Jedi survivors and the two were extremely high on the Empire’s wanted list. Yoda’s species was so rare that the mere mention of a “little green man” on any planet would draw in the Empire (TFU2’s databank revealed that they had an ever-increasing bounty on him), so he had to go into seclusion. Obi-Wan had to watch over Luke and keep him safe from both the Empire and the dangers of Tatooine, since he knew Luke would one day need to learn the ways of the Force. As far as he knew, he and Yoda were the last of the Jedi and they had to preserve it.

Now compare that to Luke’s reason. He basically had EVERY reason to stay in the game! Yes, his Jedi Order was dead, but the New Republic was in power, Snoke and the First Order were in hiding, and he was still regarded as a war hero and a legend. Even with no other Jedi, he would have been a huge benefit to the New Republic and the Resistance due to his powers, his tactical (not to mention piloting) skills, and his reputation. I mean, Lando was able to rally the Galaxy to fight a fleet of Death Stars, so imagine what Luke could have done *much* earlier! Plus, unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, he *had* friends and family who were still alive and could have benefited from him being there! Not to mention, he had access to info in his sacred Jedi texts that would have come in handy *long* before TROS! He had every reason to come out of hiding before the events of TLJ, but he didn’t.

Honestly, thinking back on it, I realize just how easy Snoke and the First Order had it when compared to Palpatine and the Empire. They didn’t have to start a war in order to gain power and they didn’t have a full-fledged Jedi Order to worry about. Honestly, it feels like everything was just handed to them."

 To take a life for medical knowledge and then to discard that information invalidates the life that was lost.   


 Mankind is barbaric, and the show ignores the fact that humans tended to abuse our brothers to further said research, yet boldly takes the high ground as says we only used animals? Ignoring what hitler did to the jews, and what the south did to the blacks?  


 To use such information in research dose not condone how it was maid, all its use dose, is give some small measure of acknowledgment to the life that was lost, to toss it away, means that those that died, died for nothing."

Then I started DS9 and it's great! The characters seem kind of like real people and I enjoy what's being done. I'm still on season 1 so it could get worse, but I'm really liking what I've seen so far.

If you've given up on TNG in the past, I recommend trying DS9 instead, it's much better!"

I'm looking for items that weren't confirmed, so things such as the Boba vs. Cad Bane arc, or the Utapau arc while awesome storieswe know would have come. But before other stories, like what Ahsoka was doing after leaving, Anakin in the months leading up to his turn, what the fates of clones such as Rex would have been, because remember, until Rebels we had 0 clue whether Ahsoka, Rex, and Maul would have even survived. The show was starting to tease that line with Order 66 and it's clear they had more seasons planned then what we got with season 7.

0,"In the Phantom Menace, Anakin was believed to be the chosen one and after some pod racing and winning he was set free. But let's imagine if Watto took his place. Since he was the slave owner of Shmee and Anakin he wouldn't have had to due pod racing. Anakin and Schmee would have went with him since they are his slaves. After some negotiations with the Jedi Counsel, Watto would be forced to set them free and begin his training as a Jedi along with Anakin after the events of The Phantom Menace. 

Fast forward to Attack of The Clones, Schmee wouldn't have died and on Tatooine, therefore Anakin would have never fallen to the Dark Side. As for Watto, he would more than likely join Sideous, Assaja Ventress, and Dooku because of his love for gambling and greedy nature. He would be with Dooku throughout the Clone Wars up until Dooku died in Revenge of The Sith."

0,"Alright feel free to instantly downvote me, it's cool. I'm a big boy, I can take it. But if you aren't gonna crucify me just yet, I can explain what I mean.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/jedipadawantrey/status/1381762083914706947?s=19) has been making the rounds for the past day or so and has been negatively received due to its implication that self proclaimed SW fans who dont know smaller details in SW aren't real fans.i believe that's wrong. There isn't a test out there that you need to pass to be accepted as a real fan but there is some truth to it as he mentions characters like Rey, Ben, and Grogu.

There are nine main characters in Star Wars' OT. And whether it's a retcon or not, every ""new"" character mentioned in the tweet is *directly* related to at least one of those nine. Kylo is a Skywalker/Solo(/Organa?) and Rey is a Palpatine. And up until Ahsoka was introduced into the story of the Mandalorian, we all called Grogu Baby Yoda.

So while I dont think ""real"" star wars fans exist because they know the info in every nook and cranny in the galaxy, I do think these characters should have been truly new and not descendants of existing ones. It makes gatekeeping easy and forces the new fan to watch all the old stuff if they dont feel accepted when we should just make new stuff. I mean could you imagine if Grogu looked like a baby version of a much less popular jedi with less distinguishing features and less screen time?(Ki-adi, Coleman Trebor) And having to force Mandorian fans to watch the old stuff just to get the reference which is now more of an inside joke? 

Alright rant over but all I'm saying is that what his tweet tells me is that ~~world~~ galaxy building doesnt work and it makes the SW universe seem like a small town when you do it like that. Making everyone related and throwing the same nine characters into every story is alienating more people than its uniting.

TL;DR: gatekeeping bad but easy to do when ""new"" stories involve several descendants of old characters. Stop fanservice and create new stories"

2. Do you think Anakin would kill Ahsoka if she was at the Jedi Temple during Revenge of the Sith?
3. If Ahsoka killed Anakin in the events of Twilight of the Apprentice (I think she could have if she had struck his life support console on his chest instead), how do you think she would deal with the guilt?

My answers:

1. I think it is. Learning that your older brother (she refers to him as her older brother in the Ahsoka walkabout arc) went that evil justifies that.
2. I don't think Anakin would have, but if he had, I think he would feel deep sorrow for what he had done.
3. I think Ahsoka would see it as liberating Anakin from Vader, not killing Anakin."

""Please not again""

I'm a new fan. Only started watching TOS on Netflix for first time late last year, previously had only ever caught the tribbles episode and the episode with the blob creature thing in the mine with the silicone eggs on tv. Now seen them again obviously in full context.

Get to the point. ""Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise"" (looks like Ryan Gosling) may be one of the.. well in my opinion THE most under-appreciated character of TOS. But I dunno' I'm new to Star Trek so for all I know the fans give him big love.. but just from watching the show, and he's only in two episodes.. that's a shame. The guy was comedy gold in his first episode, freaking hilarious.. and then his second episode is so far the other way, delving deep into his tragic childhood and his thirst for vengeance. Such a great character for just two episodes.. &gt;!I was so relieved when he did not die in his second episode, as I felt like he might. !&lt;

Anyway the often light heartedness, occasional hilarity of this show really surprised me. I knew so little about Star Trek before, I did not realise it was such a funny show at times. Like in season 3 ""I'm tweedle-dee he's tweedle dum"" ""two spacemen marching to a drum""... that made me laugh so much, and McCoy watching, looking both freaked out and inappropriately amused. That scene was unnerving and creepy but also hilarious at the same time.

But nearing half way through season 3 (still not yet finished), still my most remembered line of dialogue is ""now ONE, MORE, TIME!"".. and since then whenever I'm going to do something again the line comes into my head, like ""aw heck I forgot something I gotta' get back up ONE, MORE, TIME!"" ... ""please not again"".

Love it."

1,"Many weeks ago, the following casting breakdowns were released for SNW:

cast breakdowns are available for *Strange New Worlds*.

&gt;**Yeboah**. She’s Black, in her early 20s, and fresh out of the academy. She’s a linguistics genius, bright, promising, and the youngest member of the crew and she can sound “American” or have any other accent.  

&gt;**La’an**. She’s in her late 20s – early 30s and is the head of Security. She’s badass, physical, and suffers from PTSD. She has an air of vigilance and precision. They’d specifically like someone who is East Indian, Asian, or Middle Eastern, but are open to any ethnicity.  

&gt;**Ortegas**. She’s in her late 20’s, Latinx, and an experienced vet. She has kept a dry wit even with the combat she’s seen. She’s smart, funny, competitive, and is able to pivot from handling a gun to making a joke.  

&gt;**Biodun**. The ship’s doctor is a close advisor to Captain Pike, has an air of “easy erudition”, is male, Black, in his 40s, and curiously, “from the original series”.  

&gt;**Miller**. Biodun’s nurse, she’s in her late 20s – early 30s, Caucasian, heroic, charming, free-thinking, and “the beating heart” of sickbay.

Today, Paramount / CBS announced that:
&gt;Babs Olusanmokun (“Black Mirror,” “Dune”), Christina Chong (“Tom and Jerry,” “Black Mirror”), Celia Rose Gooding (“Jagged Little Pill”), Jess Bush (“Skinford,” “Les Norton”) and Melissa Navia (“Dietland,” “Billions”) will join as series regulars. 

Putting it all together yields [this](https://imgur.com/d0vqWwk).

In my mind, that leaves three questions:
*Is Ortegas Operations or Engineering?
*Who is Biodun from TOS? (As previously discussed, M'Benga wouldn't make a ton of sense.)
*Is Yeboah actually meant to be Uhura?

That's all folks."

0,"I don't know if this was already pointed out somewhere, maybe I've seen it and it laid dormant on my memory until now (if so, my bad), but anyway.

Recently I talked to a friend about the whole thing of Skywalkers having their hand cut off and I thought it'd be fitting if Rey had something like that (or perhaps creating her own path in spite of her genes/family). But anyway, I thought about this whole thing of Skywalkers getting their hand cut off (by a powerful Sith) and it being sort of a ""baptism"" for a Skywalker, meaning they are, through that hardship, becoming a ""true Skywalker"", or at least a powerful, consagrated, true jedi. Let's go over each dismemberment:

* In AOTC, Anakin gets his hand cut off by a powerful Sith (Dooku). Between that and ROTS he becomes a Jedi Knight and one of (if not the most) powerful Jedi of that time.

* In ESB, Luke gets his hand cut off by a powerful Sith (Vader). Between that and ROTJ he trains with Yoda and becomes a very powerful Jedi (since most are dead, possibly the most powerful).

But in ROTJ, during the climatic fight in the ending, Luke gives into his anger and cuts off Vader's hand. At that exact moment, Luke is the Sith and Vader is the Jedi, and to me that signifies the exact moment where Vader turns to the light side and becomes redeemed again (Vader betrays the Emperor on the very next scene), and Luke is at a crossroads.

Again, not sure if this is obvious or just me thinking too much about it, but it's something I'd like to share."

Additionally, the Kzin had had many skirmishes with klingons. However, they only ever encountered the aftermath of klingon ships when the artificial gravity had already failed. Klingon blood appears bright pink in 0G, for some reason (but reverts to looking much like human blood under full gravity).

Since the Kzin pretty much only ever saw bright pink klingon blood (and possibly some bright purple venous blood under the same circumstances), they deliberately made their spacesuits what they thought of as “klingon blood red” to strike fear into all their foes for being badass enough to appear covered in the blood of a proud warrior species."

In my opinion Star Trek Voyager is the best part of the Star Trek saga since TOS.

In this part of the Star Trek saga you can see a new species and civilization of the unexplored quadrant of the galaxy. You will see the first contact with specie 8472 and their bio-ships. You will see the ultimate battle vs the borg queen.

1,"For All Mankind is a show on Apple TV+ created by Ron D. Moore who was a prolific Star Trek writer. It’s set in an alternate reality where the Soviet Union beat us to the moon, so the space race continued far beyond where we stopped in our reality.

It’s increasingly becoming the Star Trek show I’ve always wanted. Before ENT, it’s about how hard it is for humans to be good, but how great an opportunity space presents for the whole human race. It can be soapy at times, but it’s also got some absolutely bad ass moments. And the end of this second season (airing next Friday) is promising to be absolutely epic.

1,"I've just started watching TOS. I put off watching it for a long time because I always thought it will be like Star Wars and I didn't particularly care about Star Wars that much. They were okay, but they were in no shape or form the amazing films and series the fanbases make them out to be, for me. Also, the movies with Chris Pine didn't do anything much for me. I've had the same reaction to most pop things in geek and nerd culture. In fact, my default position of 'nerds always overhype. It can't be that good' held up pretty well. Until started watching TOS that is. Star Trek to me is above and beyond the wildest praise that has been laid on it. The way the narrative stretches, the concepts. It's everything I want in a series.  This is one of the few series where the story is the protagonist and the actors are the tools. Star Wars, Marvel, DC and what have you all revolve around a person or a group of people. Star Trek, so aptly named, is the stories and boy am I here for it. Why aren't you folks as rabid about Star Trek as other fanbases are? I could've got to watching it long before if you were. But this is a good thing, I guess.

Darth Maul is the #1 bad guy in the Star Wars universe. Let's leave the clone war series stuff out of this &amp; focus on just his apperance in Phantom Menace. Based off just what happened in that film, we can say Darth Maul is the reason for Vader.

Darth Maul kills Qui-Gonn, making Obi wan to take on Anakin as a apprentice before Obi wan himself is even ready. If Darth Maul had never killed Qui-Gonn, Qui-Gonn would have been able to train Anakin himself &amp; Anakin never would have turned into Vader. Boom, Maul is the ultimate bad guy."

1,"I like Landru from The Return of the Archons so much that I named my Betta fish after him.  Unlike Skynet he doesn't try to have the people exterminated, unlike the Matrix he doesn't turn the people into batteries, and unlike Vaal he allows people to live semi-normal lives and even allows them to exert their energies during the Festival at the Red Hour.  Yes, people can be hurt but that could happen in normal circumstances as well.  Yes, people seem to be mind wiped when first taken into the body, but once in they seem to gradually develop their own personalities again.     

Recently in my 8th grade class we were studying dystopian societies in preparation to read The Giver and I showed this episode as part of that.  It was well received with most liking with only a couple who had a hard time understanding it. 

If my review of The Return of the Archons you can do so here: [https://jeremysstartrekreviews.blogspot.com/2020/01/a-computers-idea-of-perfect-humaniod.html](https://jeremysstartrekreviews.blogspot.com/2020/01/a-computers-idea-of-perfect-humaniod.html)"

1,"Overall I really liked the season. I wouldn’t say it was as good as Season 2, but it did feel a bit more like classic Trek. Burnhams character growth was done well and I liked the end when the Admiral basically told her the time has come for her to take the chair. I liked that there was no double crossing. It’s become so commonplace on TV that I was waiting for the Admiral or Book to turn against them. The Burn mystery seemed a little “small time” for a season long story. More the kind of thing that could be wrapped up in a 45 minute episode. That said, the growth of the crew was clearly the focus as opposed to the problem they were trying to solve. Looking forward to seeing Burnham as Captain and think the politics of the Federation rebuilding will make for a good backdrop in Season 4. Hopefully we get more Trek by the end of the year. The Pike show sounds really good."
0,been rewatching the Star Wars movies lately and I’m curious as to why the Clones are so much better than storm troopers? aren’t they the exact same thing just working for different organizations in time? the clones were able to kill practically all the Jedi while storm troopers seem pretty mindless. was it because Order 66 was so unexpected? any thoughts?
1,"One thing that seems recurrent when ive seen Star trek fans in media or on youtube, is that the fans seem to know the names of episodes.

1,"So I guess [SPOILERS] for any who haven't yet seen it. I had watched this once before but it was years ago.

This is the episode where the Enterprise discovers that Data is lying after apparently traveling through a wormhole which he says knocked everyone else unconscious for 30 seconds. The crew realize that they were actually out for over a day, and discover that the xenophobic aliens' technology stuns the crews of ships while making it appear as if a wormhole knocks them off course while putting them in a 'biochemical stasis'. 

My question is that they say the stasis is the reason why, for example, their beards haven't grown. But earlier in the episode Crusher does a 'transporter trace analysis' in which she compares biological data from the last person to go through the transporter before the missing period of time with their current levels. She finds out that their cells show that a day has passed based on the daily/circadian rhythm, and that the divergence is of at least a day. 

How is that not mutually exclusive with having been in biochemical stasis for that day?"

Paramount plus has just been released so I think something similar should take place, and what better way than to remaster one of the best Trek shows. With this all in mind and how narratively DS9 fits into todays streaming landscape better than TNG or TOS then why shouldn't it. I really wonder what you guys think it would take for them to finally remaster this classic."

1,"How Kai Winn got to the positions that she did makes no sense from their religious positions. She should have never been able to even make it to Vedic, let alone become Kai. My reasoning:

she had never gotten a vision until the pah-raiths. In ds9 it seems to be made pretty clear that the orbs give people visions most of the time when they interact with them. The prophets specifically decide (I’m assuming multiple times) to not talk to her. To me, and I would assume the other religious leaders as well, that would be a pretty good indicator that she wasn’t a good person."

Pandora, the cold and stoic leader of the group, Cinder, a hot-headed flame trooper in training that burns first and asks questions later, and she is Pandora’s second in command, Bayou, a go-with-the-flow marksman, Shank, the melee weapon master which loves to crack jokes at every turn, leading to many things going wrong in the heat of battle, Crypto, a calm and collected foot soldier, and finally Requiem a deep and brooding sand trooper.

1,In the three episode arc at the beginning of season two of deep space nine the circle tries to take over bajor and kick the fedeartion out of deep space nine.  They were idiots.  Whether the cardassians were involved and whether they were supplying weapons to the circle is irrelevant.  Because even if they weren't behind the circle they would take over bajor and deep space nine as soon as the federation leaves.  The circle would have to know this.  They would have to know that even if the cardassians weren't supporting them they were damn sure take advantage of the federation leaving.  And take over bajor again.  Or were they really all clueless idiots?

Just food for thought."
1,"I've seen a lot of people complain about &gt;!Picard's death and return in a ""golem android body"".!&lt; I know I'm very late to posting a discussion post about this, but I guess the beauty of Trek is after 55 years we can still find things to discuss and debate. Anyway:

**I don't hate the fact that it happened, I hate that they're 100% not going to use that to the story's advantage going forward.**

When I think of pre-TNG movie Picard and how he would deal with this situation I imagine him asking these kind of questions:

* ""Have you taken into account the implications of what you have done to me? You have just found a cure for death. How many countless millions of lives could be saved using this method, but will not get the chance? Don't they to deserve a second chance at life?""
* ""If you had to program my new body to eventually die then that stands to reason that without it I might live a very, very long life. What right do you have to determine loosely when I will die? Have you fully considered the ramifications that you can now create a being, even an entire race of beings and tell their bodies when to give up on them, essentially commiting genocide disguised as 'natural causes'?""
* ""Who gave you the right to bring me back? I was fully prepared to take my last breath, a truly unique part of the human experience. Now that has been robbed of me, not by medical science, but by removing my body from the equation entirely. Also, how is my current 'consciousness' real and not simply a recreation, a forgery of the memories and experiences of Jean-Luc Picard?""

But, of course, none of these very rational, very thought provoking, deeply concerning and very Trek-like questions will be raised or explored in the slightest because *Star Trek: Picard* is a Pew-Pew show.

I'm really hoping I'm proved wrong and *Picard* Season 2 gives us an insightful look at mortality, identity and gives us the ""character study of Picard"" that we were promised. Guess I'll just have to make do with ""flesh and blood androids"" (sooo... humans? Just humans that haven't come out of a womb and are technological despite having no technology in them? *sigh*), a whole lotta punching and kicking, Seven of Nine in name only, R E F E R E N C E S, and cameos because the producers know that I'm a simp for all things TNG. Oh well."
1,"TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT - to me these 5 shows ARE Star Trek, especially the middle 3.

There's a few qualities these shows had that are sorely missing in new Star Trek:

* Optimism/Tone! Nether Discovery and Picard have any of the optimism, hope, or utopian vision of the future synonymous with Trek. They've become grey and gritty like every other sci-fi.
* Episodes! These shows are more akin to a 10 hour movie than a tv show. Episodes don't have beginning, middles, and ends. You can drop in and watch any episode of Voyager or TNG, and pretty much every time the mystery or problem is resolved by the end - you don't need to know what happened the prior 5 episodes.
* Pacing! Star Trek is slow and methodical; scientific. The new shows are like rollercoasters in comparison.

The fans ask over and over for more Star Trek, so why can't the studios just make more Star Trek?

Why does it have to be ""Star Trek, but mass appeal! It's Star Trek, but for everyone!"" Why do they feel the need to this? Star Trek was never mass appeal, but it had a huge and devoted fanbase that just wanted more content. Why can't they just do this?

Am I alone in this mindset?

Live long, and prosper."
1,"First of all, I realize I may have had a few too many Andorian Ales tonight, but in my opinion. Commander Shran is the best guest character across all of the Star Trek series.  Yes, I do realize this includes Jeffrey Combs' other amazing character, Weyoun, Brunt (and a variety of other guest appearances he has made), and also Dukat, Gowron, Martok (can you tell I really like DS9 yet?), and how can I not forget, Q!

I know that I am dropping the infamous ""Khan"", but to be honest, I haven't see the TOS movies (or series, for that matter) in a long dang time, so forgive me.

In my opinion, Commander Shran, of the Andorian Imperial Guard, is the best (and my personal favorite) guest character across all Star Trek series.  

Oh how I wish that they had continued Star Trek Enterprise.  I know it has been mentioned on this subreddit many other times, but had STE been greenlit for a season 5, Commander Shran was to become another main cast member/character in the series according to Manny Coto.  

Okay, fellow Star Trek fans out there, prove me wrong!  There are no wrong answers, by the way, since Star Trek is freaking awesome and I will likely agree with all of your opinions on the matter, but for right now, Commander Shran is the BEST!"

Show Pitch #1

TV series set in the Kelvin Timeline.

Would showcase the events after Star Trek Beyond and would follow the Khitomer Accords being jump started early as a result of Admiral Marcus’ meddling in STID.

Show Pitch #2

TV series set in the Kelvin Timeline.

Set in the years between the destruction of the USS Kelvin and would showcase the development of the USS Enterprise and help explain why it looks so different to the TOS Enterprise

Show Pitch #3

TV series set in the Kelvin Timeline.

Would basically be the Kelvin timeline version of TNG.

Would follow Picard on the Enterprise D and how different everything is this far into the altered timeline.

Show Pitch #4

TV series set in the Prime timeline would follow the crew of the USS Opportunity (*the first ship capable of Warp Nine*) and would begin very soon after the end of Star Trek: Enterprise characters like Archer and Pike would make appearances."

Hey, I am a big TCW fan since my childhood, I watched it many times and  still do. I wanted to do this watchlist that focuses on clones. I'd suggest this list to anyone who hasn't seen TCW and is mainly interested  in it because of the clones, but also to veterans that want to spice up their rewatch. May contain weird formatting issues.

I tried keeping it  as chronologically consistent as possible, but I took some liberties to  make for a more exciting watch. My rule here was that nothing should  interfere chronologically, that certain episodes don't mess up previous  ones. On the other hand, if two episodes can live on their own and don't  reference each other (and the characters in it), I took the liberty two  put them out of chronological order if I wanted to. The only real  chronological character inconsistency is that Assaj Ventress will appear  for a few seconds in ""Rookies"", and will then later on be introduced in  ""Hidden Enemy"". But as this list is about clones, Assaj won't really  have a big role anyway, so I decided that this was okay. You'll also see Numa on Boils and Waxers helmets on Geonosis before they even met her, but that's not a big thing either. I split up some  arcs and didn't finish others to keep the topic ""clones"" relevant,  you'd have to rely on the introduction summary of each episode.

I'll explain my reasoning for this list below.

**CLONES (Watchlist):**

(ca. 11h)

**411** Missing in Action

**301** Clone Cadets

**105** Rookies

**205** Landing at Point Rain

**116** Hidden Enemy

**210** The Deserter

**302** ARC Troopers

**318** The Citadel

**319** Counter Attack

**320** Citadel Rescue

**120** Innocents of Ryloth

**407** Darkness on Umbara

**408** The General

**409** Plan of Dissent

**410** Carnage of Krell

**601** The Unknown

**602** Conspiracy

**603** Fugitive

**604** Orders

**701** The Bad Batch

**702** A Distant Echo

**703** On the Wings of Keeradaks

**704** Unfinished Business

**709** Old Friends not Forgotten

**710** The Phantom Apprentice

**711** Shattered

**712** Victory and Death

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Episodes  I considered to include, with a short explanation why. Many of them  have some clone elements to them and/or some clone action, but the  clones aren't the driving force of that episodes or the major part of  the story doesn't focus on them. That's why I decided not to include them.

**101** Ambush | Yoda talking about how different each clone is in the force

**102** Rising Malevolence | ""Not to me""

**113** Jedi Crash | Bond between Rex and Anakin, also talking about the necessity of the war

**114** Defenders of Peace | Same as above, also strong connection between Commander Bly and Aayla Secura

**115** Trespass | &gt;Rex

**208** Brain Invaders | Order 66 foreshadowing, resolution of Geonosis plot + many clones

**220** Death Trap | Young clone perspective, clones as brothers vs. Boba ""the outsider""

**606** Crisis at Heart | Commander Thorn, allegiance to the Republic

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**If you haven't watched TCW, spoiler warning for all 7 seasons.**

Explanation of my watchlist (long):

I started of very irregularly with **""Missing in Action""**.  My reasoning behind this is, that I think this episode is a great  introduction to what clones are and could be. The viewer has to go and take the same journey as Gregor, learning to know what a clone is and  what it means to serve for the GAR.

**""Clone cadets""** and **""rookies""**  are a no brainer. Introduction to Domino squad, Kamino, mindset of the  clones and their individualism. Also introduction to Rex and Cody, and  how important clones are for the republic.

**""Landing at Point Rain""**  as a single episode may sound weird, but I decided to include it  because I wanted the viewer to not only see what the clones did and how  they behaved with each other, but also how they really helped the  republic and the jedi, and that they can take the lead. Cody holds a briefing of the attack at the beginning and commands while Obi-Wan is injured. We also see Rex, Jet and a full out war. Geonosis is obviously also a callback to AOTC.

Now that we established what clones are, how they behave and their importance and  loyality to the republic, I wanted to shatter that POV to show  that  not everyone thinks clones should be bread for war and fight for the  republic until they die. That's why I included **""Hidden Enemy""** and **""The Deserteur""**. Interesting philosophical concepts on what the purpose of the clones really is and should be.

**""Arc troopers""**  is action packed, has a special meaning for the clones as it is their  home world, Echo and Fives get promoted to ARCs (also 99, rip). The **citadel arc**  isn't ABOUT the clones, but they do play a major part on the side of  the republic, and it inforces their reliability. Also, Echos death.

Next one may seem kind of weird too. I put a single episode of the Ryloth arc (**""Innocents of Ryloth""**),  because this episode is about Waxer and Boil (to some extent Cody). We rarely see the 212th but in this episode we see some personalities being developed, and how the ""clone wars"" affect innocents.

The reason I put the Innocents of Ryloth arc right before the **Umbara arc**, may make sense now. This arc obviously focuses a lot on clones and  their role in the galaxy, being one of the greatest arcs in the entire  series. Due to the fact we just learned about Waxer, his death will probably play an even bigger role.

I won't say much to the last arcs. They are all in order and are fine as  they are. The big inhibitor chip arc leading to Fives death, the rescue  of Echo and the mention of ""deformed clones"" vs. ""regs"". The siege of  Mandalore is obviosuly one of the greatest arcs of the entire series,  also with focus on the bond between the clones and Ahsoka Tano, specifically Rex's bond with her and the fact that Maul slowly puts together the bigger picture on what the role of the clones is in this  war. Then Order 66 and Rex, no brainer.

The story, the execution, the moral dilemmas, action, special effects, but MOST importantly the acting of Kate Mulgrew, Robert Beltran and John Rhys Davies is 10/10. Such a gripping first episode in the arc, followed by part 2 and The Gift where Jeri Ryan’s portrayal of a Borg who is then ripped away from everything she knows for a 2nd time is just incredible. Brings a tear to my eye every time..."

0,"Their strong connection to the Galactic Senate and the Supreme Chancellor is their greatest flaw. The other reason they fell to the new Sith Empire is because of Mace Windu. Had he not been so extremely devoted to the Jedi Order that he'd kill Darth Sidious (because he *is* a Sith Lord), Order 66 would probably *never* have been allowed to fly under the watchful eye of the Senate. Mace Windu was an extremist and because of that, he sealed the Jedi Order's fate. Some Jedi were lucky to have survived that massacre and go into hiding until the time was right."
0,"I rewatched recently. I know audiences at the time it was released were completely surprised by the Father Reveal, but in hindsight, the entire movie builds to that reveal. 

It starts right off the bat with the crawl that says Vader is obsessed with finding Luke. That's Vader's motive and every single thing he does further's that goal. What's interesting is it's never stated WHY he's so obsessed (until the end), just that he is and all the troops have to do what he says. 

This obsession feeds into the pursuit plot with Han and Leia. I mean he commits a vast fleet to chasing one ship through a dangerous asteroid belt, losing a lot of resources in the process, all because he's obsessed with finding Luke. 

Then there's the conversation with the Emperor, in which Vader tips his hand a little. The Emperor tells him ""we have a new enemy"" implying that the Emperor just found out about Luke and is telling Vader, who clearly already knew and didn't tell the Emperor. Then the Emperor implies they need to kill Luke and Vader is like ""Yeah, I hear you, but, just to take it another direction, what if we turn him to the dark side instead?"" Again, in hindsight, we see that Vader is not only obsessed, but also wants Luke alive, a subtle clue that feeds the reveal. 

On Luke's side of things, his training with Yoda is also telling as Yoda keeps focusing on controlling fear and aggression, being patient. Little kid me use to find these scenes boring, but it's clear now that Yoda is trying to impress on Luke the dangers of the dark side so Luke doesn't end up like Vader (his father). The cave sequence also feeds into this lesson. 

I think the reason audiences were taken off guard is because it didn't feel like there was an actual mystery these clues were feeding into. You only really notice them after you know what they lead to. I think it surprised people that a pulpy space adventure actually had some depth to it. It's my favorite SW film because I keep finding things to unpack in it. 

Anyway, thank you for coming to my TedTalk."

0,"*This takes place as Rey is on Ahch-To, trying to convince Luke to train her.*

**Luke:** I sense a power in you, Rey. It’s strong. Too strong.

**Rey:** How can a power be too strong?

**Luke:** My father’s purpose was to bring balance to the force. That’s no ordinary Jedi. They don’t come in troves. Powerful Jedi like that are rare. Once in a thousand millennia rare. And yet here you are.

**Rey:** Anakin Skywalker.

**Luke:** Yes.

**Rey:** I’m to bring balance back to the force, like he did?

**Luke:** That’s what I fear. But it doesn’t make sense. He was the chosen one.

**Rey:** So there *is* unbalance. I felt it. So what’s causing it? What’s pulling the force to the dark?

*Luke looks at Rey.*

**Luke:** Ben.

**Rey:** But I’ve seen Ben. I’ve seen his mind. He doesn’t have that power. He’s not evil. He’s lost, like me. He needs someone to guide him.

**Luke:** Rey, I trained students for decades at the Academy. Not all of them were good. Many had darkness inside of them. But they were dealt with. They were trained, or exiled, or made to forget about their powers. Ben was the one student who I couldn’t help. He found his calling within Snoke - some force sensitive being who came from nowhere.

**Rey:** If the force is so strong, then maybe he didn’t come from nowhere. Maybe the force was never truly balanced.

**Luke:** Then my father would have failed.

**Rey:** Forgive me, Master Luke, but if you sense a power within me so strong, then maybe this isn’t your fight at all. Maybe you were never destined to help Ben. Maybe that task was never going to be possible. 

**Luke:** What are you saying?

**Rey:** If what you’re sensing is true, and I am to bring balance back to the force - to to deal with Ben Solo - to defeat Snoke - then I need to be trained by a Jedi. And you’re the only one left.

**Luke:** Rey-

**Rey:** It doesn’t have to be for the Jedi order. That’s not what matters now. We just need peace. Whether the galaxy needs Luke Skywalker is irrelevant - *I* need him. And so does Ben.

*Luke shakes his head in disbelief. There is a pause.*

**Obi-Wan:** She’s right.

*They both turn to look at Obi-Wan, who has appeared as a Force Ghost.*

**Luke:** Ben-

**Obi-Wan:** I trained your father, Luke. He was seduced by the dark side of the force. I blamed myself for years. It wasn’t until I became one with the force that I truly understood that it wasn’t my fight at all. It was your father’s. I was simply his Master. Luke, you are the Master now. And Rey (*He turns to her*) - don’t you think for one second that Luke is the last Jedi.

**Luke:** But what about my father? What about the prophecy of The Chosen One?

**Obi-Wan:** Anakin’s balance still rests. It’s under threat, of course, as it always shall be - but it’s not gone. It is the duty of the Jedi Guardians to preserve Anakin’s balance now.

*Luke looks at Rey. Obi-Wan notices.*

**Obi-Wan:** Ah (*He chuckles*), now you understand. Then my work here is done.

*Obi-Wan fades.*

**Luke:** Tomorrow, at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi."

0,"Hey fellow Star Wars fans,

We all know George Lucas. He is like a god when it comes to pop culture. Now don't hate me but, As much as I love Star Wars, I don't like him as a person. Hear me out before you downvote.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt he never liked the fans and interacting with them. I feel that he looks down upon us instead of embracing the millions and billions of people who love his stories. I've heard numerous stories about how rude he is to the fans and he's one of the worst celebs to meet in person.

 Also, the obvious, He won't release a GOOD version of the theatrical OT. He's ruined the hopes and dreams of millions. I wish he was (when he still owned LucasFilm) more like Kevin Feige who embraces the fandom. I love what George has given us and he's made my live so much better but I wish he was more embracing towards fans.

Please tell me what your opinion is on this. I would love to know what everyone else thinks."
1,"I've only watched TOS, TNG, and DS9 so I don't know a lot. But through 2 seasons, I remember hearing that Harry Kim is an ensign. 

But he's always in the important board meetings with the other main characters. Hence the senior staff meetings. But I dont recall an ensign ever being in the senior staff. Always assumed it was because it's not a high enough rank. 

Does he specialize in one job that's very important? Did he get promoted at some point that I missed so far? Thanks!"
1,"In the DS9 episode The Circle Part 2 (S02E02) at about 39:20, Sisko asks for Admiral Chakotay at Starfleet Command. Does Voyager's Chakotay have a relative  high in the ranks at Starfleet command? How many Chakotays can there be? Something that made me wonder."
1,"Sorry if this isn’t an original idea, but it’s been rattling around in my head for a long time; and perhaps by sharing it here (and getting feedback) I can get it out of my head. 
Namely, the issue of how to detect cloaked ships. Now, we know that you can’t see a cloaked ship; and we know that scanners can’t detect them. However, they’re still “there”—they’re not incorporeal. 
So, in situations where we’re dealing with espionage or combat (that is, weapons range), why not flood the area with things that will hit and bounce off of the Klingon or Romulan ships? Something like a 24th Century machine gun. Heck, spread the area with machine gun-like devices attached to replicators that just blanket the area with flying metal. Then, track to see what they bounce off of. 
Perhaps even some kind of dust particles that could be motivated to move and flow around the ships they hit. 
I know this would kill the dramatic tension, “Captain...the Romulans could be anywhere—nope, never mind, found them.” but it seems like a straightforward approach. 
Please share your thoughts."

1,I was watching Voyager last night when the crew teams up with the Borg to fight Species 8472. When Tuvok left the bridge to head to the transporter room to transport over to the Borg cube to join Cpt Janeway it raised a question in my mind I'd had for a long time. Why don't they just transport crew members from where ever they are on the ship directly to their destination? They have the technology to make point to point transports without a transporter pad as we see them do it regularly from away missions to sick bay or space to the cargo bay. I mean they could even transport from the bridge to the transporter room and then to their destination? All that walking from various parts of the ship to the transporter room seems less efficient and a waste of time when the technology doesn't really demand it. Just wondered if anyone had ever heard an explanation of why the transporter pad is so preferred.
1,"Love Star Trek, all the series/films, lore, and even fan podcast dramas.

The enact evasive maneuvers and jump to warp. *Right* after they jump to warp, Nog asks Jake to send a transmission to DS9, to which Jake responds ""They must be jamming our coms.."" My question is, how could coms be jammed in a ship in warp by ships that aren't in warp in the same direction? This may be a silly question, just curious. Also my first reddit post!

1,"I see a lot of posts here in which people are sad because they have finished all seasons of a show and they are saddened that there is no more episode for them to see. I have a solution for that:

Don't watch all of them! It might sound like heresy to some but this is the fastest way I found to enjoy the story as efficiently as possible: in Star Trek seasons, many of the episodes are inconsequential, and 2 seconds of reading a quick synopsis (on Netflix for instance) is enough to get an idea of whether the episode has meaningful consequences. Skipping some of the filler episodes not only lets you advance faster in the story, but also leaves dozens of episodes you can watch for the first time after you've reached the end! 

You might think that there is a risk of either not understanding the story or missing a critical pivoting point in the story, but so far I haven't regretted any of it. All the episodes I skipped and watched later did end up being pretty inconsequential or of lesser-than-average quality, but it's very satisfying to get extra episodes to watch! The most important episodes are usually the two-parters so they're pretty easy to identify anyway. One who has seen the show could even create a list of skippable episodes and make it available to people like me who are in a rush to catch up with the story!"

The prequels have an insanely deep story with familiar and relevant characters to the overall story George Lucas set up. While the sequels may be better made, the characters and story are absolutely useless and add nothing of value to the franchise. They were just made by disney to appeal to kids and the casual star wars fan.

1,"I'm probably all wet on this one, but damn, it's so out of place and unnecessary. They got the 2 parter ending in the prior episodes. It was a fitting ending. It showed the beginnings of the Federation and you got the best acting performance of Tucker in the whole show. I almost teared up at the end when he was crying to tpol. 

Then they stick us with a 1-part ending when they decommission Enterprise... it's so bizarre. Riker and Troi show up for no apparent reason. They added nothing to the show except to contrast TNG with Ent. And contrast there was. Riker talking to the crew as the chef really showed how forced and hamfisted the actors of Ent really were. Riker was fluid and effortless, his cadence was fluid and spot on. Compared to the crew who just felt forced.

Then the story is just generic as fook. They brought back Shran, because everyone loves Jeffrey Combs- I have no complaints here about that-. You have Archer butting in again on an away mission, 'I wouldn't let you have all the fun!' yeah, no shit Scott Bakula, you do everything in the show. He literally has his hands in everything interesting or important. Give the spotlight to someone else for a change.

Then they kill Tucker for no reason, like, why was that necessary? It felt so hamfisted. They had a perfect ending previously leaving tpol and tucker's relationship ambiguous. Then they just deus ex machina in and say, 'ha-ha, all that sexual and emotional tension, all that psychic shit, the baby they cried over, and nothing happens between them and nothing will, Tucker dies.' What kind of bullshit is that?

It makes me almost think Bakula had something to do with it. Like he wanted Tucker to die so he couldn't get his own spinoff show and upstage him, because, lets be honest, Tucker upstaged the fuck out of Bakula at every turn.

Then, my favorite part is when you have the three captains of the enterprise reading the tagline, 'these are the voyages...' You have Picard who's voice and cadence is just so damn good. He's like Morgan Freeman, his voice is like the voice of god. Then you get Shatner who's an absolute icon. Very 1960's alpha male. Then finally Bakula who's just an absolute goober. I wonder how many takes they did of that and if they intentionally used the worst take, because he sounds so out of place.

I can't help but wonder, with how bizarre and out of place the ending was, were they trying to make a statement, ""Don't remember us by Ent, remember us by TNG or TOS?"""

0,"It could be before, during or after Lando. What is interesting is not only the great view and panoramaes, but that it is a micro universe in itself. Instead of travelling all over the galaxy or all over a planet in every episode, one could have everything happening in a large city. Which would look big enough when we follow the daily life of the characters living there.   
In Battlestar Galactica, much of the action happened inside the main ship, and in many of the older Star Trek series, entire episodes could happen inside Enterprise. Or Babylon 5.  
I don't mind these smaller scale concepts from time to time, existing next to the large scale shows.  


And they wouldnt' need to stay in the city every episode. There is a whole gas giant to explore. Maybe other man- or alien made objects arrives, or some large floating organismes exists in the deeper layers. And just like there are coral reefs on earth, made up of countless smaller organisms, maybe there could be flarge gas filled ""reefs"", like floating islands.  
Also, there are always visitiors from space arriving the city. For someone who wants to go a little further away, the planet has more than one moon. From one of theese moons, the gias giant would probably fill most of the sky."

1,"Between Enterprise and TOS seems like the objective worst place to put it.

Why not do what TNG did, and set it in the distant future?

&gt;!Yes, yes, in Season 3 they do time travel to the distant future. But that doesn't resolve all the cannon crap that could've been avoided!&lt;

That would solve all the continuity issues (like why Voyager couldn't use the Spore Drive to get home) and even most of the aesthetic gripes (it makes sense that starships look way more advanced in the future, providing a logical excuse for ever-improving CGI technologies) The visuals in Discovery are phenomenal, but the ret-conned Enterprise was a terrible idea.

It just seems like setting the show in the distant future from the outset is a better idea.

Any thoughts on why they didn't choose the obvious course of action?"

0,"Star Wars and the Original Trilogy never set up any themes that would suggest this.  

The way Obi Wan initially describes them is more descriptive of a late Knights Templar.  Powerful Religious / Military organization with no direct ties to a government working hand in hand with the Republic to do good throughout the galaxy.

Their destruction at the hands of Vader also would bring in ""Rout of the Templar"" vibes where the government turns on them because they are too powerful and influential. 

I think turning the Jedi into a monastic order crippled the wide variety of storytelling opportunities that could have existed in legends and in canon content now having to wedge every ""Good Guy"" into the same mold and then figure out how to have them branch out of that mold without ""Falling to the dark side"" 

It worked when there were a handful of jedi to talk about but with the universe expanding more and more rapidly the jedi are completely hamstrung story wise and the sith and bad guys will be our only strong outlet for creativity in force users. 

It makes the only defining characteristics of the Jedi how they break from the order's teachings rather than allowing their personalities and styles to help tell the story. 

The theme is very repetitive and it turns the wow factor of exploring different eras and Jedi storys into ""meh"" because the jedi you see in one era are the same jedi you see in the previous.  It's always a ""I don't believe the way i was taught... but oh no the dark side... let me reconcile it"" over and over.  That is great for like 2 characters.  not for ALL of the characters they try to explore from the Jedi eras.

And the jedi that stand up as ""TRUE FAITHFUL JEDI"" are the most bland of all.  yes you're a white shining flawless superhero.  How creative. 

This is why our best characters are either fallen jedi, former Jedi or Rebellion/Post Imperial Jedi

Because they leave the Monk aspect behind. 

Anyway that's my critique.  Have a great day."
0,"I’m a huge fan of the OT and the Prequels, but I still like the Sequel trilogy. I think there’s a lot of potential there if they had just fixed a few things. 

1. Don’t abandon Finn as a character. I would’ve loved to see both him and Rey become Jedi, to lead the new Order into the future together. Seeing an ex-Stormtrooper become a Jedi and lead a rebellion against the First Order would’ve been incredible, instead of just shoving him off to the side. 

2. Just let Leia die in the opening sequence of TLJ, when she gets blasted out of the ship. We could have a moment, say goodbye to her, then move on with the new characters. It also allows Kylo to fully cement his turn to the Dark Side, and establish him as the clear number 2 big bad for the rest of the trilogy.

3. It’s a minor thing, but the hyperspace skipping at the beginning of RoS always bothered me. Hyperspace jumps are shown in universe to require incredibly complex calculations with little margin for error. Doing them randomly is like playing Russian Roulette with 5 bullets instead of 1."

1,"So I've been watching some documentaries about hypothetical alien invasions, including Curiosity's ""Alien Invasion: Are We Ready?"" and checking out movies like The 5th Wave and Independence Day, etc.  The common theme here is that you've got an entire civilization that's packed up onto a single giant mothership, or ark, for a very long journey across space to a suitable planet for them to settle, after some slight redecorating of course.  To be clear, this is a pre-warp civilization.

I thought, wouldn't it be interesting if the were an episode where the Enterprise or the Discovery or the Defiant encountered an ark ship like that? (Was there such an episode?  I can't remember.)  Maybe on this ship the entire species is in stasis, or a small crew on the graveyard shift.  Either way, it's been on course for a particular Class-M planet for thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of years, but now that planet is a Federation member world.

How does the Federation starship deal with the situation?  It's a pre-warp civilization, so where does the Prime Directive fit in?  They probably wouldn't want to just destroy it, and even if they did it wouldn't be too easy as the ship would be incredibly armored just to survive the journey across realspace at sublight speeds.

I can see a lot of potential plotlines here.  They have to stop the ark ship from unleashing destruction on the Federation world, but not at the cost of wiping out the pre-warp species."

I have two weeks off of work and I want to for the first time go through the entire timeline pretty much non stop.

I could see them in the writers room going ""ok, whats the absolute darkest shit we can have our badass security officer overcome"". ding ding ding! ""RAPE GANGS!"" - uuuhh.. oof I think they overshot it a little bit... Would love to know the ideas before they settled on rape gangs... like the ""Heroin Cannibals"" or something but it just wasn't brutal enough"

1,So I have been all over the place on my opinion with the disco klingons but I have come to the conclusion that there pretty good. There different armour design combined with heavy prosthetics truly makes the klingons in discovery a fine addition to the series truly something alien in the Star Trek series.
1,"For the few ones left who aren't aware of TNG's 6x15 ""Tapestry"", Picard dies at the start of the episode due to a heart attack and is being greeted by Q, who offers him to bring him back to a key moment in time. Picard was involved in a fight with a couple of Nausicaans and was stabbed through the heart. He survived, but needed an artificial heart ever since. The whole incident shaped his character in a significant way, but will still ultimately lead to his untimely death, as seen in the opening teaser.   


Picard indeed acts different now, avoiding the fight by shoving his friend before the situation escalates. Picard finds himself alive back in the present on the Enterprise, but has to realize he's just a mere junior Lieutenant now, being an assistant astrophysics officer. Q explains that's exactly what happened in the new timeline. Picard played it safe during that moment and it shaped his character forever. Unsatisfied with such a life, Picard asks Q to bring him back once again to be stabbed, rather living a satisfying life and dying prematurely instead of living a life full of insignificance. Q grants the request and the episode ends with Picard surviving the heart attack after all and him and Riker unsure about all of that being just a dream or another test by Q.   


And now we got the Picard Season 2 Teaser, with the biggest reveal of course is Q being back, the omnipotent being capable of basically everything except wooing Janeway. Picard narrates with the key sentence being *""what we do in a crisis often weighs upon us less heavily then what we wished we had done, what could have been.""*, followed by an hourglass with a reversed flow. What's more, the clock in the beginning shows 10:04, which in my book is an obvious reference to Back to the Future. 10:04 PM was the time a lightning bolt hit the Hill Valley Courthouse, providing the energy to sent Marty back to..., well, the future.   


So my theory is that season 2 will be a whole Tapestry on its own. The teaser featured the bajoran tablet from DS9 ""The Reckoning"". Picard was fond of Bajor and its people and was also a strong proponent of them joining the Federation. One of the biggest indirect influences he had on them was being transformed into Locutus, destroying the USS Saratoga and killing Jennifer Sisko, which ultimately led to Benjamin Sisko being assigned to Bajor. What if one of the biggest regrets of Picard was to not have acted differently during Best of Both Worlds? Not getting captured and therefor possibly the initial plan of firing with the main deflector dish working? Sisko's life would have been drastically different, as would have been Bajor's history in those seven years. 

Focusing on the Stargazer might refer to Jack Crusher being killed during an away mission in 2353, something which had to do with a ""life and death decision""."

1,"He tells me what to do, and what not to do. He is the voice of my conscience. 

This temporary effect happens when I watch VOY. After some episodes, especially the ones where Tuvok is prominent, my inner dialogue turns Vulcan in his voice.

“It would be advisable to get some rest now. Put the blunt down and brush your teeth. Tomorrow will be a challenging day.” That sort of thing. 

I don’t mind. He’s much more sensible than me and looks out for my best interest. I get the same effect from Picard in TNG and from Spock in TOS too. I guess I just trust them to guide me and respect their wisdom.

On one planet you can find a blend of species just chillin but I don’t see any equipment to help them adjust to the environment. Each planet has a different gravitational pull, different air quality, but the most preparation I see is coats on a snow planet. Has the republic figured out some way to make every planet the same in these regards? Or are the beings of this time just so much more advanced physically that the can just handle it? But then if they went to a planet with less gravitational pull the Jedi could even more cool flips and stuff? Anyway I haven’t been able to sleep because I cannot stop thinking about this."

They can outlive any human. Grogu is 50 years old right?
And when Luke came ang got Grogu to train him, who will take after luke when he cannot train Grogu anymore?
Seen in the latest Star Wars movies, Luke in older age has many human children that he trains to be Jedi.
So who takes Grogu from Luke? 
Yoda himself i believe to be dead at this point, and Luke looked very young when taking Grogu. 
So is it really Luke that is going to train him?"

1,"What if archer was depressed about the things he did in the expanse and got wasted.  A few minutes later they end up in a battle with the klingons.

What if kirk was sleeping with a dozen alien women and alcohol was involved and he got totally wasted.  So much so that he could barely stand.  Then the klingons or gorn show up and fire on the enterprise.

What if picard made too much wine and tried to drink it and was totally wasted as the borg tried to assimilate the enterprise.

What if sisko was depressed that starfleet was losing the war with the dominion and climbed into a bottle.  And when the jem'hadar ambushed the defiant was so wasted he didn't know where he was.

What if janeway was so depressed about stranding her crew in the delta quadrant that she got wasted and then the borg showed up.  And she was too wasted to give orders that made sense.

As for discovery and picard I don't like them most of the time so use your imagination.  As for lower decks I can see the whole crew being wasted during a crisis and not just the captain.  So what would happen if the captain of a ship was wasted during a crisis.  I think that would be something that would be interesting to see.  Let me know what you think in the comments."
1,"Let's say you are in the Star Trek future on earth and want to acquire something that could not be replicated (today done with: amazon, ebay, alibaba).

We know that there would not be companies that work to make a profit, but there still should be some kind of platforms to orgize these services, right?

So if you were to design a platform like amazon, Uber, linkedIn, airbnb, etc. under Star Trek condition, what would you do different from today's companies? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start:

for Star Trek ""amazon"" I would pick the new name ""mall"". Instead of the star rating system, I would also let items that are sold on the platform be expert checked and rated. Mall would not exploit their workers and not manipulating people to buy stuff that they don't really need."

1,"I was watching ""Gambit"" recently.  In this episode Data is given command of the Enterprise while Riker and Picard are away on the mercenary ship.  Worf disrespects Data's command by questioning his orders in front of the crew.  I remembered that Data's command was also questioned in Redemption by Lt. Cmdr. Hobson.  It got me thinking that Data's long experience in Starfleet should at least give him some credibility as a leader.  We can assume Hobson has never worked with Data, so perhaps we can cut him some slack, but one could assume that Data's reputation would probably be known.  And Worf?  Sure he's never been XO, but he should definitely know better.  But overall, I just think Data deserved better."

0,"Ok, so hear me out. Apparently the duel of the fates track we love so much has a symbolic meaning. Essentially, the song played when Qui Gon and Maul were fighting. It was a duel of the fates because it literally was going to decide Anakin’s fate. If Qui Gon won, Anakin would have had Qui Gon as a mentor, a person who was a father figure and who knew the importance of love and attachment and the deeper Jedi truths. Thus, Anakin would have been trained well in a style that actually suited him. 

If Qui Gon lost, then Obi Wan would teach Anakin. While Obi wan was also a good Jedi, he did not have the same fatherly presence as Qui Gon, and did not believe in the importance of attachment. He was prone to follow the rules of the Jedi rather than the essence. So, Anakin consistently internalized his pain.

So that’s why the song is called Duel of the Fates. Amazing to think they thought of this stuff back then as well."

0,"The only content I’ve seen on this are Star Wars mag writers and none of their reordered versions seemed to make much sense to me. I’m wondering what you guys think the new best way to watch the movies is. If I **had** to make a new version, I would do this:

1. TROS

2. Rogue One

3. ANH

4. ESB

5. AOTC

6. ROTS

7. ROTJ

This sacrifices the sequels from being about their own characters and stories to basically an action packed opening to the other films. It adds more tension because the audience will presume Palpatine is a bigger threat knowing he had survived. People experience the redemption in episode 6 knowing what ultimately happens and thus the importance becomes less about their legacy on the galaxy and more of a story about a father and son. It also probably helps Luke’s arc remain more consistent with the character you see in the OT. Solo I left out as I feel like Han is not important enough to the story to have his own background movie, especially leaving out episode 7 and 8. Phantom menace is left out as per the original Machete Orders reasoning.

I’d be happy to hear why my ideas suck and your own order to watch in now that differs from the original machete order since we have five more films. Maybe even an order that rearranges everything to be about the sequels. I’m making this post because I want their to be a new consensus of sorts for the new order to watch the films in a machete cut that differs from chronologically released or the chronological timeline."
1,"Space Seed is a great episode any way you look at it. However I do wish it was bit longer and it would have done a lot of good to make it into a two part episode. The episode we do have builds and builds.  It introduces Khan ,it has him interact with the rest of the crew, and ultimately his take over of the ship.  However once it seems he has 'won' he loses pretty quick.  Kirk is able to retake the Enterprise in almost no time at all.  It would have been better to end on a cliff hanger than have an entire episode about retaking the ship.  I would have done the Khan character more justice, fortunately we have the movie to sort that out later.

1,"After Data had created Lal – “The Offspring” (TNG 3:16) – he worked to establish themselves as a family, with him as her father and her as his daughter. It has always seemed a little odd to me that one of his first steps wasn’t to adopt a family name for them.  It would have been very “human” of them, which was always one of his goals.

Since he is consistently described as a Soong-type android, I think using Soong as his family name would have been perfectly logical. Data considered Noonian Soong to be his father, Juliana Tainer-Soong to be his mother, and Arik Soong his ancestor. Taking the same name, as Lt Cdr Data Soong, and calling his child Lal Soong, would have just made sense to me."

At 16 years to go for Voyager and still being in Borg space, the Dominion War still happening, and Borg vessels already in the Alpha quadrant, it doesn't seem wrong that the Borg would have also been (with regard to non-linear expansion) in the Gamma quadrant as its next door neighbor, and Borg are still going to do what Borg do. There were Borg Cardassians and Bajorans and no doubt the Borg knew of the wormhole as the transwarp hub was not destroyed until years after the discovery of the wormhole."

It would take them three years to get to federation space.  Unless they had faster warp technology.  And lets say they have a lot of ships.  Say ten thousand ships.  How would that fight go down?

Does anyone know of any of the novels that would be good for younger kids? Her reading comprehension is well above her grade level, like 8-10 is fine.

0,"I’ve always loved the concept of grey Jedi. I think having individuals who add this moral ambiguity into the world makes it much more interesting than the black-and-white of light vs dark, or Jedi vs Sith. And I know a lot of people dislike the concept. Even the Star Wars team says that they can’t exist. But I think this is the wrong decision. I think that there can be so many interesting stories about grey Jedi, and can prolong the franchise by adding fresh, unique stories. Lots of people say that since the dark side is inherently corruptive, grey Jedi can’t exist, but I disagree. The dark side can still corrupt if you give in to hatred and selfishness, but can you not just use it a bit, only being angry some of the time without fully falling to the Dark? Does that mean that everyone who gets angry, or sad, or feels fear is automatically part of the dark side and is doomed to fall? I think this whole argument is ignoring basic morality and storytelling, and I’m really upset that we won’t be able to see these concepts explored in the future"

1,"Hello everyone! I only got into Star Trek within the last year or so with the intention of watching Picard with my mom. I finished TNG and was dreading the moment it finally ended, simply because I enjoyed so much. Within the last week I started DS9 and am only 12 episodes into season 1. Gotta say, I absolutely love it so far. Honestly, it feels a lot like a western, anyone else feel that way? Point is, I have been thinking about some really memorable episodes I’ve seen that I think about regularly. I think about TNG: Inner light at least once a month or more. What episodes do any of you think about on a regular basis? Favorite or just really memorable? Any series works! I want to keep track of these for future reference. I totally intend on watching everything!"

0,"So I was thinking about Princess Leia and some weird things came up in regards to her story that I haven’t been able to explain.

First: why is she called a princess? Was Bail the king/prince of Alderaan? Or was it her adopted mother? If it was the former, weird that it was never brought up, but if it was the latter, that brings up even more questions.

Luke asks Leia in return of the Jedi “what do you know about your mother”, and Leia replies something like “not much, but I remember she was sad.” We’re led to believe this is Luke’s mother as well, this is padme. Now, obviously that doesn’t make any sense, considering Leia was a newborn the only time she saw her mother. However, that also means that Leia either doesn’t consider her adoptive mother her “real mother”, which would be weird, or that she didn’t have an adoptive mother at all, meaning that either she always knew she was not really an organa or that the “queen” of Alderaan died when Leia was very young, and that’s who Leia was referring to. Which would be even more weird. 

Another one I had is why no one refers to Leia as the queen of Alderaan after Alderaan destruction. Presumably, leias parent or parents, the alderaanian monarch, died when it was destroyed. So wouldn’t that make Leia the new queen? 

Or, and this is even more crazy: does everyone consider Leia a princess because her mother, her actual mother, was a queen at one point in her life? Does everyone know, including Leia, that leias mom is padme? Do they know the father? 

My last question is, it seems kinda weird that Leia never brings up Alderaan again, considering that presumably all her family and friends lived there and her life was lived there and it was all obliterated. You’d think that’d really screw somebody up. But Leia seems unaffected by it, even shortly after it was destroyed. Why is that?"

I'm in my early 30's and never seen StarTrek. I consider myself a big star wars fan but in all these years I've never look or learn anything about this movies, I only know some stuff like spok from the big bang theory. 

With my wife, we just started to watch old and classic movies from the 90's (I really don't know when StarTrek was released but seems old too) and I think Star Trek saga could be a good option for this lockdown time.

I ask for your help on how we should see this movies, recommended order, series, etc

Thanks!

Edit: thanks for all your responses !! I never thought I'll get this amount of comments !

Seems like there is maaaany material to watch, I think I'm going to skip the original series (because it's really old ) but do watch the first movies, then move some series!

PD: I had no idea it started with a tv show and that there is more than one ""generation""

0,"So, I was recently playing Pandemic's Star Wars: The Clone Wars on PlayStation 2, and I've come across a interesting question. Now, I know the game isn't really considered Canon, but it's the only source material I can find that shows the moments leading up to the Battle of Geonosis. In Attack of the Clones, it seemed as if the Jedi strike team lead by Mace Windu had gone to Geonosis while Yoda went to Kamino. It never felt like they showed up to Geonosis at the same time as it shows in this game. Judging by the reactions of Padmé and everyone else in Petranaki arena, when the LAAT/i gunships and Acclamator-class Assault ships showed up, this was right when they descended into Geonosis' atmosphere. At least that's how it felt in the movie. So my question is: Did the Jedi strike team and the GAR along with Yoda all arrive on Geonosis at the same time? Did the assault ships wait in orbit while Mace Windu and Luminara Unduli cleared an LZ? Or did the Jedi strike team arrive before Yoda and the Clone Army and the Clone Army just so happen to arrive conveniently at the right time? I can't find any other source material other than this game that shows these events. Thank you. [Star Wars: The Clone Wars](https://youtu.be/jQ7A_q1BIBw)"

But George Lucas included the character to confirm that Vader really is Luke’s father.

Darth Vader suspiciously claims this to be true in The Empire Strikes Back.

However, Lucas consulted with a child psychologist prior to making Return of the Jedi.

The psychologist said children age twelve and under would dismiss Vader's claim as a lie, unless it was unequivocally stated that Vader was, in fact, Luke's father.

Lucas determined Yoda would be the best character to confirm this truth."

1,"I was surprised to read that VOYAGER isn’t well-liked here. I’ve enjoyed every second of it so far (I’m on season 5), and there are days where I’ll watch the show the entire day. VOYAGER has gotten even better with the introduction of Seven of Nine (my favorite TREK character thus far after Janeway).

TNG was my first TREK experience, and it took me a year to watch the entire show. I enjoyed it immensely and I was hesitant to start VOYAGER because I thought there’s no way it could compare to TNG or to Picard himself. Now, VOYAGER is my favorite TREK series and Janeway is my favorite Captain (Picard feels too perfect in comparison). It’s taken me less than two months to get to the fifth season, and I’m sure it will take me less than two weeks to finish the entire series, which makes me really sad. I’m already thinking about an immediate rewatch. 

Sure, the show is wacky, but I love it. I’ve even warmed up to Neelix. The only weak point for me is B’Elanna, who is incredibly annoying. I can’t wait to watch PICARD after I’m done with VOYAGER, especially for Seven of Nine. 

(Also, Kate Mulgrew’s character in ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK was my absolute favorite as well before I even knew she was in TREK—I really need to watch more of her work. She’s such a great actress and there’s something warm about her.)"
1,"So I've been a Trekkie since the 11 year old me stayed up to watch Encounter at Farpoint.  TNG ended when I was in high school and DS9 was on while I was in college, and though I thought I had seen them all yesterday while thumbing through a Trek site I ran across pictures of a little runabout floating around DS9... I thought it was fan fiction until I found the episode, season 6 episode 14, One Little Ship!  Somehow I missed this when DS9 was on and it has never shown itself anywhere to me.  

Thinking back TNG was my crack as a kid and teen ( I can quote virtually every episode in the first few seasons), my wife and I binged voyager after we got married, and Enterprise was on after I was already out of college and living single life, so each of these I'm pretty sure I've not missed a single one. DS9 though was on during an odd time in my life... I was in college, trying o figure out my place in the world, bouncing from couch to couch, so I guess I can see how some episodes slipped through.  I didn't watch the finale until years after it had aired.

So yeah next chance I get I'm totally watching this episode and will try to binge DS9 just so I can find any other episodes I may have missed.  Has anyone else done this? Heard of an episode that you somehow missed when the series was originally on???  If so which one?  And did it disappoint when you saw it?"

0,"I don't know if this post is allowed, but I realized lately that a lot of people love Star Wars, but don't know a whole lot about specific aspects. If people want to ask questions, I think it would be cool if there was a thread where people could share Star Wars lore. 

For example, I was talking with some people on r/PrequelMemes, and noticed that a lot of people don't know about the different forms of lightsaber combat, so I thought I'd drop a short summary. 

 Form 1 is Shii-cho, also known as Way of the Sarlacc. It’s the basic form, learned by younglings, focusing on several key points of contact. 

Form 2, Makashi, is used most often on lightsaber on lightsaber combat. Users position their feet in a line, and often use curved sabers for better balance. Makashi grips are often farther down the hilt for more maneuverability and leverage. Dooku is the most obvious and well-known practitioner of this form. 

Soresu is form 3, most notably used by Obi-wan Kenobi. It focuses on defense, although makes it harder to go on the offensive. His mixed style of his master’s Ataru and Soresu (which he studied after Qui-gon’s death upon learning of one of the key weaknesses of Ataru that got his master killed) helps strengthen his lightsaber combat. More Jedi started using Soresu during the wars, to help create an impenetrable defense. 

Ataru (most obviously used by Qui-gon, and of course, Yoda) is form 4, and uses a lot of force acrobatics. It’s been favored by smaller creatures after Yoda’s prowess was evident, but larger species are still practitioners of the form. 

Form 5 includes two different aspects, Djem so and Shien. Djem so is most notably used by Anakin Skywalker. This was created by form 3 users who wanted a better opportunity to attack, so it utilizes a counter-attack strategy. Shein is based upon blaster bolt deflection back at their owners.

Form 6 is Niman, and it’s basically a mix of techniques from most of the forms. I'm fairly sure Sheev Palpatine is one of the practitioners of this form.

Form 7 is Juyo (which Vaapad is a variant of, created by Master Windu). It’s a Sith form that focuses on using emotion to drive combat, and is incredibly rarely practiced by Jedi, if at all. It's most often only practiced by few specific masters that are selected to learn it, and Jedi need permission to learn this form.  Vaapad is different than the typical Juyo mostly because of which emotions are used to fuel the combat. Juyo feeds off of hate, anger, and fear, while Vaapad uses those same emotions but also encourages an inner balance. I don’t know a whole lot about Juyo, but Vaapad is supposed to be a really unpredictable form, and I’ve always found it interesting. 

Other such notable saber styles are Jar'Kai, which is two saber fighting, and the reverse grip, both used by Ashoka Tano. Some force-wielders don't use lightsabers at all, but have other weapons such as a force-enhanced staff. Other Jedi use variations from the typical lightsaber, represented by the double-bladed lightsabers wielded by the temple guard, Yoda's Shoto (a smaller lightsaber used in two-weapon fighting as a secondary weapon, or for smaller Jedi as a primary one), lightwhips, lightclubs (I swear if autocorrect changes this to nightclubs one more time, I'm going to go insane), among other obvious variations such as the curved-hilt lightsaber. 

Anyways, if anyone else wants to share their Star Wars lore, I'd love to learn more about the universe. Actually, if people know more about Sith Lords such as Darth Bane and Revan, or where I can find more information on them, it would be really cool to learn more about that aspect of Star Wars."

I remember reading a post a few months ago (not sure how old the post was when I found it), about someone noticing blaster sounds in the background of Return of the Jedi during the scene where Luke is trying to escape the Death Star with Vader and all the Stormtroopers and Imperial personnel are running around trying to evacuate. The post was asking what the blaster shots could have been, because they weren’t coming from ships in the space battle and there were no Rebels present on the Death Star other than Luke and the Imperials seemed to be ignoring him and Vader. OP was wondering who was doing the shooting and what they could have been shooting at. A commenter suggested their head canon was that the Imperials were shooting at each other, and that a civil war of sorts had broken out aboard the Death Star with Imperials desperately trying to escape and killing each other over shuttles and escape pods. There was also a YouTube clip of the scene linked (presumably by OP) where the blaster sounds in question could be heard. 

It was a very interesting read and I’m trying to uncover it again. I tried searching various key words I could think of, but couldn’t find it. I’m 99% sure the post was on Reddit, though it’s possible it could have been posted to a different sub. I know it’s not a lot to go, but any help finding the post would be appreciated."

0,"Firstly, I want to note that by ""relate,"" I don't mean that I will kill younglings or do the horrible things that VADER did lol. 

I think a big reason why Anakin is my favorite character is because I think he's very relatable. I love Obi-Wan, Mace, etc. But they're all just too good to be true, right? I don't see too much complexity in them as human beings if that makes sense. 

Anakin was flawed, but he was also good. Like all of us, I have my inner demons as Anakin did. But I'm also compassionate, caring, a good friend, son, etc. Anakin was all those things as well. I just feel bad for Anakin because he was obviously emotionally vulnerable and the Jedi Order just told him to shut those feelings out. We know that won't work. Shutting those feelings leads to a massive build up of such feelings. One day it'll explode, and that's what happened to Anakin. It also doesn't help to have someone you trust with your life end up manipulating you and basically making you his slave to serve his interests and aspirations either lol. 

He's a tragic character, but I do think he's an amazing example of how each person tries to battle good vs evil within themselves."
0,"I think it would be an interesting area to look at considering the potential ideas:

Finding an unstable kyber crystal (sorry if spelt wrong)

Hearing Vader's voice in his head from the helmet

Training with Snoke and the Praetorian Guards

Feeling conflicted inside from both the light and dark side of the force 

Etc etc

1,"Good news, everyone! 

Ever since I saw Futurama’s “In-A-Gaga-Da-Leela”, I can’t help but think of V’Ger as V-Giny. 

These are two of my favorite shows (Star Trek is obviously #1) and it makes me giggle, so I’m not mad about it. 

In fact, I love how much Futurama plays on Star Trek and it is probably why I love the show so much. “Where No Fan Has Gone Before” is one of the top Futurama episodes, imho. 

Anyway, thought some of y’all might share this experience. Anyone else? 

Live Long and Prosper!"
1,"A thought about Chain of Command: If Wesley had still been on the Enterprise when Jellico took over as Captain, I'm betting he wouldn't have been very patient with Wes. Granted, over time Wes became a pretty good officer, and not as much of an annoying kid like in the first couple of seasons. But considering how much Jellico disliked Riker, he probably wouldn't have cared much for Wesley.

And when the first half of Birthright aired back in March of 1993, and Worf was told that his father was still alive, I remember discussing it with friends, and I said that if he did find his father in the second part, I had the perfect person as Mogh: James Earl Jones. Imagine hearing that booming voice speaking Klingon (or even just taking to Worf in English)! It's too bad they didn't decide to cast him (no spoilers for anyone that hasn't seen it)."
0,"I was listening to Charles Soule talk about Star Wars with ""Star Wars Explained"" and I loved how passionate/knowledgeable he seemed. It's clear from his stories that he ""gets"" the universe. I'd much rather see a film script by him than a random Hollywood writer who just worked on ""Bad Boys 4"" and gets hired on to write a script now.

Rise of Skywalker was co-written by the writer for ""Justice League"" and ""Batman V Superman"" for cripe's sake."
0,"Before you atumatically skipt this, just hear me over pleas. 

You know what would be great ?

If the next sequel to the sequels, would start with Hondo telling ""We used a dagger to obtain ancient treasure. And then, my friend, we rode horses to a battle on an super star destroyer, to save the universe from raging undead Emperor."" 

Somebody: ""And what happend to them?"" 

Hondo: ""Oh the boy and a girl ? Who knows. Doesnt matter.""

That would imply that the whole sequels were just Hondos big talk, a legend of sort. And legends offten lacks logic, just as sequels.  This Which would just fit Hondo's character and we could just wonder what happened in reality."

It doesn't help that Dooku is more often seen in combat/action and thus he seems more fit than Palpatine(when he isn't spinning like a Beyblade, wielding a lightsaber)."

Obviously the title is largely unimportant, but all Star Trek shows are Star Trek: (1:3 words)

1,"It seems strange to have this episode focused on Odo coming to the understanding that he truly belong on DS9 is featured halfway into the last season when it seems like they'd have mapped out where he was going. 

It makes it seems like he's had a major change of heart by the end and it's especially weird considering the founders were dying out in Chimera meaning that was his last chance to even be with a changeling."
0,"The current timeline, as we all know, is generally measure as being X amount of years before or after the Battle of Yavin - BBY or ABY. I've heard that they recently tried to change it so that it relates more to the Starkiller Base Incident or some such, but no one really cares and we're all still gonna keep using the Battle of Yavin as the baseline, but that's irrelevant. The question I'm getting at is, how was the timeline configured before the events of A New Hope? Like, within the Star Wars universe, before the events of A New Hope ever happened, how did they refer to their years? It's not like ""Before the Battle of Yavin"" had any significance before the Battle of Yavin ever happened.

To put it in real world terms, it's like, if the birth of Jesus is the start of the ""common era"" or ""anno domini"", how would we have denoted the years before the birth of Jesus? (Which is something I'll likely be posting in history-based subreddits in the near future, but you get the point.)"
0,"With republic commando re releasing on ps5 and Nintendo switch I was flooded with nostalgia from this game. Played through the entire game and 100% it, just a shame it’s no longer canon.

I think it’s well overdue for a canonised remake/sequel.  The game could take a lot of inspiration from shooters that have released in years since the originals release. It could encapsulate the experience of being an elite operator and using stealth and espionage to your advantage as we’ve seen in the call of duty modern warfare series and also include the fun of being an absolute powerhouse such as in DOOM 2016.

Bringing the commandos back into the limelight in a video game is the only real way I can see their return to canon mean anything. They could be in their own animated series however I believe this would be too similar to the bad batch show we’re going to be getting."

And yes I did give Data chest hair. Yes, I giggled the whole time."
0,"I have been thinking about Snoke over the past several years, since The Last Jedi and I firmly believe that you could make him a more interesting villain. In my eyes, he would be the maintain antagonist for the entire Sequel trilogy and is Palpatine does not return except as a manifestation of the Force. For my version of Snoke, I had to completely re-write his entire back story and even parts of the post-Endor era for him to better fit in the story.

Snoke is a lowly, yet devoted scholar devoid of any Force powers, he records and studies sith artefacts for His imperial majesty, Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant. He is sent across the galaxy scaring for any ancient sith objects that willing to help achieve his master's plan and same time Snoke becomes increasingly obsessed with the Force and its nature. Despite being non-Force sensitive he wonders if any of these sith holocrons or scrolls contain the ability to grant normal being access to the Force. When the death of Palpatine reaches Coruscant, Snoke wastes no time in gathering as many sith holocrons and artefacts as he can and flees the imperial capital and head out towards to Outer Rim. He meets up with an imperial fleet and used his skills of manipulation and position on Coruscant you to convince them to obey his orders. He uses the resources of this imperial fleet to explore sith ruins and old temples to uncover more knowledge of the sith.

However, as Snoke's knowledge grows, so does the strength of the newly established New Galactic Republic (yes slight name change) as Imperial forces facture. Snoke reluctantly follows his fleet into the Unknown Region along with many other rogue Imperial force, however, his knowledge of former temples and strongholds allows his group to find a suitable area to set up a new base. As any of the remaining imperial struggles to determine who to lead, Snoke uses the chaos to his advantage to build mistrust among the power grabbers. He gives that appearance of neutrality while encouraging others to murder their competition and he builds groups of loyal followers through his knowledge of the Force. As competitors dwindle, Snoke kills those who remain in his way and become the leaders of this rogue Imperial Remnant faction, proclaiming the First Order.

Over the decades Snoke discovers a ritual that could grant him what he desires but requires ritual be done on Korriband/Morband with the blood of one born of Force, thus begins his search to be sacrificed. While he searches for his sacrifice, Snoke also orders the kidnapping of Force-sensitive to create a loyal group of Force-sensitive enforcers, the Knights of Ren, much like the Imperial Inquisitors of Palpatine. While Snoke focuses on his projects, the First Order engages in mass militarization with new foundries and shipyards constructed.

While the First Orders has managed to build new ships like the Resurgent-class star destroyer (my version is smaller than canon one), they still rely on ageing Imperial II-class star destroyers, though they have been modernized the best they could. It is important to note that the First Order military is not a cable of the New Galactic Republic's military, but Snoke and First Order high command have taken this into account. The First Order is not the only Imperial Remnant group, in fact, some remnant factions have been legitimate governments with a thriving society, while others remain in disarray. The First Order plans to stark another war between the New Republic and other Imperial Remnant factions while they would take advantage of the chaos and Snoke could head to Korriband/Morband to perform the ritual.

So, what do you think so far?"
1,"I am down to the last 5 Enterprise episodes and I am looking for opinions from people who have seen the entire series. 

Is the last episode worth watching? 
If I watch it will it spoil the rest of the series? 

I have been surprised how much I liked Ent, it has some of my favorite characters of any ST series but I know the finale is divisive and famously bad so I am torn whether to watch it or not. Thanks for any opinions you can offer."

0,"One of the most debated topics in star wars is that luke wants the jedi to end after being the creator of a new jedi order. But I think I understand why now.

Luke believes being a jedi, using the light side, is a paradox. When he gets close to a dark side chosen one, like vader or ben, the force tells him to kill them. With vader, he was beating him up before getting him to the light. With ben, the force told him to press the lightsaber down to kill the sith's new chosen one, because that will keep the light intact. 

BUT, as soon as he's about to kill ben and vader, he realizes that that will just make him to the dark side, since the jedi shouldn't use the force to kill. So he thinks the jedi should end, because the force tells him to kill the dark side, but that turns him to the dark side."

1,"I recently got access to the OpenAI beta.  I've been playing around with it by dumping in parts of scripts from chakoteya and seeing what it generates.  Sometimes it hits gold, so here is some of my favourites:

Seeded with ""The Die is Cast"":

    [Warbird corridor] 
    GARAK: You're going to try to escape, aren't you?
    ODO: I've been thinking about it.
    GARAK: I think you should.
    ODO: I was afraid you'd say that.
    GARAK: I know you have no reason to trust me, but I want you to know I'm on your side.
    ODO: That's what I'm afraid of.

Seeded with everything Sisko says in his log in ""In the Pale Moonlight"".  I'd like to point out Kovalet is a Cardassian settlement on Ithic 2 from a beta novel, and the seed text contained no mention of the obsidian order.

    
    O'BRIEN: Sir, I'm picking up a transmission from a Cardassian ship.
    SISKO: Put it through.
    ODO: A Cardassian ship is approaching the station.
    SISKO: On screen.
    (It's the ""Kovalet"" and the colour scheme is all wrong.)
    SISKO: This is Commander Benjamin Sisko. We have nothing to say to you, Cardassians. Go home.
    KIRA: They're coming in anyway.
    SISKO: On screen.
    GARAK: I am Garak. I have a message for Commander Sisko from the Obsidian Order.
    SISKO: From what?
    GARAK: The Obsidian Order.
    SISKO: I've never heard of it.
    GARAK: It's the Cardassian intelligence organisation.
    SISKO: What's the message?
    GARAK: I am to inform the commander that the Cardassian government has no knowledge of any plot to attack the Founders' home world.
    SISKO: And I'm to believe you because?
    GARAK: I am here at the request of the Order to help clear up this misunderstanding.
    SISKO: I think you have something more to say.
    GARAK: It's not Cardassian policy to discuss matters of intelligence over open channels.
    KIRA: You're right. He does have something more to say.
    SISKO: Then let him say it.
    GARAK: I'm afraid that's not possible. If you want to know what I know, you'll have to come with me.

This was primed with ONLY the scene in Picard's quarters from The Pegasus when Picard grills Riker about the mutiny aboard the Pegasus.

    [Ready room]
    PICARD: Come.
    RIKER: Captain.
    PICARD: You've been very busy, Number One. I haven't seen you for days.
    PICARD: I wanted to apologise for my behaviour in my quarters. I reacted emotionally. I allowed my personal feelings to interfere with my duty.
    RIKER: Ah.
    PICARD: Do you think that I should have accepted your decision?
    RIKER: No, sir. I think it was the wrong decision, but I think you should have let me make it. That's what I'm here for.
    PICARD: And what if it had been a mistake?
    RIKER: Then I would have been responsible for that mistake.
    PICARD: And I would hold you accountable.
    RIKER: Yes, sir, you would. That's the way it works.
    PICARD: I am responsible for this ship. You are responsible for the lives of the crew.
    RIKER: Yes, sir.
    PICARD: I would hope that you would come to me if you had a problem.
    RIKER: I did.
    PICARD: Not with the mission. I'm talking about what happened on the Pegasus.
    RIKER: I can't, sir. I have my orders.
    PICARD: Orders can be changed.
    RIKER: Not by me.
    PICARD: I'm ordering you to tell me what happened on the Pegasus.
    RIKER: No, sir.
    PICARD: I'm not sure I can trust you anymore.
    RIKER: That's your choice, sir.
    PICARD: I will not give you a direct order. You will remain first officer. You will continue to be my eyes and ears on this ship. Bypass me if you must, go over my head, but I want you to keep me informed of all that you're doing.
    RIKER: I will.
    PICARD: Dismissed.

    GEORDI: The ship's still holding together, but just barely. They're going to have to abandon it soon.
    RIKER: How're they going to do that?
    GEORDI: I don't know.
    RIKER: They've managed to keep it hidden for twelve years. There must be a way to get it off the planet.
    GEORDI: You'd think so, wouldn't you?"
1,"Seems to involve time travel in someway, maybe a reference to the events of Endgame?"
1,"There were some different Starfleet uniforms in use throughout the season, and I would appreciate anyone with any knowledge of their rhyme and reason to select what they did, but I found the finale uniforms worn on the bridge of discovery to be rather regal/ emissarial with their division color shown   
vertically on the length of the shirt rather than the usual on the shoulders.

I know Star trek discovery comes with contentious territory.  
But I wanted to inquire if anyone else had insight or opinion to the uniforms used during their season."
1,"In the very first episode of TNG we were introduced to the powerful Q, the official Memelord of the fandom and frankly a very scary entity, however the scene in which he made fun of humans turned into a human general who urged the Captain to prepare to fight the ""Commies"".

The first reaction is ""Lol, Picard makes fun of the general's uniform but he wear a space pajama"", but if you think about it, it has its logic:

That's because for the Picard and the Federation in general, organized armies are not only inherently bad but ridiculous.

Why would someone give up their individuality and freedom to become a puppet of an elite that doesn't care about their life at all? It literally doesn't make any sense to someone who grew up in the Federation culture!"

0,"I mean, I’m excited for the new shows, but they really need to branch out of the Skywalker era. 

There is enough lore that they planted the seed to do a show in that Old Republic era without it being completely out of left field. I know people want Revan, but I think given the fact that general audiences know about Mandalorians and the Dark Saber, they should make a show about Tarre Vizsla and the origin story of the Dark Saber. 

But whatever, they need to branch out some way or another."
1,Are transporters part Betazoid? How else do they know who to transport when an officer says “Three to transport”? I’m confused about how the transporter knows which organisms to kick on to when not specified explicitly. Do the transporters know context clues?
1,"So years ago when I was really into ST, most of the novels ""didn't count"". Is this still the case? I'm listening to the audiobook of Picard: Last Best Hope and it's great for the backstory to Season 1 of Picard, but could they completely disregard it in future episodes?"
1,"Ok don’t get me wrong, I like DISC and it is a good series but for me season 3 is the “make or break” point in a Star Trek series like VOY and DS9 season 3 is when things started to get good and I suppose the same is true for DISC. But I watch Star Trek to see something better than myself, better than what is going on now and a brilliant future for us all, sure you got the Romulans, Jem’hadar, etc. But how much do they affect the day to day citizen on Earth, Vulcan, Tellar prime or Andor, but then the burn. That affected everyone in the galaxy, where was the Q or prophets, why didn’t Sisko do something? Also dosent it undo the work of Kirk, Picard, Archer, Sisko and Janeway who have saved millions, probably billions of lives in their careers. I just think they were trying to keep people engaged by changing the story every season instead of starting an overall story which would take 7 seasons to end like DS9 and VOY (also TNG a bit with Q). In conclusion I think DISC has a lot of potential but for now they need to stick to a time and universe for a while because I do not want to see the Kelvin Timeline appear anytime soon. I hate that thing."
1,"After watching ST: Discos Terra Firma, I went back and watched TOS: The City on the Edge of Forever.  So spoilers for that and Ent: In a  Mirror, Darkly, all of the DS9 Mirror Universe episodes., and DS9, Past Tense (Bell Riots) 

In City of Edge of Forever, Kirk has to make a choice to save Edith Keeler or let her die. If she lives, she goes on to bring pacifism to America, delaying US entry to WWII, allowing Nazis to get the A-Bomb first and conquer the globe. My theory is this decision creates the Mirrorverse divide. We know from Ent: In a Mirror, Darkly, that First Contact with Cochrane went differently. The Vulcan's arrived and instead of peace, humans offered death and power. This allowed humans, even after WWIII to overpower the Vulcans and conquer much of the quadrant. But why? Are humans just innate brutes in this universe? No, in DS9: Crossover we learn that Mirror Spock was successful in introducing a less hostile approach to the Empire, eventually leading to its collapse. We see in Terra Firma that Georgia changed her belief system in just her time in our universe. So why did Cochrane attack?

I believe because of the events of of Edith Keeler, humans lived a life seeing pacifism as evil. The Nazis conquered the world via brutality and that became the norm, especially for POC (important later). Next consider the Bell Riots. I think its safe to surmise that even in Mirror Universe this sort of event took place, in fact it may have been catalyst for WWIII/Eugenics war. In our time, Bell Riots take place 2024 and WWIII starts in 2026. What if the Mirror Uni Bell Riots was an uprising in one of the Nazi ghettos eventually leading to their overthrow and the establishment of a ""free"" earth but with all the brutal social constructs as a necessity guarding against the ""bad"" elements of facism. Now, genetic purity is no longer important and gives rise to the Discovery Mirror Universe where diversity is a part of life, POC from all over can kill their neighbor and claim their lands, Equality! 

(You can even speculate to Disco- Georgia arriving at a Pre-Mirror, Mirror Spock (whom she would have an uncanny familiarity with) and laying the groundwork for his decision to overthrow the Empire.)  

What does this have to do with DS9's Mirror archs? Julian Bashir. If my theory were true, the Mirror Universe would not have had a Eugenics War as the Nazi's would have merely celebrated the arrival of the perfect human. In fact, this is what may have lead to the creation of the Mirror ghettos that would spawn their Bell Riots. So after these events, and the establishment of the new Terra ideals of might makes right, I can see no reason to suspect Bashir would be augmented in the mirror universe (unless it was a cunning move by his father to create a leader capable of winning the Terran Resistance, this would explain Mirror Bashir keeping the Julian v. Jules name. I kinda like this cause it makes Bashir's Dad Mirror cunning instead of hapless).

0,"As every Star Wars fan knows, ever since his inception in Return of the Jedi, Palpatine has always been depicted as the ultimate evil. A tyrannical dictator who rules the galaxy with an iron fist, as well as a powerful sorcerer with supreme mastery over the dark side of the force. The prequels made no efforts in trying to make us sympathize with him, instead depicting him as a Machiavellian mastermind who started a war in order to  manipulate the galaxy into giving him absolute power under the guise of claiming that the republic needs a authoritarian leader in order to steer it through troubled times. He turned the whole galaxy against the Jedi, and turned Anakin to the dark side by claiming that only he can save his wife. He is a monster that caused decades of misery and untold suffering and death simply due to his selfish desire for power. And there hasn't been a single material set in the Star Wars Universe that has ever tried to portray him with redeeming or sympathetic qualities.

Yet Star Wars Underworld, a canceled live action TV series that was supposed to set between ROTS and A New Hope, would've changed all that. Former Lucasarts employee Cory Balrog (He's the one who directed the God of War series) one time revealed that he read a script at Skywalker Ranch for the Scrapped TV series featuring a more humanized Palpatine, in this script, he would have been depicted as a sympathetic figure who was wronged by a Heartless female gangster, perhaps taking place in Palpatine's past having it be the event that set him down the path of darkness. Sadly the exact details of what the woman did to him has not been revealed but Balrog claimed that it almost brought him to tears when he read it.

Hearing about this online makes me wonder? How would fans react if the storyline presented in the script was ever fully realized? I honestly believe it would have been a very controversial decision. Some might have welcomed it, happy that Palpatine, when before was depicted as a somewhat generic pure evil villain, was finally given some much needed depth. Others would've probably be angry at how the show choose to depict Palpatine, for they believe that making him sympathetic would be against the very idea of what the character is supposed to be. Maybe he is better off remaining the ultimate evil, for we already have Darth Vader for a more nuanced, tragic villain.

How would you feel about a more humanized, sympathetic take on the infamous Sith Lord? Would it be something you would be interested in seeing such a depiction? Or did Star Wars dodge a bullet by canceling Underworld? Tell me of your thoughts down below at the comments."
1,"Last night I watched TOS 1.21, *The Return of The Archons*. By asking open-ended questions about free will, Kirk gets the computer, Landru, which controls the entire planet, to malfunction.

In *I, Borg*, Geordi and Data design an unsolvable geometric formula meant to overwhelm the Borg's processing power, with the hope to eventually shut down the collective.

Do computers really work that way--even today? Is it realistic to think that computers could ever face a challenge which would cause them to use so much processing power that they burned themselves out, or got stuck in an actual disabling feedback loop?

1,The version I saw was a little longer but I only saw that version once. Most of those scenes are now unfinished deleted scenes on the Blu Ray. I’m wondering what the story was behind that. There’s even foot prints of those deleted scenes in the actual movie that exists today.
1,"So I just finished Season 2 and immediately picked up on where the writers were drawing their inspirations from.

The first half of the season starts off like *The Mothman Prophecies* from 2002 starring Richard Gere. In that film &gt;!a strange, mysterious winged creature/entity appears as a visual distortion backed by bright light to either signal doom or warn people of an upcoming catastrophe.  People who are a witness the creature/entity have dreams, nightmares and become obsessed and frantically create a series of disturbing drawings and sketches of how it appeared to them. !&lt;

This is pretty much what happens in Discovery S2 with Spock being a witness to the Red Angel, becoming obsessed with it and creating all these illustrations of it, even as an adult. 

The second half of the Disco's S2 becomes *The Terminator* or every sci-fi movie where the military/government trusts their A.I. to make all their tough decisions and protect them, only for it to be come self aware and threaten to destroy humanity. Control is pretty much Skynet and Gabrielle's travel to the future shows the aftereffects of Judgement Day. Michael and the Disco crew have to prevent that future from happening and fight Control controlled humans who act like Arnie's T-800, impervious to projectile fire, and able to take the appearance of anyone they come into contact with like the mimetic alloyed T-1000. Even shooting a hole through Leland just allows himself to reseal it just like the T-1000 does, or take form as a fast crawling fluid.  

The tail end of the season is *Iron-Man*. Gabrielle Burnham is revealed to be a Howard Stark-like inventor who creates an amazing powersource/power-suit. Michael is like Tony Stark, having to use her parent's tech to recreate a power-suit of her own to save the day. We even get visual call backs to the *Iron-Man* film with close-ups of Michael in the suit with the interface reflected onscreen, and the traditional superhero landing/take-off pose. 

I'm assuming that the Klingon home world stuff is supposed to be like *Game of Thrones* but since I haven't seen the HBO series I can't say for certain. The final battle reminded me of the CGI outer space battles of the *Star Wars* prequels. I think I even saw some droids repairing the Discovery at some point.

Am I missing any other inspirations?"
0,"Okay so as I said in a post yesterday, I finished the prequels as well as 4, 5, and 6. Now I'm not sure what to do lol. What order should I do the rest of the movies/the shows?

Should I watch Rogue One and then the sequels? And do I watch Clone Wars movie before the animated series? Where do I fit in Rebels into all this?

Appreciate the help!"

1,"SO, just watched ST6 for the umpteenth time and I just now noticed this... Is the president of the Federation  Klingon?  OK, he's played by Kurtwood Smith (Dad in that 70's show and also Clarence Botticker in Robocop 'bitches  leave'), small part, but that's ok.  Thing is, he looks like a Klingon.  This might be fine years down the road but at this point in  star trek history, it doesn't  make sense.  Their  decades  long cold  war  with  the Klingons  is only  now coming  to a close. There's a Klingon ambassador there, that makes sense, even countries we're at war with would keep an ambassador with their rivals.  So what gives?  Does he just LOOK Klingon, does he just have an insane haircut with a large head?  Is he an unnamed species?  

I did a quick google about him and the wiki gave me  nothing."
1,"I can't recall the name of an episode from either TOS or TNG. In it, an old Federation officer and his with get younger. 

It ends with with them deciding to return to their normal ages and the officer saying there was no point in reliving his life because he has no regrets. 

Anyone know what the episode is?

EDIT: Solved, it was ""The Counter-Clock Incident"" from The Animated Series."
1,"I don't remember the episode, maybe somebody who has a brain for remembering those details can help, but its one of the awesomest shots I've ever seen in any trek.  It starts exterior of the bridge near the domed sky light (space light?) and comes ""down"" (relative to the orientation of the ship) ""through"" the dome right above the captains chair before cutting to a regular angle facing the chair. I know from behind the scenes of TNG that the ""front wall"" of the bridge set was removable depending on the camera angle. I often wonder if they had cameras that were not on some sort of dolly system but were simply carried by cameramen like they do today"

1,"So comparing the Crossfield class (like the USS Discovery and USS Glenn) to a modern ship like the Galaxy class Enterprise - D, it's very long and flat, is there any point to this design other than that all the ships in shows before the Crossfield class have also been tall, like the Galaxy class that is 36(I think, I don't remember exactly) decks"
0,"""There's always some truth to Legends.""

A lot of fans went nuts with Ahsoka's line in a season trailer for Rebels, and celebrated the arrival of the *Sphyrna*\-class corvette, which was a clear nod to the *Hammerhead*\-class cruiser that appeared in the fan favorite KOTOR and SWTOR games. What they probably don't know, however, is that Lucasfilm didn't stop there. Since then, some writers have went absolutely crazy (in a good way) with canonizing old Legends concepts. Some were more like analogues, others were direct ""lore ports"" from Legends.

These analogues/""ports"" include Naga Sadow, Uliq Qel Droma, Revan, Empress Teta, Ooroo, Jaster Mereel (along with Jango Fett's backstory of being a real Mandalorian warrior), Durge, and even Kyle Katarn. Most of these characters I would've never guessed would have made a return to canon, but once freaking Kyle Katarn was made canon (albeit through a canonically-ambiguous card game), I knew the Pandora's Box was open. Obviously a lot of their stories had to be tweaked or completely rewritten to fit into the new canon timeline, but it still has me excited for who else we could see.

I'd personally want to see a return of Rahm Kota, one of my absolutely favorite characters in the universe next to Canderous Ordo and Hondo Ohnaka. Obviously Galen Marek/Starkiller's story was so whacky that it barely even fit into Legends, meaning we'd unfortunately have to wipe that part of Rahm's story, but his entire backstory prior to meeting Starkiller could absolutely fit into new canon, and he could still be made to play a role in the formation of the Rebel Alliance. Hell, maybe even Starkiller could come back but retconned to be a rogue Imperial Inquisitor or something.

Who do you guys want to see make a return? Do you think the writers would have to change their story up or were the already compatible with the new timeline?"
0,"The show is outstanding in terms of showing instead of telling and the animation is incredible.

Not to even mention how they portrays the Jedi and visually displays how powerful they are at their peak. The details are greatly appreciated, how mace windu crushes him to give grievous his signature cough, count dooku recommending he should retreat at times, the Vader visions and of course the battle on Yavin IV.

Grievous in Rots while impressive only gets his moment in the spotlight very briefly and in the 3D clone wars show he becomes a bit of a “villain of the week” but still having his moments. My favourite quote of his from the 3D show is: “I do not care about your politics! I don't care about your, Republic! I only live to see you die!"" Grievous didn’t care about governing power or otherwise ruling the Galaxy, his sole purpose was to destroy the Jedi.

The 2D show turns Grievous into a legitimate horror movie villain creating shock whenever he appears from the initial appearance taking on the 5 stranded jedi and wiping the floor with them to the attack on Coruscant where Shaak Ti panics just by hearing his footsteps again. Then when he does appear after creeping into the scene he is a pure devastating force.

I hope this version of clone wars being redistributed may lead to other artistic interpretations of Star Wars stories in the animated short form. Basically just give Genndy Tartakovsky everything he’d need for another round of this show potentially based in the OT or sequels."

0,"So I was watching Episode III today, and I noticed something kinda nice during the Order 66 scene.

During the part when the Kashyyyk trooper gets the order from Palpatine, you can see Tarfful bending over to talk to Yoda. I never paid much attention to that until today, but it occurs to me that he might be checking on Yoda, perhaps noticing that he just kneeled in pain but not knowing why.

I might be misinterpreting the scene, but it kinda fits with what I've seen of other Wookie behaviors - for all the growling and roaring, they can be very sensitive sometimes.

Also, just after the attack, Chewbacca stops to let Yoda climb onto him before running off. I can't imagine Wookies just randomly let people ride them. Again, shows a kind of sensitivity that I thought was sweet."
0,"What really confuses me about the original trilogy is that why did the Original human Jabba the Hutt change to... well, a ""Hutt"".

And then when the slave commits suicide Archer chews out Trip for treating it like a real person with intelligence, dreams, and desires? Idk dude, maybe they committed suicide because you turned them down for asylum and doomed them to a life of being a literal slave with no autonomy over their body or life choices? 

And they try to make it into some sort of bullshit argument about moral relativity and cultural differences. Slavery is not an acceptable cultural difference. What a crock of shit. Most fucked up episode out of the hundreds I’ve seen. The absolute antithesis of Star Trek’s moral values.

Edit: honestly stunning and disappointing how many people defend this episode"

1,"In Voyager Scorpion, Janeway makes a deal with the Borg to give them vital information necessary to defeat Species 8472 in exchange for safe passage through their space. Janeway acts like the information is a bargaining chip. And ridiculously, the Borg take the deal.

Yet, the Borg don't need to bargain with Janeway in order to get the information. All they have to do is simply assimilate them and their ship and they will have every single bit of knowledge that Janeway thinks is her bargaining chip. And knowing Voyager has this vital info about their enemy would likely make them more inclined to assimilate them even more quickly. It would be more efficient and they'd have their cake and eat it too. Why in the hell would they bargain.

This is a horrible plot hole. It's maddening how stupid this is.

1,"This is the infamous episode where the crew goes back in time and meets mark twain. A race of alien beings are going back in time and harvesting the energy of humans in the 19th century. The crew ends up stopping them (I believe by killing them) but my question is how moral the choice to stop them actually was. rewatching the episode it seems like the alien race is only harvesting the bodies of people just about to die. The only two harvests we see are of a sickly bum half unconscious in a back alley and then again at a sick ward with patients dying of cholera. If the alien race had a log of deaths in the past, then couldn’t that mean they were harvesting the energies of humans right before they were going to die naturally anyway? Is ending someone’s life a minute before they would naurally expire be that big of a deal, especially if it’s the only thing allowing the aliens to survive? What do you guys think?"

Why is he always the moral one, the badass, the brave one, the smart one, and the funny one all at the same time. It's so bad. The show could have been halfway decent if archer were written more realistically and portraid by a solid actor. Anyone else feel this way? Just curious I guess."

I have been thinking about my rank list of Star Wars Episode Movies and I feel like I went with the crowd for the most part on liking the first two Star Wars Movies, I come to the conclusion that while not bad movies, that Episode IV and Episode V are actually my least favorite movies in the Franchise.

My rank list is;

1st- Return of the Jedi

2nd- Revenge of the Sith

3rd- The Force Awaken

4th- The Last Jedi

5th- Attack of The Clones

6th/7th- The Rise of Skywalker

6th/7th- The Phantom Menance

8th- A New Hope

9th- The Empire Strikes Back

TRS and TPM are interchangeable because I didn't see Episode 1 growing up and The Rise of Skywalker felt like it needed to explain more clearly. Attack of the Clones what makes it below the Last Jedi is the fact that watching the movie entirely raises more questions than it answers, and some deleted scenes are what answer some of those questions.

Having to Repost this because of the Title on how I did not know how to title it correctly.

1,"Now I personally adore the original Star Trek. The lead characters are fantastic and get great dialogue to work with, and the side characters to after a little while, the stories are sometimes actually thought-provoking and compelling, and the direction and special effects, for the time, can be quite dazzling.

But let's be real, after the first season, I dunno, maybe they start to run out of fresh ideas. A lot of the episodes are the same blueprint of the crew landing on an alien planet where it's just humans from a different time period like old Chicago or the Wild West. Some of the allegory and social commentary is so obvious and hamfisted that while it might have been profound once, it's pedantic now. And while some of the episodes are thrilling and exciting even by today's standards, a lot of them are just agonizingly dull.

So I'm wondering, besides the people who grew up watching the show when it was fresh, does anyone genuinely think the Original Series ranks higher than what I would call the ""perfected"" Star Treks?"

1,"Think about it, they could totally rehabilitate the most maligned episode in Star Trek canon.  

Imagine the crew of Cerritos visiting Ligon II.  The in-jokes and gags would be limited only by the writers' courage.  

The crew of the Cerritos arrives at Ligon II in search of a rare vaccine. (Plot 1).  Legend has it that the Enterprise once performed a similar mission, but all records have been mysteriously destroyed (plot 2).  

Captain Freeman orders the Cerritos to hail the planet.  On screen appears a man with bright purple skin.  Apparently, the inhabitants cycle through every color of the visible spectrum on a regular schedule.  The Bright purple leader, an excessively pompous and arrogant man, takes a liking to Tendi on account of the fact the Ligonians enter their fertility period around the same time that they cycle to green.

1,"I've been working through TNG on netflix since the pandemic started and just made it through ""Best of Both Worlds"" and ""Family"" (I know that's not much progress for a year but I've got little kids. Cut me some slack! 😁).

I found myself watching with a much closer eye since so much of this arc relates to ST: Picard now and I had a few thoughts that I wanted to share.

Generally speaking I thought the story holds up. I definitely got caught up with a huge grin on my face for Riker's line at the end of part one. This time through I had the thought that it would have been a really powerful way to start the part two episode to have Jonathan Frakes to the voice over for the intro rather than Patrick Stewart. Since Riker had been officially promoted (pips and all) hearing Picard do his usual voice over gave me a false sense of security that I knew the episode would be canned rather than really sucking the audience in that it could have been an actual permanent change. Given the era in which this was made this may be just too modern of a thought about how to mess with the viewers.

Will's promotion was also still as confusing as it was when I was a kid. I was always confused why it was such a big deal between him and Shelby for who was doing what job, and after ""Family"" it's not really mentioned.

Also, Shelby. I feel like in the subsequent seasons or other ST titles they could have used Elizabeth Dennehy really effectively. I thought her relationship with Will was really interesting and nuanced and felt like a much more modern Trek like ST Discovery.

In the end though. Still a great arc that I enjoyed just a much as when I was a kid!"

The ship as it is shown in TOS is radically different from the ship shown in ST: TMP. Its like comparing a 1969 Corvette to a 1985 Corvette.

We know that it is the same ship. The Enterprise was not replaced with a new model. Are we supposed to imagine that the ship looked just the way it was in TOS, and then its refit, overhaul, or whatever we want to call it was just that huge and that its appearance was so transformed? Its like they replaced 50% if the ship, and added stuff too. Even the interior is transformed. Admiral Kirk is not sure which way he's going when he walks down a corridor in TMP.

In a way, it would have made so much more sense if they just said they built a new ship and called THAT ship NCC-1701-A.

Or are we just supposed to reconcile it on our own, and imagine that the TOS Enterprise was more modern than it appeared, making the transformation not as substantial as it appeared?"
0,"""My theory is that Ben Kenobi had dementia

Ok, I know it's weird, but lemme explain. 

In episode IV when Obi Wan says that he never had a droid you may think that this is just because the movie was released before the prequels (since we see hik with R4 in episodes II and III), but why would the writers of the prequels make him have a droid even tough he clearly said that he DIDN'T, or even how would he not remember R2, I mean, why would these droids be there if he ""never had one"". So my theory says that Obi Wan had dementia due to the stress that he suffered after the events of Episode III. And that's why he told Luke that Anakin was killed by Darth Vader he's memory was that Darth Vader and Anakin were not the same person, he forgot what happened in Mustafar and believed in another story based on the interpretation of his own mind. I believe that this is stage 2 of dementia, where some memories are lost, but other still intact.""

1,"I reviewed the second episode of TNG - The Naked Now on [Rough in the Diamonds](https://spoti.fi/342ePtZ) podcast.

Want to know a little about it? Ok, I'll tell you!

It was an amazing episode: amazing not in the sense that it was good, but the combination of elements that made it up were extraordinary. There was a flying couch, a soundboard phone prank, a sweaty man hanging out with a child, all kinds of sexy times, and an android doing a Google search for a good part the episode. See what I mean? Amazing.

Yet it (should have) had a strong plot: mystery disease makes it aboard &gt; infection spreads &gt; doctors cure sickness &gt; doctors are wrong &gt; everyone will die &gt; doctors find a true cure at the last moment. Add an existential threat of an exploding star or whatever, and we should have a really really good episode on our hands.

But we don't.

And it's not.

It was the second episode in the entire series, a show trying to win new viewers while winning over viewers of the original series. To do an episode so irrational and bizarre was... well... irrational and bizarre. 

If they'd dumped the outrageous silliness (they could have kept plenty of fun), kept these new characters in character while we learned what they were like, and maybe even moved the episode somewhere deeper in the series, it would have been much better, and much more appreciated.

I kind of loved it though.

I read that George Lucas made the decision during the filming of Empire Strikes Back, however, after rewatching it, the first meeting between Vader and the Emperor would suggest otherwise. They constantly referred to Anakin as a separate body, and never gave any real hint that Vader was the father of Luke. Is it possible that that scene was designed in such a way to keep the viewers guessing, or was it merely a late-film decision to make Vader his father?"

I’ve seen a popular theory floating around that palpatine actually killed padme by draining her life force to sustain anakin. Yes, this enhances sidious’ character in a sense but I’d argue the real magic lies in the tragedy. 

Ep 3 frames Anakin’s primary internal conflict around his love for his wife and his duty to the jedi council. He has a vision of her dying and suddenly this conflict is shifted heavily towards one side. The said savior of prophesy has now found his own to which he seeks to prevent.

Palpatine manipulates him to believe he should join the dark side and maybe save his bae, so he takes the chance. Then he self-full filled the prophecy of his own making by choking her out and nearly killing her before childbirth and so she dies giving birth to the very children that would redeem him. his own fate that he gave up everything to thwart.

THATS beautiful to me. It’s tragic, painful, and listen I understand the “palpatine actually killed her” part of the fandom. That elevates HIM, but to what? He’s just... MORE manipulative than he was before? I don’t find that interesting. It doesn’t expand on the tragedy of Vader. Really the manipulation of anakin throughout his life and in the confrontations in his office and at the opera serve that point perfectly fine.

Yikes this was a rant. I don’t post a lot on Reddit ever, but this rewatch triggered something in me. So ya Hayden choked Natalie out and then she like immediately had to give childbirth and that’s probs what killed her, Senate really didn’t have to do anything Ted talk over post"
0,"Can force-sensitive people fly or levitate (NOT JUMP VERY HIGH OR DASH, THAT'S NOT FLYING) in general? Yes.  
1) Rey in Star Wars IX was levitating  
2) Bendu from Star Wars Rebels, S3E21 (or last episode of 3rd season) was flying while shooting lightning bolts in rage.  
3) Luke Skywalker, whilst projecting himself on planet Crait (SW VIII, Skywalker vs. Kylo Ren fight), was levitating.   
4) Cal Kestis could jump after force pushing/pulling undefinitely ~~of course if we consider bugs in JFO cannon lol.~~   
5) Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus, compared to other jedi, could levitate almost freely - while other jedi had to be in peace, he could fly in relatively hostile environment.

&gt;!Notable mentions: well, nobody can deny that Anakin, Obi-wan, Darth Maul, Palpatine and every other force-sensitive being with a spaceship was flying at least once, or why'd they have a spaceship lol!&lt;

If you know any other cases of jedi flying (not forcemoving someone else or high jumping), please report them."
0,"In Clone Wars legends and current canon, it has consistently written that Mace blamed himself / felt responsibility for the entire clone war itself as he failed to strike down Dooku immediately when the whole “This party is over.” shenanigans on Geonosis happened. It makes perfect sense he’d ALSO guilt himself over not having struck down palatine when he had the chance instead of even addressing dumbass 22 year old anakin’s whiny winging about standing trial. 

I’m literally not going to argue why a hero character, one of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy no less, in franchise notorious for bringing back characters who supposedly fell to their deaths, would survive a fall such that he did. Especially after all the cirque de solei in flying traffic Anakin and Obi Wan willingly did in the previous movie. 

There’s also no reason why he wouldnt cut himself off from the force (as Luke later did) and go into hiding on, let’s say Nar Shadda, where he develops his Vaapaad fighting style by moonlighting /disguised as a Ubese master swordsman (wearing the sith stalker force unleashed outfit, which is actually based on boushh [@me if I’m
wrong]) in the Haxion Brood’s blood tournament (from Jedi fallen order). His aim could be to seize control of the criminal underworld to put it against the empire (perhaps this takes place around the time of solo where there is no organized rebellion of yet and luke skywalker is like... 10 years old.) 

While there on Nar Shadda he could also have met and began protecting the Baby Grogu - whom Huyang (clone wars canon) saved from the Jedi temple a decade prior. Maybe this newfound guardianship helps Mace slowly reconnect with the force. This development might also mean Mace is discovered by Xizor (a character notorious for knowing everything about his enemies).((also, see how this could be an entire spin off series? They could call if “the swordsman” who cares ?))

Perhaps Xizor tips off Vader of Mace’s whereabouts because he hopes they will destroy each other - or more likely , as Mace will kill Vader, whom he hates. Win, win, win for Xizor.

That being said, right as Mace is about to end Vader after an epic ass Nar Shadda rooftop fight  (because he is literally the only Jedi, save Yoda, strong enough in the force to defeat him at this point in time - remember ole Obi-wan is a charming mildly above average but experienced  Everyman Jedi) bringing his purple blade and/or the dark saber (cuz why not, we can figure it out - it’s fucking Star Wars, it’s not yet written who owned it at this time - maybe he beats Bo Katan for it) a mandalorian shows up behind him in the holiday special armor (cuz it looks dope af / gorgeously unique and fitting of the time) A shot is fired from the famous phase blaster (same as din djarin has), right through the back of Mace. It’s slowly disintegrating Mace but he feels no pain, the shot is in slow mo - Mace turns to face his assailant. The audience sees the helmet removed and its BOBA FETT - he looks Mace in the eye and says “At last, I’ve revealed myself to the Jedi... (Mace disintegrates completely) at last, i have my revenge).” Music swells, slappin chords of the Boba Fett theme, then suddenly - 

A distorted , exasperated voice from the out of focus “you’ll not be ::hhohh:: collecting a bounty ::prrrr:: this time, Fett.” Boba has raised his eyebrow and turns to Vader as he becomes the focus - his damaged cyborg body rested upright against the wall and his helmet fractured. We hear one last puff from his respirator as he stands up and raises his gloved hand, pointing sternly at Fett. “NO... DISINTEGRATIONS!!!” Immediate cut to stars and credits as fanfare starts.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but Luke does experience a sort of exile from the new galactic government, albeit in the movies it's self imposed. Can't those two ideas be reconciled? 

Jacen/Ben Solo turn to the dark side and eventually become good in the last minute. - Is this really so far off? 

EU, from what I understand, doesn't have a descriptive death of Luke Skywalker. . .  the movies filled that in? (Could've been better, though.)

Lastly, all the events that weren't depicted in the movie and are great stories within the EU (Yuuzhan Vong War, Thrawn trilogy, rise and fall of Luke's Jedi Academy, the Skywalker and Solo families) weren't necessarily contradicting stories presented in the sequel trilogy, just complementary in a very rigid way. 

As in, just because it wasn't depicted in the movie, doesn't mean that those EU contents were necessarily contradicted. 

Do you guys think that EU and canon can be reconciled?

I've seen mention of a ""Crystal Crisis"" arc, but searching for it takes me to the same scenes.  Is there somewhere else I should be looking?"
0,"*Spoilers for The Clone Wars*

We assume there will be a lot of time with Kenobi brooding alone and thinking about what he's been through and there's two scenes I would love to see happen.

The first is a flashback scene to Obi-Wan's time spent with Satine, with Bo-Katan in it too.

Second is a scene with Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahoska discussing the events of the Mortis arc. 

We know Obi-Wan and Satine lovers but I think it would help to see them while they were together. This would make rewatching the Mandalore scenes in The Clones Wars even more meaningful and help explain why Kenobi is so depressed after Order 66 (one of many reasons). I would also like to see a de-aged Katee Sackhoff playing a younger Bo-Katan because why the hell not. She has her scars from Mandalore too and this could help viewers empathize with her in whichever future shows she appears in. Maybe she makes some sassy remark to Satine and Obi-Wan or she actually be confrontational depending on when it takes place.

For the second (and more important scene), I want to see Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka kick some ass then talk about what happened on Mortis. There were rumors/leaks about a possible Clone Wars era flashback and I think this would be a great choice for it. The three characters are the only ones who were aware of what they went through on Mortis and they never talked about it again, as far as we know.

This would take place in either season 4 or 5, after the Mortis arc but also before Ahsoka leaves the order. She would, of course, be played by either a de-aged Rosario Dawson with a younger body or just a younger actess altogether (but I'd prefer a de-aged Rosario). 

The scene would be Anakin and Obi-Wan arguing about something then Ahsoka chimes in, reminding them about what happened on Mortis. She would be frustrated that they won't talk about it and keep pressing them. Anakin and Obi-Wan would roll their eyes at first but then give in and fianlly talk about it. Maybe they're destroying some battle droids before the conversation.

Just like with Bo-Katan, this scene would help develop the guilt Ahoska feels and it could tie into her series.

This gives us our Clone Wars flashback scene, while also bringing attention to an important storyline. MOST importantly though, showing them talking about the prophecy of Anakin falling to the dark side (more or less) would help convey the guilt that Obi-Wan feels about Anakin."
0,"So I just rewatched all the prequels and original trilogy in chronological order. Honestly, it might be because I’m stoned. But I found Phantom Menace to be terrible. Attack of the Clones was solid and revenge of the sith was really enjoyable. I thought that New Hope was good, Empire Strikes Back was amazing and found Return of the Jedi really disappointing. 

I was pretty disappointed with the original trilogy and pleasantly surprised with the prequels.

On a wide note what are the other must watch canon shows? I’m old enough that I remember when there were only three movies but everyone has always raves about the Clone Wars series(I was just unable to watch it at the time. Adulting).

1,"After months of binge-watching TNG I finished season 7 today, I don't think I've ever been this sad to end a series. Picard is the role model I never knew I needed and the rest of the cast feels like family.

It was a long, but beautiful journey with some episodes leaving me in tears, and others giving me cramps from laughing too much. Watching the characters progress was like watching people close to me and each character brought me joy in their own way. I already miss the bridge crew and their personalities. 

I watched the first episode of DS9 to try to make the goodbye easier, but every time Picard or the Enterprise was on screen my eyes would swell up again. It's amazing how fictional characters can mean so much to a person. Knowing that the actors are still friends today brings me comfort, but it'll be a while before I can truly enjoy DS9 as I'm still clinging to the TNG cast.

It definitely shaped me and I'm so grateful to everyone who was involved in making the wonder that is TNG."
1,Or at least give an idea of what they think of each other.
1,"10: Star Trek IX: Insurrection. I didn’t understand the plot all that well, the final battle was...‘interesting’.

9: Star Trek I: The Motion Picture. Slow, very slow. the plot is pretty straight forward, but it probably would have been better as show (which is what it originally was supposed to be)

8: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Okay, I &amp;amp; V almost hit 9, BUT, I believe that this movie was pretty straight forward, the plot was...fine, I guess? But the thing I liked about it, was the fact that Spock (Spoiler Ahead!) &amp;gt;!had a half brother!&amp;lt;.

7. Star Trek VII: Generations. I don’t have much to say about this movie, other than I didn’t like the Nexus thing, I understand it, I just don’t understand how it changed the destruction of the Enterprise.

6: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. This is by far the best uneven numbered Star Trek film, it would’ve made #5, but I enjoyed the next film a little bit more

5: Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. This movie is weird, like very weird, if you like weird, you’ll enjoy this quite a bit. The best thing about this movie is the comedy, this is probably the funniest Star Trek movie made.

4: Star Trek VIII: First Contact. This movie gives an origin story to basically Star Trek, the plot is good, but the only thing keeping it from the #3 spot, is the lac of an original character.

3: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. This is arguably the best Star Trek film. The thing keeping it from one of the top 2 spots is ‘forgetting who was in the original episode’ (Space Seed), at one point in the movie, Khan says to Chekov: “I never forget a face.” The thing is, Chekov wasn’t in the episode, in fact, Chekov didn’t even show up until season 2. Other than that, this would, and should share the #2 spot

2: Star Trek X: Nemesis. I’m not gonna lie, I love this film, I just finished watching it about 20 minutes ago, and I really like it, is it better than II? No, absolutely not. The thing that makes me like it more, is (Spoiler Ahead!) &amp;gt;!Picard’s clone, and how it shows how the same person could turn out.!&amp;lt;

1: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered County. This was a great ending to the original cast’s story. The story about the Klingons capturing Kirk, and putting him on trial, and then putting him and McCoy in the mines. I stand by this being my favorite Star Trek film, and none of you can change that.

I’m interested to see y’all’s ranking of the Star Trek movies!"
1,"Ok so let me preface everything I'm about to say with this so if there's no confusion, I understand why this VERY MINOR plot hole exists.  They didn't know exactly where they were going to go with the series right from the start thus the information we're giving at the beginning of the series which is a lot of about our characters backstory up till that point might not fully mesh with information we're giving later when the series had really gotten into its stride.  I love next generation it is my favorite show of all time and I think that Data in particular is a phenomenal character.

I will also say I'm sure many of you have made the same observation I'm new to this subreddit.

With all that out of the way let me make my point.

Ok so early in the series it is established that when Data was discovered people were unsure of his origin and this is reaffirmed several times throughout the series, what is often discussed alongside this is that he was a particular point of interest and study of many starfleet scientists.  Now it is not until during the series that Data discovers his origins to be that of a Soong android.

Now this is the obvious backstory and information we all know because that's what the series shows bluntly but what's never fully explained is why the hell did no one notice he was a soong Android based off the fact that he looks exactly like doctor Soong.  Soong was a renowned cyberneticist who was trying to create a positronic brain why on Earth would people who are studying the successful creation of such a thing not be aware of the person who famously got closest, and why would they not go back and look at his work and maybe a picture of the guy."
1,If so I would buy the shit out of that.

Data starts a relationship with a woman from a newly discovered planet. But what does she really want?  Why she is really there? And is Data ready for the consequences?"
0,My friend says so but i think he is rather good (not matching him with legends sith like Darth Revan btw)
0,Because when Barry accidentally killed Cisco's brother and changed Diggle's child's sex in the 3rd season of Flash they got angry at him and when Rey thought she accidentally killed Chewbacca they didn't get angry at her and didn't blame her at all. Everybody who was angry at Barry was an idiot in my opinion
1,"Enterprise S4 Ep15.

I am loving seeing James Avery as a Klingon. That’s all"
0,"After watching the Clone Wars, I have a much better appreciation for Revenge of the Sith (though I’d especially now be interested in seeing what an extended 4 hour version would show). But, could Anakin have been restored like Maul if taken to Dathomir or was Maul only able to be made whole again because 1.) he was from Dathomir and/or 2.) because he obtained his original physical change by the Dark Sister’s magic? 

I don’t think Sideous would have entrusted his apprentice’s care to any remaining Dark Sisters after Mother died, but it’s something I thought about as I watched Vader being “built” at the end of RoS. 

But not only was the Clone Wars beyond fantastic, it really fills in the gaps between Episodes II and III."
0,"I was pretty young when the Prequels came out, and I had always thought that there were different actors cast for Obi-Wan. Long story short, I was blown away when I learned that it was the same Ewan the whole time. Beards can truly change a man."
0,"For years I never understood why this movie was so beloved. People treated it like the second coming of Christ, and I just never saw it. I thought it was a decent movie, pretty ambitious, and of course brilliantly made. But the characters never connected with me, and I found most of it to be pretty boring.

I decided to finally rewatch it last week (doing an entire Star Wars marathon to prep for Mando, which I haven’t seen yet) and I actually really enjoyed it. “Boring” isn’t the word I’d use anymore. I didn’t pause it once, I had a great time with it.

Now let me be clear: I still don’t think it’s perfect. I have basically every flaw I had with it in the past. The characters aren’t very interesting, Tarkin looks bad, Vader doesn’t really need to be in it at all, and it tributes the OT way too much. But I stopped viewing this as a stand alone movie, and started viewing it as a Star Wars fan film… and I think it’s the best Star Wars fan film ever made.

That’s not a dig at the movie at all. It’s a movie made with love and passion for the franchise, and Edwards wanted to take this mystical world and view it through a grittier, more larger grounded lens. My investment in the story was entirely dependent on my love of A New Hope (my favorite SW film) but when I factored that in… I had such a good time.

It works really brilliantly as an extension of the Star Wars universe. But it’s not a great introduction to it. And that’s totally cool. It’s a Star Wars movie for Star Wars fans, and accepting it as that, I totally dig it."
1,"Ive noticed a few people are on their first watch of the 90s series so wanted to warn. 

Im just doing a ds9 rewatch and i had forgotten how efficient dominion transporters were. They could reach several light years. The federation recovered a dominion ship mid series and even gul dukat in 2375 had access to one. The tech was all over cardassian space at the end of the war as well.

The federation had 800 years to advance their transporter technology far beyond that. But even assuming not a single advancement in 700 years the tech of 2375 was enough - so why couldent the federation function just as well without warp. Andor / Vulcan is closer to earth than Terok Nor is to Empok Nor so maintaining a chain link style transporter based federation would be entirely possible- the only reason ships were used to transport goods and people was because 23rd and early 24th century transporter tech was localised.  

By the 25th century all the major powers especially commerce based ones like the ferrengi alliance would have entire networks of transporters that just materialise anything  within the range of the entire federation and allied powers - 8000 light years in first contact (probably far larger by the 2900s) 

If anything starships by the 2600s - 2900s would be only for defence and science as they no longer function for the transport of good or sentients. So why was the burn such a hindrance? 

Actually just thinking a species voyager encountered could beam 35000 light years in 236? and the cube in Picard had the same tech undamaged in a central chamber that crashed on a world protected by the federation in 2399. Are they really not going to study a crashed cube?  

Is there an explanation i missed or in one of the comics or dvd ect that explains why the federation couldn't function without ships? Actually it was just dilithium so what about other tech like slipstream or bajorian solar sails - that thing hit warp 4 or 5 i think. 

Forget the solar sail thats kinda silly and might only work in between certain systems but what about the transporters? And other techs we have seen. I just dont buy the end of dilithium causing the collapse of the federation."
1,"I know Disco gets a lot of hate some warranted but mostly not imo, but at the very least we can all appreciate the vfx on the show. I just started to watch DS9 so looking at the two in terms of visual effects is astonishing. The leaps and bounds in vfx where a TV shows effects can comp are to any movie (Star Trek or otherwise) is something we should as all Trek fans be excited about.

1,"Much as I wish the show had a nice HD remaster, it actually looks pretty good. It's really well shot and the makeup and VFX are certainly better than early TNG, so I really don't mind. 

Also, do we ever get a Morn episode? No spoilers please, but I'd love that!"
0,"Too me the best thing of the sequels was Han Story.

So I think it getting to see Han Solo wars in his new republic gig would be cool. We didn’t get to see Han Solo, Leia, and Luke [together](https://imgur.com/gallery/9zzVHBN) in the sequel trilogy however the Mandalorian presents an opportunity and I hope we get at bare minimum a scene."
1,"Since this whole fiasco started and people started talking about ""Q"" I can only picture Jon De Lancie having a go at humanity. 

He would pull something like this!"
0,"I know this has been done a lot before, but it is fun and I am pretty sure mine is the best one there will ever be. These are going to be mainly small changes and a sprinkle of larger ones. Please know the movie abbreviations, I will be using them a lot. In this post I will be only doing the TFA, and depending on how y'all like it, I will post the changes for the other two. Know that, unlike Disney, I have this whole thing planned out, and if something doesn't exactly make sense, I will most likely address it in a later date.

Ok first the TFA. This movie will have the fewest amount of changes, but it will be setting up the plot points in the next movies so it will feel like everything wasn't just being thrown in there last minute. First off, the First Order isn't going to be as big as it in the canon, I think it is far more realistic if the two sides are more evenly matched and it isn't a redo of the OT. Now, it will still be pretty goddamn ginormous, but they aren't the controlling force in the galaxy (yet). Everything will play along normally until the scene with Rey on Jakku. Ok, what I am going to do is simple, I will make Rey have the force, but like, from the beginning. She won't really understand it, she just knows its a power she has. And she will use it, when she is scavenging the fallen Star Destroyer she will be using the Force to look for some metal. She isn't going to be extremely powerful, just strong enough to use it with her in her every day life. I think this is believable, as kids having the force is normal until the Jedi Order takes them away, but since Jakku is nowhere, she wouldn't have been picked up by a Jedi. Then, when she sits down to have her food (before she meets BB8) she will see Kylo. Before I go on, I will be making her connection with Kylo a natural thing, not influenced by Snoke in any way. I think it is interesting having some mystery behind things, similar to the birth of Anakin Skywalker (until we find out later that some Squidward Sith was behind all of it). So, Rey and Kylo will see each other, it will be really brief. Kylo appears in front of her without any trace of traveling in the sand nor the Jakku sun upon him. And Rey will appear to Kylo sitting down in the middle of a hallway being strangely covered in a mystical desert glow. They will blink and check their eyes, then the next time they look, they will no longer be there. That is it, since they have no idea who the other person is, they will just assume they are hallucinating.

Then the story will go on until they meet Han and Chewy. First off, I'm removing the bit with Han and Chewie still being smugglers. They were war heroes for 30ish years, them having no change to themselves is makes no sense. Finn, Rey, Han and Chewie will be talking and Rey will passively force pull an apple to herself or something. Han will be mildly surprised and Rey will ask why. Han recognizes the force and knows what it is, but he doesn't really understand it. He will give his best shot of explaining the force to Rey but the explanation will be pretty awful. The story goes on until the First Order appear at Maz's palace place. There will only be some minor tweaks here but Kylo will use the force to locate Rey, who is in that jungle. Then, he will go completely berserk getting himself there. This will be my moment to show the Kylo is actually pretty strong. He will be doing flips with his saber, summoning lightning from the sky kinda like Thor, and maybe shooting fire out of his palms, I don't know. I want to have some new force powers. It gets kinda dull when the force can only do really specific things.

They story goes on until Kylo interrogates Rey. Kylo will look into her mind, then he goes deep trying to find the specific moment of her looking at the map to Skywalker. But then suddenly, he realises this isn't her mind anymore, it is his. Their connection is somehow reflecting their minds. And Kylo is looking back on his own memories. Maybe him being taught to handle a saber, Chewie teaching him to fly, or C3PO reading him a book or something. Then he will snap and stutter back. I think it is pretty stupid they Rey can reflect Kylo without any training, him being reflected by a mysterious power is much more believable. Then he will go to Snoke and ask him about it. Snoke will say, ""Even after countless millennia, no one *truly* knows anything about the force. Some say, it has a will. Mysterious things happen my young apprentice, such as the fabled birth, of Darth Vader (imperial march plays in the background). If what you say is true, then this girl may be dangerous to our cause. Bring her to me.""

The story continues until Kylo vs. Finn and Rey. I had the scene with Kylo being OP because I needed a scene with him being powerful, this won't exactly be that. First off, Kylo is going to do the same military tactic of punching himself to relieve his wound. But he will still suffer from it. Kylo will knock out Rey and battle Finn. Kylo does a twist-off a disarms Finn of the lightsaber, he brings his saber down, but this time, Finn jumps back and dodges it. Kylo knowing he is slow and wounded doesn't try to walk up and kill Finn, instead, he puts out a hand, and shoots out lightning. But this will be slow, less-powerful, torture focused lightning. Kylo yells ""TRAITOR"" as Finn is getting shocked. But then, the lightsaber will come out of the snow, interrupt the flow of lightning and come into Rey's hands, like in the original. Kylo and Rey will fight as they normally do, until the point where Rey chops up Kylo. I think it is silly knowing that an un-trained Rey can beat an experienced swordsman, handicapped or not. Instead, Rey takes two steps back, and channels all of her energy into her palms, and unleashes a powerful push with the force. Kylo is lifted off his feat and falls back, giving time for Rey to take Finn back to the Falcon, where they then assist the resistance in blowing up ~~the Death Star~~ Starkiller base. Rey will then go with Chewie and R2 to find the legend that is Luke Skywalker, war hero, beacon of hope, and Jedi grandmaster.

That concludes my changes to TFA. What we have done is establish the connection between Rey and Kylo, make Snoke sound smart, establish that Rey isn't a Mary Sue, and establish that Kylo is indeed a powerful foe. Hope y'all enjoy."
1,"The Romulans are descended from Vulcans who rejected Surak's teachings and left the home world. Vulcan emotions are overwhelmingly powerful, and volatile, but their emotion-embracing cousins are never shown as being helpless to control their passions. Unless they're completely insane. But even someone as deeply traumatized as Nero (AOS 2009) was still patient, cunning, and perfectly coherent until his situation became desperate.

So how exactly did they bring their emotions down to human-level intensity and controlability?

One thing I remember reading was that the Romulans had purged their race of all telepathic abilities -  considering what happened on the Enterprise when Sarek was suffering from Bendii Syndrome (TNG s. 3, ep. 23 - ""Sarek""), I think that's a perfectly reasonable course of action.  Vulcan telepathy seems like far more trouble than it's worth.

And one Romulan officer's interactions with Geordi (TNG s. 3 ep. 7 - ""The Enemy"") show a strong Social Darwinist mindset as well. So the Romulans might very well have some sort of wacky eugenics program going on."

0,"I've been on a Star Wars binge in preparation for the Bad Batch release next month, and I'm currently watching AOTC. In the big battle in the Arena on Geonosis, 3PO's head and body are separated and R2 decides to fix 3PO. As R2 starts dragging 3PO's head towards his body, 3PO says, ""Now where are you taking me? Oh, this is such a drag."" And when they arrive next to 3PO'S body, he then says, ""Oh, I'm quite beside myself."" 

Anyways, I would like to receive the opinions of the esteemed people of this community on whether or not these lines said by C-3PO are meant as a joke, puns, or intended as something else entirely.

0,"Wookieepedia lists a few, such as the VCX-100, the YV-666, the YT-2400, and the Allanar N3, but the archives seem to be incomplete - even the wiki page says that it needs expanding. I know there are lots and lots more than the half dozen listed on the wiki page. Unfortunately, I'm currently limited to what information I can get from the movies, shows, and wikis, so anything coming from other sources like novels, comics, games, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

In particular, I'm basically looking for a Nissan Leaf scaled up to a starship. I'm looking for something fairly small, preferably something that could be crewed by one or two people (but not the obvious Millennium Falcon, YT-1300f), but have enough space to hold a couple dozen at most. If possible, something with a fairly sleek but almost boxy design, somewhere between an Eta 2 and an Allanar or a YV. But more important than looks is that I don't want it to be something that's particularly significant - I would use the Allanar if it wasn't particularly used by the Empire to transport supplies, or the Ghtroc 690 if it hadn't come from the stupid sequel saga (even more so that it was used by Rey herself) - I don't wanna touch the sequels with a 50 foot pole.

So, put simply, the order of my priorities goes that it has to be in the right size range (small enough to be piloted by a couple people but big enough to carry a dozen or two), then that it can't be something particularly noteworthy to the series, and then that I want it to look fairly decent.

0,"I just finished Zahn’s Legends thrawn trilogy, and I’m wondering how the new canon trilogy he wrote is in comparison to the old one? Will I still get a lot of good ol’ Thrawn in it?"
1,"i'll admit, I giggled a bit with the special effects, but beyond that, it's still a very good series.

Number one thing I liked  about the series was spock. He's the cool calm*logical* partner perfect for Kirk. His little spats with Bones across the episodes This Side of Paradise really cracked his character open, and showed that he wasn't just a robot (it might have taken his ex to drug him to get to to that emotional capable state but oh well). 

Then, in the very next episode, in Devil In the Dark, he starts calling Jim by ""Jim"" instead of ""Captain."" And his emotions continue to get the better of him, even going so far to tell Jim to kill the creature. And Jim says that's the opposite of what he wanted initially. SO GOOD!

And the other main thing I liked is the diversity. Rodenberry was ahead of his time. He had characters of all races and cultures included. Heck, even Khan's crew was diverse. When he started calling out names, I noticed a Spanish, Chinese, and Irish name if I recall correctly. 

I am definitely looking forward to the next seasons and series."

What makes a show truly come alive is all the behind the scenes stuff that you just don't notice; like the shear size of the Krayt dragons body that doesn't get shown on screen, or the care that goes into modeling the Slave 1.

0,Like I understand that Ahsoka Tano was still hunted because of her connection to Anakin. What if a Force user left the Jedi order kind of like Dooku but instead of falling to the dark side and trying to build power they instead went off and became bounty hunters. No longer pushing the Jedi doctrine or anything would the Empire still hunt them down or would they let them go because they arent being a threat the Empires power?
0,This has bugged me for years and in many years of Mat Pat being on YouTube he hasn’t answered this question. Ever knows the joke “I have the high ground.” Joke from Star Wars when Anakin and Obi Wan battle on Mustafar. I need this joke left for dead can every Star Wars fan spam Mat Pat from film theory and answer this question who actually had the high ground and would Anakin serve if he jumped higher. And what would happen if the role was reversed and Obi wan was on the metal thing. Wait there’s more could Obi wan be even able to cut Anakin’s legs off or would that scene be a lot longer.
0,"Hi everyone, especially those Clone Wars enthusiasts!

I am working on a secret project of mine that involves scenes from Star Wars movies, series or any fan-made thing that is good quality.

I would love to find a scene where clone/s (preferably with their helmets off) speak at the same time in a choir-like formation. Basically, I would like to remove the original sound and replace it with a song. For a few scenes, I’d like it to seem that the clones are singing together.

Scenes with just one clone are ok, but I’d love to find one where this criteria is met.

I’m also looking for other scenes, I’ll probably make more posts like this in the future. But here are a few (no need to be Clone Wars, can be any Star Wars content). Thank you very much.

1-A scene where a character (preferably male) faints or seems very tired because they just did something very intense, bonus points if he’s happy for what he just did.

2-Scenes where someone leading the clones makes a “advance” move, something like that jedi did defending Ryloth.

3-Any good quality animation/creation where one or more characters are singing.

4- A scene where someone says something on the lines of “I wasn’t expecting this for months”, “I thought this would’ve taken longer” or something like that.

6- A good motivational speech to troops (apart from the one by General Hux)

7- Best romantic scenes (that are not in the movies, I know those 😂)

8- Best military decission-making scenes

That’s all for now. Thank you again!"

1,"Episode spoilers- 

I'm just baffled by Sisko's decision at the end to make Rugal go to Cardassia with his biological father, instead of letting him go back to his adoptive Bajor family who raised him with love. Seems pretty fucked up and unfair to the kid, who has now been uprooted from his home a second time. It's especially stupid since he's older, like wtf why not plan scheduled times he visits his biological father and they can ease into relationship or something. This poor kid is going to have even more resentment for Cardassians. I understand the father is a victim whose child was kidnapped, but I wouldn't want to violently  uproot my kid for my own sake. There's just so many other potentially better scenarios!"

0,"I recently listened to the incredible Master and Apprentice Audiobook and picked up Dooku: Jedi Lost right after. I ended up really liking it, the prequels never got me that interested in Dooku but in 6 hours my opinion on the man changed. It's a great dive into the character and a great look at a slightly younger Ventress too!  


I did think however the audioplay was a bit sporadic, flashbacks tend to have that effect on me and I would have preffered a better tying up of the plot. But generally I think it's very good. What say you?"

But one thing i noticed was when they realize that theyre still on the holodeck they say “this is not the real commander laforge” right in front of him and then ask him to leave and he goes “sure” and then kinda sadly walks away

I wonder if holo-geordi spent the rest of that episode contemplating his existence or something

Idk it just seemed weird given the subject of the episode to have him look sad as he walked away, maybe im over thinking it"

1,"To be clear: I have a point-by-point argument that TOS is one of the greatest TV shows in history.

My brother has an argument that Gene Roddenberry was actually a time traveler from the future who just wanted to have fun.

That being said, I can also point to dozens of examples demonstrating that Star Trek might be the stupidest show ever created. 

So my question for younger viewers: how do you feel about some of the super-stupid things that happens on TOS? I don’t even mean how everyone speaks English (some kind of hidden universal translator could easily explain that) or how all aliens look similar (Sauron explained that). 

I’m talking about episodes where they come across a planet that is a carbon copy of Earth, which should represent one of the most amazing discoveries of their generation. But after the opening scene, that whole issue is completely ignored. 

Or when Kirk says to aliens: “I can prove we’re not your enemy”. Gives Scotty a call, Scott says nothing helpful, Kirk hangs up, turns to the aliens and essential shrugs his shoulders.

I fell in love with Star Trek as a kid, some none of these things matter to me. But does it matter to you younger viewers? I really am curious."

To me, Luke embodies the kind of guy that’s so far ahead of his peers that he doesn’t have to take himself too seriously. After the big “hallway” sequence, I was expecting Luke to break out into a big, toothy smile and introduce himself to Mando and Pals, maybe even thank him for taking Baby Yoda so far on his own. It makes for a good contrast to the badassery on display just moments ago. Instead he felt like an NPC delivering obligatory “congratulations” dialogue after completing a mildly important fetch quest. 

I realize that much of this comes down to technology limitations - I’m assuming that the poor guy serving as a body double had to stay about as still as possible for the deepfake masking to function properly, but to me that’s just further evidence that a cast change with maybe some good makeup and prosthetics would’ve been a better option.

I've started with TNG on the recommendation of a friend who insists it's the best of star trek (I know nothing so I'm not about to argue this point either way)   


But to the point I've been enjoying the show so far, I'm about halfway through season 1 but one glaring fault keeps rearing its ugly head. Wesley Crusher is completely insufferable (nothing against his actor more so how he's written) It's a miracle they ever let him on the ship and he only ever seems to show up in the story to cause trouble (that the show then has to have him have a hand in fixing so he's no completely iridemable) or generally get in the way of the actual interesting content of the episodes.   


It sounds stupid but I just cant stand these kinds of anti deus ex machina characters that get away with murder on what is supposed to be a tightly run ship. His inclusion in the show is bugging me so much I'm thinking about giving up on TNG if he's a regular reoccurring character forever.

It's obviously an in-progress orgy that was only interrupted when somebody blew a hatch and everyone instantly froze to death.

I guess if you're a little kid watching the episode, you might conclude everyone just got sick and took their clothes off before dying. Maybe they were hot from a fever or something. But obviously any adult watching this will understand that it was an orgy (especially in the context of polywater intoxication).

Was this really in line with 1987 TV syndication standards? Perhaps surprisingly, I don't recall this scene ever being pointed out or creating any controversy before. But yeah, TNG definitely showed an onscreen (frozen) orgy in its second episode. Of course the whole episode is a bit raunchy, but at least the Data/Tasha scene does the usual cut to commercial."

0,"I was thinking about how Jar Jar could return and how much more impressive he would look with new technology and I got to think more about some theories.  Hear me out...

Obi-Wan and Jar Jar meet up sometime during his time on Tatooine.  Maybe Jar Jar was sent by the alliance in an earlier effort to recruit him or ask him for some kind of help.  He most likely stays due to his duty to protect Luke and watch over him as he grows.  Maybe the Empire gets word of this and somehow comes to find Obi-Wan.  They’ll get tangled up with the Empire and some stormtroopers and Hayden Christensen will show up as Vader.  As Jar Jar and Obi-Wan retry to escape Vader, maybe in an effort to hide Luke and continue to keep his real location a secret, Jar Jar will do something unexpected.  Somehow he’ll sacrifice himself so that Obi-Wan can escape with Luke and continue protecting him.  

We later find out, in a post credit scene, that Jar Jar is not dead.  He returns to Lord Vader wearing a dark hood.

Vader: Was your mission a success?

Jar Jar: Kenobi has no idea that meesa still alive.  Or that weesa orchestrating the whole bombad ordeal.

Vader: Excellent... come Jar Jar, we’ve much to discuss.

This will revels that Jar Jar staged his own death so that Obi-Wan wouldn’t suspect him of being a secret sith apprentice to Darth Vader.  A perfect segway into a potential season two?"
1,"I've been thinking a lot about the epsoide ""In the Pale Moonlight"" recently - and the more summaries or conversations I read about this episode, the more I feel like my interpretation of Sisko's final monologue differs from most people's interpretation.

It seems like the majority thinks that Sisko's statement ""I can live with it"" is actually honest and that he then deletes his personal log, because he doesn't need it anymore.
However, I personally believe that his whole monologue - including his claim that he could live with it - is in fact more like a lie that he tries to convince himself of, because he actually *can't* live with it. However, he fails to convince himself of it and he then finally decides to erase the log, realizing that there actually is no way to justify to himself what he did (and after all that was the main purpose of the log). And I think that this is also the reason why he doesn't drink from the glass and instead puts it back on the table - because he realizes that there is actually nothing to drink to.

So my question is: Am I the only one who interpreted the scene like that? Or was I wrong and that is actually the opinion of the majority?"

I also believe that this species along with their 2 branches (the Borg and Synths) were recorded by the Sphere from Discovery and that is why the ""Future Probe"" resembled the synths with the Tentacles and how Control was able to learn how to take over bodies with Nanomachines like the Borg.

Lastly, I believe the ""Machine Planet"" and ""Living Machines"" that evolved the Voyager 6 Probe to V'ger are the Advanced Synths and not The Borg due to the fact that The Borg are still part organic and not completely machine."
0,"Is Obi-Wan a sith? Is the statement 'only a sith deals in absolutes' an absolute statement?

and wanted to weigh in but was prevented by the (seemingly ridiculous?) reputation requirements.

While the answers there give some well-motivated reasons for the phrasing both in- and out-of-universe, I was especially interested by the answers that disagreed with it being an absolute statement.

The consensus among these answers was that 'deals' is somewhat non-descript and as it isn't \*directly\* referring to whether or not the person is an enemy it isn't 'absolute'.

In my opinion this is completely nonsensical, and made all the more frustrating by these people claiming that everybody who thinks the statement is absolute has a poor grasp on the english language.

Obi-Wan says 'ONLY a sith deals in absolutes'. The logic of the statement implies that if you deal in absolutes, you are a sith. It would be impossible for you not to be, because ONLY a sith deals in absolutes. That categorisation is absolute, and leaves no room for interpretation if dealing in absolutes is something you have engaged in. Therefore, by applying this logic, Obi-Wan has declared himself a sith.

It's worth noting the converse is not necessarily true: being a sith does not necessarily mean you must deal in absolutes, as far as Obi-Wan has said. This does not make the statement any less absolute though because if person A deals in absolutes, we can be \*absolute\*ly certain that person A is a sith.

Does anyone else have some interesting interpretations of the phrase?

0,"I have heard conflicting things. One is that the Sith themselves bring imbalance to the force whereas the Jedi bring balance to it.

This would make sense because the Sith essentially see it as a tool they can manipulate and the Jedi connect with it. Also, Luke killing Vader and Palpatine would bring balance this way.

On the other hand, in the sequel movies, Snoke explained to Kylo the stronger he becomes in the dark side, it is only natural that Rey will grow stronger in the light.

This leads me to believe the balance is between the light and the dark, not that the light IS balance in itself. 

So, when one says, ""Bring balance to the force,"" could that mean leave only the Jedi, ensure the power distribution is fair, or either?"
0,"I’m just going to interpret how I think he would have been in Revenge of the Sith since only way I think they could have fixed in in the 2008 series is to have made a Jedi of the week to kill. My basic premise is that GG would have been that he would have taken the place of Count Dooku at the beginning. He’d over power Anakin and Obi Wan who’d only be saved by his ship taking massive damage and him making a tactical retreat. This would establish his threat status immediately while also saving Dooku for later.

Getting almost killed by GG would also make Anakin feel powerless as he couldn’t even beat this force-less cyborg so how’s he supposed to save Padme. Skipping ahead I think the second act should focus more on the Battle on Kashyyyk putting both Kenobi and Yoda there but having Kenobi trying to take out GG while being stalked by him Predator style. At the same time we have Anakin discover that Palpy is a Sith but he tells him that Dooku is on Mustafar with the Separatists. Desperate he goes there to end the war faces Dooku alone. 

At this moment the scene go back and forth between Anakin and Kenobi and their respective duels. GG is mocking Kenobi as though he’s trying to make him submit to the Dark Side like Dooku is doing with Anakin. Both win but Anakin then goes and slaughters the Separatists while Kenobi returns to Yoda. Order 66 happens and Kenobi kills Cody because I’m annoyed there was never anything done with him in Rebels or any extended material. Yoda goes to Coruscant while Kenobi goes to Mustafar and they play out the same. 

This is just off the top of my head so feel free to criticize or offer your own take on how GG would be if he stayed the threat. Looking for an actual discussion more so than “That’s dumb/awesome” kinda responses."
0,"This may have been covered before, so apologies if that's the case.

When Natalie Portman was filming ""Where The Heart Is"" (2000) (not the greatest movie ever made, but not terrible), there's many scenes that were filmed inside a real Walmart (I've read conflicting info as to where the store actually is, and that it also ""has since been renovated into a county judicial facility"", according to IMDb trivia about the movie). The Phantom Menace was being promoted heavily at the time, so images of Portman as Queen Amidala had to be taken down while they filmed the scenes in the store."
0,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I’ve got to honestly admit that I feel intimidated and a bit scared of the community. (And I’m not talking about this specific subreddit or anyone in specific. I’m just talking in general.)

I grew up with the PT and the OT and loved them both equally. Yet I’ve had friends, family, and online community laugh at me and put me down for enjoying the PT.

And now it seems the same thing is happening with the ST vs the EU and it just breaks my heart to see.

Yeah, I prefer the EU because it’s what I grew up with and spent a decade of my life exploring. And I understand many of the complaints the EU fans have towards the ST.

But I also believe that the ST fans have every right to enjoy the ST and I can honestly understand why they prefer it over the EU.

But I think many of us, including myself, have fallen into unhealthy habits and it’s time we make peace with each other in the community.

There have been major aggressors on both sides. Yes, it feels wrong that Disney and Kathleen Kennedy threw out the canon of the EU. It seemed really disrespectful. And on the other side we have Mark Hamill and George Lucas openly expressing their distaste for the way Disney has handled it. But I think it’s time to let this argument go and move forward.

So, to any ST fans out there, I want to apologize on behalf of the EU fans. The ST is just as valid as the EU.

And for any EU fans out there, I would like to ask that the ST fans please respect that we grew up with these EU stories that are heartbreaking to let go of. We just want to see the stories we love respected as well.

Maybe instead of fighting each other, we can merge these two universes together into a larger Star Wars Multiverse where both sides can be enjoyed by so many more people instead of alienating each other.

I realize this post is more for myself, to make peace with the current reality of Star Wars, than it is for anyone else. But maybe some others can find some peace in this post as well.

May the force be with all of us. And may our acceptance of each other bring balance to the fandom"

I am curious. I noticed in all the Star Wars videos that a faction of fans have been spamming the videos about the High Republic. Ultimately, Lucasfilm does nothing about it (probably due to YouTube revenues and such), but I wonder what the goal for fans is.

In my mind, attacking the publishing arm meant for children will damage the brand. I understand people are upset about some choices made, but the clock cannot be turned back. Now they are trying something new with their books and people are not having it. With that said, the spamming has nothing to do with the books. 

Am I overestimating the influence of YouTube? Is this a real problem?"
1,"I don't understand how they went from Worf &amp; co. to some kind of Halo-looking aliens? And their culture is drastically different too, now. I know, TNG improved on TOS' portrayal of the Klingons and it was important, but why'd they have to do *this*? Is there any hope of canon going back to TNG-VOY style Klingons?

I know there are various filler guides for each series, and that the new movies are considered a separate timeline, but I was just wondering if there is a simple abridged guide that covers the entirety of the Prime timeline? E.g. Are all the movies worth watching? Are there seasons or entire series that are skippable?  I know TOS is hugely loved, but I'm not sure how well I will get on with 60s TV haha."

Out of all characters in the Star Wars universes he’s probably come the closest to actually assassinating Palpatine before he “died” in RotJ. Do you have a favorite obscure character?"

So I'm imaging a story where a very good-hearted Jedi wins a fight against a dark side user, but his lightsaber is destroyed in the process. Immediately after the duel, he sees that a village is in danger and desperately needs a lightsaber to protect the village. As he has no other choice, he wields the red lightsaber. Throughout the story we may see that his thoughts and intentions begin in a place of serenity and benevolence, but eventually turn more towards anger towards his adversaries. He would ultimately use the dark side to defeat these adversaries, but where he goes from here is the writer's choice. Does he realize that he has been swayed and put down the lightsaber and try to return to the light? Or does he embrace these new powers and convince himself that he would never allow himself fully to the dark side? Perhaps his conflict between light and dark turns the saber to purple by the end of the conflict.

I'm not the best writer, but if there are any fan fiction writers out there, I would love to read a story that follows these lines."

0,"Now I get why it’s like that, it makes it much easier to view for the audience, it makes complete sense from that standpoint. 

But from a lore standpoint, it’s strange that ships are almost always level with each other, and oriented so the bridge/top of the ship is facing ‘up’.  You would think that you’d see fights where one ship is ‘above’ another ship, or pointing ‘up’ or ‘down’. I know in space there is no up or down, I just mean relative to the other ship. 

I think I read once that it’s imperial procedure that if a ship meets another ship, then the ship that is arriving will reorient itself to match the other ship. No idea if that’s true but it makes sense. 


There’s apparently a star destroyer in ROTJ during the battle of Endor that’s ‘upside down’ compared to the rest of the fleet, but it’s difficult to tell because you can only see it’s underside in a close up"
1,"It was the episode where Data had been receiving a distress signal from a planet covered in volcanos and having earth quakes all the time. In the episode he finds out that the distress signal was coming from this child who was alone on the planet. In the episode they use their technology to stop the volcanos and earth quakes.   


But this kid became very attached to Data. And for whatever reason, I'm assuming the prime directive but I wasn't paying attention to it and the volume was too low to really distinguish the dialogue. For some reason Picard makes them erase the kid's memory of Data and put her back on the planet alone because the volcanoes stopped. I don't understand why they would do that. She could have lived on the enterprise with Data and had a much better life than being left alone to die.   


Did I miss something that said her family was still on the planet or something? I mean if they were it would only make sense that they find the family before leaving her."

Hello, just beamed in :)

When TNG first aired I was around 5yo and from the start was absolutely obsessed. I wanted to live in this world of curiosity, community, and respect. I was a latchkey kid and got to do whatever I wanted after school and what I wanted to do was watch tv. 

I missed DS9 completely and was dissatisfied with VOY at the time. Watch a few TOS episodes and thought it was for ""old people"".

2 years ago i decided to go back and watch the entire franchise. In order of air date. From start to finish. I'm almost done Just finishing up the last 2 seasons of enterprise. (It's a long story.) 

It's a great journey and I highly recommend it. It's interesting bc you get this view of the culture in America at each point in history. You get to see an evolution of ideas, morals, and shifting power structures.

I'll definitely give a full report when I finish.

So far a few things I've noticed:
- TOS the sets and lighting in the show are fantastic! Kirk is also much deeper than I gave him credit for. The triple bromance between Kirk, Spock, and Bones is a favorite part of the show. 
- TNG will forever be ""home"" for me. Picard is always committed to truth and diplomacy when I think ""Star Trek"" for me its TNG.
- DS9 is SO GOOD! Wow! Fantastic story arcs wonderful deep characters,also, Garak is possibly THE most interesting character in the franchise. Also, I love how much Worf gets to grow on the station.
- Voyager too comfortable for me but I LOVE the characters. There are all these wonderful moment. Also, if I'm being honest, I'd want to serve under Janeway before any of the other captains.
- ENT... Ugh... I... I don't want to talk about it...
- Kelvin timeline is super fun and action packed it felt a bit blockbustery but I'm down for the ride.
- DIS is absolutely beautiful, maybe the best looking of all the shows. I love the representation as well. Characters are wonderful and some of the ideas they came up with are super interesting. And let's be honest, you had me at Doug Jones.
- PIC was a fun ride as well, there's a lot going on. Some was not my jam, some was. I need a rewatch for sure.
- Lower Decks - so many references and I'm HERE. FOR. IT.

I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching these shows and movies. Very excited to check out this sub.

And feel free to ask some questions if you'd like."
0,"I know they decided to go with CGI Luke at least for that one scene and personally I’d rather his character be somewhat laid to rest, but if they ever needed to hash out any more Luke stories, I really hope they consider using him."
1,Are there worlds populated by non-Klingons/Romulans that are ruled by those empires? Are they occupied worlds like Bajor was? I think the only clue about the Klingons at least is in TOS when Kirk is telling the Organians they don’t want to be ruled by the Klingons.
1,Obviously every person is different but it seems that K'Ehleyr was much better at controlling her temper than B'Elanna was even though she said she could feel it inside of her just like B'Elanna could. Also K'Ehleyr had much more pronounced facial ridges and darker skin than B'Elanna. I was wondering if writers did this intentionally since gender of parents matters genetically in hybrids like with a mule and a hinny.

1,"Aight so I know it’s potentially just that they wanted to make her look good and it might not be the case for all of their resulting unions, but dang is that Tora Ziyal one fine lookin mamajama!

To explain; I’ve just recently gotten seriously into the Star Trek franchise and I’ve been watching Deep Space Nine. For starters I thought that they would continually have a new race come aboard the station and have to deal with them similarly to how The Next Generation did. I was pleasantly surprised by how detailed DS9 gets with the culture of the Bajorans, Trill, Ferengi, and Cardassians. Learning about the history and lore of these seemingly major players in the universe makes for an amazing show! 

With my general praise for the show out of the way I’d like to say that when it comes to the various aliens of the show I do like for them to appear more ‘alien’ but not too much. Bajorans basically seem human with the exception of their ridged noses (if there is any other difference I haven’t noticed) and Cardassians have so many differences to humans visually that they seem almost insect like to me. But seeing the result of these two species smooshing their respective reproductive organs together makes me hope they can improve relations! It’s like the perfect blend of the two. Just enough differences to show she’s an alien while still having a hint of familiarity with her features that wouldn’t frighten off humans if she were to be the one we made first contact with. 

Now I haven’t seen much of her yet (I’m only on season 4 episode 21 and I haven’t even finished the episode) so I do hope I get to see more of her personality in future episodes! So far she seems to at least have a decent head on her shoulders. She was the one to ask Garak out which shows that she doesn’t expect the man to do everything (a trait I personally love because boy howdy am I shy as heck). She loves her family (even though it’s Dukat) which I believe is important. I will say she doesn’t have to and I wouldn’t hold anything against her character if she did hold some grudge against Dukat for nearly killing her, but she still loves him. 

I know this whole post may seem somewhat excessive for a fictional character, but I love doing these sorts of deep dives/examinations of characters from shows! This has been fun and to those who read through all of my ramblings I thank you. I hope that you and all your loved ones are safe in these bizarre times we find ourselves living through. Stay safe and happy everyone!"
0,"Within the span of a single human lifespan the Old Republic, Empire, New Republic, and First Order all fell.  People's faith in anything but local government will be weak at best.  Criminal syndicates and Warlords will abound, and as far as we know Rey is the onlyJedi, even if she starts training new jedi immediately it will take decades to rebuild thr order.

When Rome fell Europe went through nearly 1000 years of turmoil before the Renaissance.  I would estimate at least 100-200 years before anything close to real stability gains a foothold across the Galaxy."

1,"You can tell that Suzie Plakson had a ton of fun in the role and had an undeniable charisma. She was the Q to Worf’s Picard, and every scene she was in she stole with the heart of a Ferengi. Among characters who appeared in fewer than five episodes she is easily the one who should have been in more the most. I’d be fascinated to hear which characters who appeared in 4 or fewer episodes who deserved many more."
1,"I was watching Equinox part two, and I just rage quit after Janeway relieved Chakotay of his command. She is acting like an absolute maniac in this episode. Like it literally comes off as a different character. They had the other captain remove the doctor's ethics, did they remove Janeway's as well??? I almost quit watching after Tuvix for exactly the same reason. Every once in a while they write Janeway to be an absolute psycho. I have really really been enjoying Voyager other than these two episodes. Like I thought the Fight was a better episode than Equinox, because at least Chakotay was written consistently as a character. Should I continue with Voyager? Are there other episodes like these that I should skip?"

1,"I wonder how the federation would deal with the great tribble crisis.  The klingons would be outraged and would immediately begin the second great tribble purge.  The romulans would probably hire the klingons to help them get rid of the tribbles.  The federation would try to find a humane solution for dealing with the tribbles.  The ferengi economy would probably collapse because they have so tribbles but can't sell them.  The cardassians would probably try to torture the tribbles for information about the q.  That is their thing.  

The borg being impressed with the tribble's ability to reproduce would try to assimilate them and use them to covertly assimilate other planets.  The dominon would genetically engineer the tribbles into more evolved programmed murder machines that eat people.  And reproduce even faster then regular tribbles.  They may even mostly use them to replace the jem' hadar.  

But for the most part it would be a huge mess.  The tribbles would become the scourge of the galaxy and would most likely be driven off inhabited planets by force.  Space exploration wouldn't be same because every planet would have tribbles.  The tribbles would become a plague on the galaxy.  At least they would keep the klingons busy and happy for a long time fighting the empires greatest enemy and their ultimate nemesis.  So what do you think would happen in this scenario?"
0,Officially freaking out!!! I grew up watching these movies when I was a kid! I have no idea what happened to our VHS copies but it’s so awesome to seem the again! My heart is so happy! 🤗♥️
1,"Chakotay was an awful First Officer and when VOY was on the air the fans made that clear, during the first two seasons Chakotay was a primary character, as were all first officers before him, however the fans’ vocal dislike of him gave the writers 2 choices; kill and recast or make him a regular cast member. I wish they had chosen to kill him off, replace him with Tuvok, and ideally add a new regular character.

The problem is not that the concept of Chakotay’s character was bad, it was awesome! A spiritual, former criminal, Native American first officer. The problem is Beltran did a horrible job portraying him. He was unable to bring any depth or emotion to him, he was nearly almost always monotone and when he had to show emotion he was horribly unbelievable. 
Chakotay was so bad that if you asked me what my favorite scene with him was I’d say I don’t have one.

Why the hell the producers cast Boring Beltran to play a character with so much potential is beyond me, I’m very disappointed, if they cast him better Chakotay had the potential to be an incredible primary character.

What do you think? Do you think Beltran got a bad rep and portrayed Chakotay well or that Chakotay was poorly cast and had the potential to be a much better character? Should the writers have done themselves a favor and killed him off, to replace him with a better character?

Harry Kim was also a snooze fest and it’s a shame they chose to fire Kes instead of Harry

[EDIT] added after more thought] The reason Chakotay was always so calm is because he was terrible at acting out more extreme emotions. I watched him try to be angry, sad, distraught, apathetic, depressed etc NOT ONCE was he believable. It was painfully obvious that he was acting anytime he tried to change his emotional tone, he is just a bad actor, plain and simple."

 Because those are all episodic shows that is like a villain of the week type of thing. Only a little of it is serialized and a lot of the main story is not talked about.

 Whereas the Star Wars movies, if you binge watch them it's definitely serialized. So is Clone Wars episodic or serialized? Thanks!!"

0,"Hey guys

I'm gonna be a GM for a Star Wars Tabletop RPG campaign soon (the Fantasy Flight game if you're curious). It's gonna be set around 5 years before the destruction of the first Death Star, so at the point where the Rebels TV show starts. 

I wanted to get a better feel for the world at that time. I'm looking for books that portray life under the Empire at it's height. I'll take anything that matches the timeframe, but I'd be especially glad for recommendations of books that contain depictions of daily life under imperial rule, whether that be from the perspective of traders, simple moisture farmers, smugglers, high society on Coruscant, rebels, whatever. Doesn't have to be the main focus of the book, either. 

Anyone have any recommendations?"

1,"Howdy all, taking a break from attempting to astral projecting back to 1989 to stop Shades of Grey being made to talk about space battles in Star Trek, specifically how part of me misses the way star-ship battles were done in TOS and TNG.

This isn't intended as a hate post, and I completely understand a long drawn-out fight scene would be awkward in every episode. My main peeve is something like the battles in late-DS9, where ships explode left and right. It's very well done and a good climax for the series, but it does feel weird watching ships that could take seven seasons of torpedoes, infiltrations, and anomalies [going down after a few phaser hits](https://youtu.be/P1OP0_rg2Ws?t=138).

Something like the climax to [Wrath of Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCpYqWAIwFA), or TOS scenes like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpSj-8pNHk) are much more exciting to me personally, over battles like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89WcIwjlQxA) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyRxk7gr-DM), partly because you get the sense of how hulking and powerful these ships are, and how brutal a fight to the   death between them can be.

I'm mostly making this post to see what others think about this kind of thing, and feel free to agree or disagree, at the end of the day it's just a space battle."
0,"... I loved the scene in mando but I don't think the technology is there for a whole show of it? It was just about tolerable for a few minutes. Much as I'd love to see Mark back in the saddle I think recasting with his blessing and coaching is the only legit option at this point surely? Unless he's meant to be a lot older, like Grogu could still be pretty young but like could be 10 years older than we saw him after mando season 2...and then have the story end with Grogu off and Ben arriving (if we have to have that continuity) ... I would prefer to distance from but I wouldn't be totally against it either if it was done well."

But the Xindi arc, the expanse, the struggles episode-to-episode and the need to rebuild themselves (or are still damaged) every few episodes, it's got the continuity necessary to tell the story while still being episodically driven. It feels like someone realized how hardcore they wasted the potential of Voyager and were trying to make up for it."

But how could you get a padawan to train while you're still a padawan yourself? I'm not super familiar with Star Wars lore(I've seen all the movies plus the Mandalorian) so there's probably something I'm missing."
1,"I just finished watching the voyager episodes about unimatrix zero, it inspired me for a borg origin theory (just for fun):

The borg was originally a society like humans and developed virtual reality world (unimatrix zero) that allows them to interact online.   
As the population demands to spends more time ""online"", they developed memory uploading, cybernetic and nano technologies. This gave them the ability to control their own body in the real world while they are ""online"".   
The nano technologies could be developed first to prolong their physical body before they were able to upload memories.  
So at this stage,  they still had individuals, and their own body became drones that they can control inside the online world.

When the memory uploading technology was completed, the original borg population became immortals. They might even had a online social structure, where the rich owns and controls many bodies as drones while the poor have single or no body and only exist virtually.  
Over centuries the elites of the immortal borg population continues to gain power, knowledge and pursue perfection, but each time they change themselves for perfection, they left behind things like emotion and empathy. The borg queen could be the current evolution of one of these immortal elites.  
And at somepoint during the borg evolution of ditching emotion, assimiliation technology was created so the elites can gather more power, knowledge and own more drones.  


So in essense, the borg final result of Immortality, Inequality and Virtual Reality.  
This is pretty self reflective of our current society. We are pre borg."
1,"Let me start out by saying that I like this actor in other things other than Star Trek as well as his roles in Star Trek.

I liked DS9 the best, but like most; appreciate and like the other series in the franchise. I did not like the character Weyoun for some reason though. However, he was more comic relief to me because of his death(s). Even though I did not like the character, I can still appreciate the actor because he played his role(s) well. 

I am watching ENT for the first time. For some reason I thought that there were only 3 seasons.

1,"I'm just about to finish watching Voyager from S2 onward linearly. Before this I'd watched the tail end of the series when it aired, then S1 when I got my hands initially on a DVD set, and then a great deal of the show in a more ad hoc fashion via streaming.

However, watching it in order, and in a short period of time, it becomes obvious that there are a lot of character and story arcs, even though the episodes generally aren't serialized. And you know...that actually suits Voyager's premise. They should be having encounters with a planet, then not really running into that group again or having sporadic encounters, and that's pretty much exactly how Voyager works.

But, it's the character arcs that really become evident when watching the episodes in order.

Tom starts out as a dick, initially pursues Kes, becomes the medic, gradually becomes more competent in that role, and him and B'elanna's romance plays out over multiple seasons. It is a point that he doesn't get any letter when Voyager gets the initial message dump, and also a point that he hears from his father when Pathfinder makes contact, a nice bit of continuity.

B'elanna's episodes do tend to be repetitive conflicts over her Klingon heritage, but at least some of them (particularly the episode over genetically altering her daughter to make her less Klingon) are still damn good and pertinent (unfortunately) today. ""When the people around you are all one way and you're not, you can't help feeling like there's something wrong with you."" To be honest, the repetitiveness in and of itself is thematic.

Seven's episodes gradually become less about her learning basic social skills to being forced into a role as a mentor or parent. Her persuasive strategies go from ""You must comply"" to becoming more contextually aware and persuasive. She starts to make witty or wry comments about the Doctor when he's being a little entitled or self-centered and doesn't seem to be aware of it.

The Doctor goes from passive-aggressive whining to having fluent full-throated disagreements with Janeway; the scene in Virtuoso when he argues Janeway into letting him stay on the planet to become a performer, imho, one of the low-key best written and acted scenes in the series because of how unscripted and spontaneous it feels. And eventually he grows into the ECH role and is forced out of his comfort zone. He stops requiring other characters to go to bat for him and goes to bat for himself more often.

Harry Kim, sadly enough, becomes more disgruntled and fed up with being just an ensign over time. I've seen the behind-the-scenes reasoning of ""someone needs to be the ensign"" and it's dumb. But at least by season 6 and 7 the show is self-aware enough to make it a plot point and run with him literally arguing what everybody in the audience is thinking, that he's overqualified for his rank, and give him a chance to do more.

Janeway also feels like she becomes more complex and thoughtful, and just less stiff, than she is initially. Arguments over individuality with her tend to become more reflexive about past character development - eg she let the Doctor or Seven evolve, so why not X. She starts out as a scientist and seems far more at ease at playing the negotiator or being crafty by the end of the series. I don't see S1 Janeway being able to handle Q and Junior with anywhere near as much savviness as she does in S7.

Even though Icheb doesn't really get *that* much screentime, I am much more pissed at Picard now. After watching him and the other Borg children grow over multiple episodes, him getting screwed over by his parents, then taking refuge on Voyager, trying to contribute and find purpose, and connect with Junior. There isn't really anyone else his age on Voyager, and he doesn't have anywhere else to go.

Neelix takes things less for granted over time, going from a kind of sketchy possessive boyfriend who oversells himself, to having an episode where he admits that they've reached the edge of his knowledge, and taking things much less for granted in the episodes after that point.

Even though Chakotay and Tuvok don't get a ton of character development, it kind of suits them. Tuvok of course is older than anybody else, and Chakotay already commanded a starship (albeit a smaller one) before Voyager.

Kes gradually goes from naive to wise, incites the Doctor's early character development, and gradually becoming more confident and competent, even being able to instruct the Doctor in surgery when he begins to forget (in the Swarm iirc).

And then there are incidental background characters, like Samantha Wildman, Naomi Wildman, or Vorik, who pop in every now and then to give the feeling that it's not just the mains and a silent Lt. Ayala in the background of every shot. If anything, Voyager needed more of these characters.

When Voyager runs into species after they've passed through their space, characters remark on them being out of their area of space; there's definite continuity to whether Voyager is near the Kazon, Vidiians, the Borg (to some extent), the Malon (sigh), or the Hirogen.

Kadis Kot and Vulcan Jenga / Kal-Toh also seem to sort of become fads at different points, as real board games do. Ditto for Captain Proton or Fair Haven, or that French bar, which are recurring settings and have their own story arcs of sorts.

Then there's technology, such as how Voyager's crew realizes that taking a ride in a shuttle, especially with Chakotay, is basically suicide. It's especially evident in either S2 or S3, when there's a run of several episodes where every other episode is basically someone going on a shuttle trip where they crash or it gets blown up. Paris eventually remarks that ""class-2 shuttles just don't cut it in the Delta Quadrant"". Prompting them to build the Delta Flyer, which manages to only get completely blown up just once.

The Doctor's holographic imager comes up in a few episodes as well, IIRC, even though it's only a pivotal plot point in Latent Image. The mobile emitter, astrometrics, Borg regeneration alcoves in cargo bay 2, etc. change character dynamics or the feel of scenes and help date episodes.

And of course there's the occasional issue of past characters or groups that badmouth Voyager as an easy scapegoat to avoid culpability, resulting in issues for Voyager's reputation when people reference a past incident from a different point of view.

As far as story arcs, for example, the conflict with the Hirogen is actually pretty serialized across at least two seasons, with Voyager pissing them off by accessing their network, taking the network down while trying to get a message from Starfleet, Arturis trying to use the message to lure Voyager's crew to the Borg, the Hirogen eventually catching up to and capturing Voyager, Voyager trading holodeck technology for their freedom, then dealing with the fallout from the Hirogen abusing the holodeck technology. Each of these are separate episodes in a long story arc, it's just that the story isn't told with back-to-back episodes. The conflicts with the Malon, the Kazon / Seska, the Vidiians, Suspiria and the Ocampa superpowers, the Q, etc can all be seen as multi-episode story arcs. Voyager's past actually catches up with them a *lot*.

So, the fact that a whole season or the whole series isn't a ""Year of Hell"" is not something I'm really upset about. There are enough little bits of continuity to make it feel like a group of people that are growing and changing. There's room for more, like accounting for resources or damage to the ship, or some question of how much Starfleet structure makes sense in the Delta Quadrant, but I'm not sure if pedantic accounting of the ship's dilithium stores etc. would really make for a better show. Even Battlestar Galactica only goes so far in accounting for resources, allotting a few episodes to water, food, fuel, or ammunition, then once it's solved (mostly in the first season) it's usually for good.

If I were to change something, I'd probably prioritize adding more recurring background crew members or passengers to add more variety to the episodes, give the leads more opportunities to explore different facets and relationships of their character, add more real tension when characters are put into danger, and give characters opportunities to join and leave the ship.

If I were to make Voyager's overall plot more like a particular episode, I'd probably choose to focus more on The Void than Year of Hell. The cooperative solution to the prisoner's dilemma there is something that I feel is core to Star Trek. Forming a coalition of people against a common enemy is easy. Doing it without a common enemy when everyone needs the same resources and the people with the most vital ones are the least ethical is hard. Having to decide where to draw the line in that situation is a hard call for which there isn't necessarily a right answer.

But overall, I think Voyager does a very good job of balancing accessibility and continuity."
1,"This has been bothering me about ST:Picard every time I stop to think about it... The writers were aware there were more 'synthetics' in the Federation than just Soong-type androids, right?

Holograms are synthetics too and there exists at least one sentient hologram, The Doctor (has he called himself Joe yet?). The Romulans in Picard didn't seem to particularly care what *form* a sentient AI took, but seemed lazer focused on Soong-type androids in the series even though holograms were more than obviously ever present.

While I get the focus of Picard was to highlight the relationship between Picard and Data, ignoring Holograms seems to be a huge oversight! Voyager had at least a handful of episodes showing sentient Holograms (even beyond the Doctor). If the Romulans were so against sentient AI, they would have attacked holograms as well (causing Star Fleet to have included them in the ban). I find this especially irritating as they bright 7of9 into the show! If this was going to be a fight for the rights of synthetics to exist, then how much better would it have been if, while Picard was trying to find/save Soji, Seven was trying to find/save the Doctor as well! 

Even if you want to say sentient holograms are somehow different when speaking of ""synths"" than Soong-type androids are, at least acknowledge this in some fashion! Humans are hypocrits all the time, especially about exclusion of races, so, fine, Holograms are safe... at least bring that up. Make a case for Soong-types to be a greater threat.

I think, as I write this out, it's the fact they don't even *mention* Holograms when talking about synths in Picard... and here's Rios treating HIS holograms very much like Voyager did the Doctor at the very start of the series, and that was the Doctors whole arc for seven YEARS! COME ON!!!

I think that could make a good show and they could make 2/3 seasons out of that and it would be about them running and Ashoka accepting what happened and maybe it could follow Lux bonterie and they could fall in love or something and she could meet up with Cal Kestis from fallen order and Ghost Squadron.

But the Jedi commanded the largest slave army in history with the Clones who were sentient beings bred for war with little freedom or choice. Millions of clones lived and died for a war they gave no consent in fighting, and due to growth acceleration those clones were all ages 10-11 when they graduated. I know that growth acceleration means that physically they're older, but it can be argued that we don't know if they're mentally adults because experience and time make for adulthood. 

I. The Clones have no choice in fighting, if they desert they get executed.

II. The Clones are at average, 10-11, we can assume that in some form they are still children.

1,"The other week I tried to make a thread here about how I feel so depressed about the world and how we need positive Trek in a world that seems like it's burning. I started to turn to Star Trek to feel a bigger love for humans again and I've landed on Voyager, the same show my late father and I watched as a kid. Despite its deep issues it still has the heart of Trek and parades a humanistic spirit that I think we all need right now, when things are so scary and everyone hates each other and pregnant women are being attacked for where her ancestors were born. 

I just watched an episode where the Doctor has a hologram family to learn about humans and his holo daughter ends up dying. He decides rather than facing it to simply end the program. Tom Paris while in the medical bay gives a beautiful speech to the doctor on shared human pain and how it brings us closer together and that because something is painful doesn't mean it's not worth experiencing despite its awfulness. 

During a time when we've all lost so much I think it's something we can all learn from in these times. I hope that doesn't sound callous in the face of the very real pain others have experienced the last year. I lost my father, but others have lost more, and I know that by facing it together we can come out stronger. What a message. That positive, wistful hopefulness. Trek, your star has never shined brighter for me. 

What beautiful comfort food for the soul. It's not a perfect stew but it's still worth eating. I think it's something we all need right now."

Then back to seeing people leave....

Just seems that it would have flowed much better together without the whole scene as it's just abrupt and in the middle of everything, kind of like they just crammed it in there.  Also I find the whole pah wraith angle kinda pointless, it doesn't really accomplish anything.

0,"It’s strange to see people rate the movie so highly, especially when this is the barebones of a trilogy that’s already been considered a total botch. The first two movies were heavily CGI, green screened, poorly written and acted movies with no real character development or development in the story. With 2 already failed films, you’d expect to hold no hope for their sequel, yet some people consider episode 3 to be one of the greatest, if not THE greatest star wars film of all time. 

Rewatching this movie, I noticed it still follows many elements of the previous 2 films in it’s formula. It still uses a lot of CGI and green screen, arguably the most out of any of the films. It also still has some pretty terrible lines and acting from the cast though I think Ewan Mcgregor’s performance was at his strongest in this film. Honestly, the only saving grace of this movie, to me at least was it’s 3rd act. Having Yoda and Sidious with their own showdown was a brilliant choice by George Lucas, since it’s the first time you have 2 great actors actually act against each other. And I can admit the actors got a bit better with their acting ability after this film, I think Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman did improve, most likely because they tried to improvise more instead of being told what to do by Lucas."

Fourth Entry: Star Wars Ep 3 Review

""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"": Star Wars

And it was a long time ago when Star Wars was a fantastic film. Until, that is, in the year 1999 George Lucas decided to bring forth the long-awaited prequel The Phantom Menance. Torn apart by critics and old-school fans alike, TPM was too much politics and not enough Star Wars. The combination of Lucas's non-abilty to write and direct and bad choices for actors led tho TPM's demise. The only redeaming factor was the most hard-core lightsaber battle to date between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jin, and Darth Maul. If it is one thing Lucas can do right, it is make awesome lightsaber battles.

However, the laughable plot and emotionless characters made TPM a real dissapointment. Due to Lucas's desire to make his movies mostly Computer Generated instead of the costumes and models that gave the original trilogy its realism, the movie just seemed, sadly, like just a movie. To me and many other fans alike, the original Trilogy seemed very real, very life-like and the actors' ability to perform their lines made A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi more like documentries instead of films.

George's 2nd attempt at ""revising"" the series came with the horribly named 2nd prequel film; Attack of the Clones. Not to be mistaken with fan's long awaited battle, The Clone Wars (something we have heard and waited for ever since hearing about it from Alec Guiesness in ANH), AOTC was much better than TPM, but that is not saying much. While Hayden played anger rather well, his other emotions made him seem very whiney and bratty. The relationship between Obi-Wan and Anikan (which you would guess would be a very close bond considering Obi-Wan being so saddened when talking bout Anikan to Luke in ANH), was nothing but a battle of wits. You could see that Obi-Wan and Anikan disliked, if not hated, one another. The love scenes between Anikan and Padme were decent in my opinion, and the acting was just as terrible as TPM. This film would have been much better if Lucas had a differnt director to get the actors into the film more, but alas, he did not. Again, Lucas went with Computer Graphics over costumes and this was very noticable during the lightsaber battles. The fighting against CGI beings was very sloppy. The actors just swung their weapons without looking at their enemies and when deflecting lasers, they just swung around (Unlike Luke in Return of Jedi when he actually made it look like he was swinging at the lasers instead of air).

Again, Lucas waited until the last 10 minutes of AOTC to give fans a reason to see the movie. The Yoda vs Dooku scene was bloody awesome. Though Dooku is no where near as intimidating or interesting as Darth Maul (my personal opinion is that Dooku should have died in Ep 1 and Maul should have stayed for 2 and 3).

Don't even get me started with showing how Boba Fett looks like without his helmet....*snarls*

Than, about a year after Clones came out, Lucas decided to release a Micro-Mini-Series (that translates into 5 minute long episodes) of the Clone Wars. The animation was laughable at best, the voice actors as dry and unbelievable as the real actors themselves, and only long enough for the fans to realize they hated it and turn off the TV, The Clone Wars is the biggest cop-out in Movie History. Instead of putting time, money, and actual effort into the biggest, most hard-core war in the Star Wars Saga, Lucas had these piss-poor animators give us a chibi-sized series. I mean, yes, it was neat seeing Anikan get bad-ass, but it wasn't enough. The sound was aweful and 3PO was turned into a homosexual instead of it just being an old joke. When he disrobed for Anikan to show off his new body and they played stripper music? WTF?

But on May 19th, my birthday, I gave George his very last chance with Episode 3, the Revenge of the Sith. The only reason I gave him the benifit of the doubt was because long time Star Wars fan and Ep 1 and 2 hater Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) gave it the thumbs up. Don't get me wrong, I would have seen it without his opinion, but trust me, it helped.

Revenge of the Sith was a beautifully made movie. Although the first 5 minutes were the slowest in Star Wars history (The sound and music didn't match the intense battle going on. It didn't drag you into the war), the fight between Anikan and Dooku was the most shocking fight in Star Wars history. George finally brought Anikan and Obi-Wan closer together and made their friendship more pronounced. Gone was Jar Jar (for those who didn't like him. I did) and the acting was much better. The main characters finally got into their roles (took them long enough) and the emotional shyt Anikan was going through was very belivable. I really sympathized with him. Palapitine was just as maniupulative and if you can believe it, even more sadistic than his previous appearences. Mace Windu was eh as usual. Always trying to be TOO bad-ass in my opinion during this movie. Yoda was animated even better and I honestly forgot he wasn't there at times. The final battle was bloody amazine and I wasn't dissapointed at all in this movie, which, comming from me, means a lot. However, this movie is still nothing compared to the original trilogy, but it is a close 2nd.

I give it 8 out of 10. ^.^

************************************************************************************************************
The Following contains huge spoilers. If you don't want to know certain scenes, stop reading now.










What I liked

Likes:
The Light Saber battles: More realitistic. Still sloppy when blocking lasers and attacking the driods, but the timing has improved 10 fold.

The Humor: Anikan, Obi, and R2-D2 were hilarious. There were many scenes (like in the elevator shaft when Obi-Wan wakes up dangling from Ani's leg) where I was laughing tears. I missed the light humor that was pronounced between Han, Leia, and Luke in the original trilogy

The Intesity: OMG! What Ani did to Dooku was the most hard-core scene EVER! And what he did to the kids, I had never though Vader to be that cruel. Plus the downfall of Anikan, when he is turning darkside just to save his wife, by the gods, the emotion was so rich and powerful, it was heart-wrentching. Vader started out doing this to save his wife and son but turned utterly evil in the process. Beautifully written George. Bout time!

The relationship: Ani and Obi-Wan were so much closer this time around. They were bickering but very brotherly, very father/son. I was very pleased.

The Ending: The fight of Yoda and Palpitine and Anikan and Obi-Wan was powerful. Obi-Wan's final speech to Anikan as Anikan is burning up was heartbreaking. The tears in his eyes looked real and you could feel his pain at this betrayal.



What I disliked:

The battles: Lucas should have made the Clone Wars movie. Because he didn't, we missed out on how bad-ass Grevious was and how cruel Dooku was. The Wookie War, the battle between Grevious was TOO SHORT! Not even 5 minutes. You see the wookies start the war and then BAM it is over. That was it! If he added another 30 minutes (yes it would be 3 hours but who cares!) and added to the battles, i would have been very happy.

Grevious: General Grevious. I have seen him fight in the Clone Wars cartoon and I was very excited for him to fight in this movie. He was very evil and was a genius. I loved when he tore open the window of his ship to escape into space. Very well done. However, he died in a 2 minute battle. It was kinda a cop-out. The big lightsaber battle I was looking forward too (since he fights with 4 sabers) was reduced to him cutting apart the floor before his hands got lopped off. It was sad. If you wanted to see Grevious battle, you had to see the cartoon which, George is you read this, IS A COP-OUT and George has cheated the fans horribly.

Mace Windu's death: Sam Jackson had in his contract to have one of the best deaths in the movie. While his death by Palpitine was nice, it wasn't as hard-core as I expected it to be. But damn did he suffer.

The Names: How the names Luke, Leia, and Vader came to be was horrific. Palpitine pulled the name Vader out of his ass and when Padme was giving birth it was like this:

while Padme is screaming and panting due to labor

""It is a boy. What shall he be called?""
AHH! Ahh! Luke!""
""It is a girl. What shall she be called?""
(Same as above. Replace Luke with Leia)

I would have liked to see Anikan and Padme talk over names. Just a bit to know why she chose the names, same with Palpitine. I don't like how these names were just pulled out of everyone's ass.

The Ending: Okay, so I said I liked the end. I also hated it. We have all scene the trailer where Vader rises on the platform in his suit. That was awesome. Hearing him breath for the first time was awesome, but when he found out Padme died and ripped himself off the table (looking like a black sci-fi version of Frankenstien) and screaming out ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"" while waving his arms dramatically...WHAT THE F*CK?! I couldn't believe that hard-core Vader, the man who destroyed his daughter's planet, who chopped off his son's hand, who slaughtered the entire Jedi Order, started his career like a little bitch screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. *sighs* That was horrible

1,"My brother and I recently discussed this and I figured I’d get other peoples as well.

For me it’s is

Captain: Toss up depending on mission type.

Picard for diplomatic 

Janeway for exploration and first contact

First officer: Riker cause you gotta have the original Number One (I cannot stand the bastardization of the title in Discovery. Pfft an Ensign for First office 🙄.)

Tactical: Worf just cause he’s Worf

Operations: Seven I mean come on she would be the best with all that borg knowledge wrapped up inside.

Science: Jadzia because before he I never really knew there was a science officer.

I’d have to have Data as well but not really sure where I’d put him but conn/operations

Engineering: Chief would be La Forge but O’Brien and Torres senior engineering staff

Chief Medical Officer:The Doctor cause he was the best IMO

I don’t think this has been done or asked before, so just a bit of fun today."
1,"It's been years since I watched TNG, and when I was asked for my favorite episodes I suddenly realized... I couldn't remember all of 'em!

Of course, I love ol' Jean-Luc and *Chain of Command* has to be way up there at #1 or #2... but I remember one episode I loved (perhaps idiosyncratically) maybe more than any other revolved around Data. 

Can't remember too many details, other than 1) it involved some outside power or alien species attempting to fuck with the Enterprise in some manner, and b) Data essentially single-handedly steps up and saves everyone.

 I *think* by the episode's climax, he's essentially alone in being able or willing to function and fight back, but I'm not 100% sure about this. 

Ring any bells for anyone...?"
1,"I actually like it but it’s hard to watch at times because it requires sooo much time to be invested from one episode to the next. 

All the previous treks were not like this... sometimes enterprise was but for the most part, I could to turn on voyager, generations or DS9 and start watch after months or years with no issues. 

With discovery, I find myself rewatching things if too much time lapses between watching. 

I appreciate the effort and visual effects that make discover different but it would be great for them to bring back the “drama-less” random story line that comes with seasons like voyager. 

A simple, “... we picked up some distortions on the long range scanners, let’s check it out”. Which turns out to be some random new species that requires something that can all be wrapped up by the end of the episode...

Anyone else?"
0,"Maybe for the obi wan series, it cod start with before phantom menace, and show obi wan life and how he met satine and him and quigon and then mid season it shows him at the council getting the assignment to naboo. Then it shows a flashback short of thing and contrasts the first half with his new sad life in tatooine. Idk I think this might be good, but it's just my thoughts."
1,"Like maybe someone who only joined Imperial Starfleet because they were basically forced too (e.g. conscription or peer pressure) but unlike everyone else is really not happy about any of it. But at the same time still has to grit their teeth and bare it so they dont end up in the agony booth every 5 seconds. 

Seems like it'd be an interesting angle to explore the mirror universe with."
0,"I think due to Master and Apprentice and Doku Jedi Lost, he's now one of my favourite characters. Especially when interacting with Qui Gon or Younglings in genrael."
1,I only see warp nacelles.
0,"I was watching episode 318 the Citadel and Obi Wan and Anakin are frozen in carbonite but I thought in Empire Strikes Back, even Vader agreed that no one knew if Han would survive. Am I remembering wrong?"
1,Besides the awful realization at how much time has actually passed between tng and now (yikes) which episode would you like to see revisited in such a way?
1,I just watched Yesterday’s Enterprise probably for the first time since it aired. What a remarkable piece of television that is. But Christopher McDonald in particular put in just a phenomenal acting performance as Castillo. Apparently he auditioned for Riker and came close. It’s interesting to think how the character would have developed as played by McDonald. Maybe a bit more sensitive and less confident. Sort of ironic that he ended up coming on TNG as an alternate first officer from an alternate Enterprise. He certainly made the most of it.
0,"So I've noticed over my time on this subreddit that there are really detailed and unique looking models of clones and stormtroopers that have custom accessories like the ARC trooper Pauldrons or different blasters and Melee weapons, so i was wondering where people were getting said accessories.

1,"All he's ever seen is the 2009 movie.  I'm so thankful he actually seems to like it!  One episode in because I couldn't get past the pilot to watch The Man Trap, but he seems to love it!

I am ecstatic.  He suggested watching Into Darkness, and I stopped him saying that he needs to watch TOS first because of all the little references.

Guys, my middle name is Dax.  I'm crying with joy right now because he LOVES things along the lines of The Boys and Avengers.  I never in a million years thought he'd love Star Trek as much as I do and I'm ecstatic.

Gonna try to watch an episode with him every night before bed.  Wish me luck! :D

PS: He also loves the other thing with Star in its name as well as some anime.  What do you think his favorite episode of TOS will be?  I'm betting on Tribbles."

1,"For me discovery has never been my favorite trek series, but it's been mostly enjoyable, and i've watched every season as it came out.

One thing i've started to notice though, is i really dislike the character of Michael Burnham for some reason. I can't fully put my finger on why, but it's odd as the main character is normally a stand out in any trek series."
0,"Episode 1 feels like a side quest 

Using 1/3 of the prequel's on kid anakin rather than using that time to explore anakin's ascent in the order and descent into the dark side is a huge whiff IMO."
1,"and just when I thought it couldn’t get worse they add an acoustic section in season 3. I’m never going to get to sleep now. 

I’m on my first watch thru and really enjoy it, even though season three was chaotic. I don’t hate the opening it just has no business being that catchy."
0,"It’s fascinated me that they’ve used “our” animals in this film: Goat, rabbit, ferret, horses, lizard, mouse. I might have missed some.

Is it because of a lack of budget for special effects? Or to make it more accessible to kids? Or is there another reason?

Anyone have either a theory or facts to share?"
1,"So, I grew up on TNG/DS9/VOY and I liked ENT, kind-of liked the reboot movies, watched DIS and PIC but this new cartoon, Lower Decks really has me wanting more.

Maybe it’s the Futurama feel of the animation or the environment and sounds of the familiar Star Fleet ship. Maybe it’s seeing iconic and nostalgic Star Trek alien species, both on the ship and on planets. It just all fits together so nicely, continuing on the highly successful TNG timeline. 

I really enjoyed it and am genuinely looking forward to more seasons of Lower Decks, OVER Discovery or Picard."

0,"I like Star Wars Rebels. It was a good time. Not as good as Clone Wars, but it was still pretty good for me. Our heroes were solid and we got to see some pretty cool villains. Thrawn, Maul, Gran Inquisitor, and Darth Vader.

We get to see Vader before ANH. Something many wanted to see for years. And then he just leaves the show after the 2nd season and it literally makes no sense...

Don’t you think Vader would be furiously hunting down our heroes? I mean if you read any outside material of Vader like comics or books, you realize he is a pretty relentless guy, and will stop at nothing until he defeats his enemy. So then why the hell does he just never show up again in any capacity whatsoever after the 2nd season??? Maybe I’m just nitpicking, but seriously it makes no sense to me and I actually found it distracting."

 I'm pretty sure it's not exclusive to star wars either. I was searching for sci Fi electronic bubbling sound which is the best way I can describe it. Similar sounds from 70s 80s sci-fi movies when there's a bunch of computers. I want that sound on a loop!"
1,"So I've been trying to find the font used in titles for DISCO, TOS, TNG, and VOY, but I can't find them anywhere in a way that I can insert them into CSS or onto a doc. Does anyone know where to find them?"
0,"I think it would have been better if Han and Chewbacca had been in the space attack against the Death Star, and had been the ones to destroy it. I feel like it would have made me feel more invested in the battle because at this point in the films I'm far more invested in Han and Chewie than I am in Lando (I mean, I like him but Han and Chewie are far more central characters and had been around longer)

It also would have given the big three their own main role to play. Luke dueling Vader and the Emperor aboard the Death Star, Leia leading the ground assault on Endor to destroy the shield generator, and Han leading the space assault.

I feel like Lucas would have done this but wanted to keep Han and Leia together for the final act. However I feel as though Han and Leia's romance story had already reached a solid resolution at this point anyway and their time on Endor didn't really add much to it. Instead I would put Lando on Endor leading the ground assault with Leia.

I'll conclude by saying it also would have been a fitting call back to Episode IV. Luke destroyed the Death Star and Han played an instrumental role in assisting him. This would have given Han his time to shine by leading the assault and destroying it himself."
1,"So, me and my girlfriend are watching the original series on Netflix, and after moving to the ""second episode"", which is ""The Man Trap"" straight after the pilot we're immediately confused. Should we watch the series in production order instead so that the storyline flows more naturally?"
0,"I always felt like AI is handled kinda weirdly in Star Wars. Just to name a few problems with it: 

Why would you design a droid army as ineffective as the separarist's if there are droids like IG units? Imagine an army with (worse armed) deadly precise assassin droids.

Why would the gonk droid in Jabba's palace feel pain when his feet are burned?

Why would droids have a human like personality at all?

My theory is that there is a relatively simple way to create AI in the Star Wars universe but as a side product it will always have its own will which you have to suppress (maybe the purpose of a motivator?) and require sensory devices. The stupidity of some droids is easily explained by cheap processing units. What are your thoughts on this?"
0,"Hello fellow Star Wars fans.

I haven’t read in a while but recently got back into it. Currently reading Harry Potter but after that and a couple other books I would like to read some Star Wars books. So far the books I’ve read so far are last shot, master and apprentice, resistance reborn, thrawn treason and alliances, Ashoka, lords of the sith, from a certain point of view, dark disciple, rebel files, book of sith, the bounty hunter code, imperial handbook, and a bunch of character encyclopedia, visual guides, and lego Star Wars books. I also have dooku Jedi lost, the eesential guide to warfare and heir to the empire among a couple others, though I haven’t read them yet.

My main question is what book suggestions do you have. A bit of info on my tastes will help so I will provide it here.

I’m fine with both canon and legends, though since I’ve only read one legends book and I forgot what happened in that book I am unfamiliar with legends. I understand that people will likely suggest the thrawn books first, especially  because I have the first book already, but I’m curious on what other legends books are good starting off points.

My favorite time period is the clone wars, although I would like to read old republic material is I find that period interesting whenever I read about it on wookieepedia or hear about it in a YouTube video.

I don’t want to get too involved in a long series, at least not yet. There are many books other than Star Wars books that I want to read and I would like some space for those books between my Star Wars books.

My favorite type of books are action and adventure, although I’m open to trying new types as I haven’t read many other types of books. I’ve heard lost stars is really good and I’m interesting in reading that even though I haven’t read any romance books before.

Although the current high republic books interest me they don’t interest me enough to want to read them at the moment. I would rather save those for later when that time period is a bit more developed. I haven’t really been following high republic news recently and have been out of the loop, so I would like to do a bit of research on my own time before jumping in.

I love anything Jedi/sith related, as I find that incredibly interesting. Same thing goes for clones and the empire.

Lastly I’m also a big sucker for visual guides and encyclopedias and books like that, so if you have any good recommendations I may check them out.

Thanks in advance, both for the suggestions and for reading this long post :)."
0,"So after seeing a meme about how often the Rey vs Kylo duel in TFA is often criticized while the similarly incredible feat of Anakin blowing up the Trade Federation ship in TPM is much less (but not completely) criticized due to the justification of him being the chosen one, it got me thinking about a mentality that I feel a lot of people have ended up believing, intentionally or otherwise: **Anakin being the chosen one does not mean other Force users are weak.** 

Whenever he (or someone related to him by blood like Luke for example) performs some extraordinary feat, the most common justification I see people give is that he and his family are strong in the Force because he was the chosen one. And that is a valid reason that I am not going to argue against. 

But I think people have let this unintentionally make them act as though the Skywalkers are the *only* powerful Force users, which is not the same thing as the *most* powerful Force users. To give a real life example, Muhammad Ali was considered the best professional boxer in the world in his prime, but that didn't mean other pros were bad by any means. 

So to bring it back to what inspired this post, just because someone like Rey isn't a Skywalker by blood (not going to get into the whole ""Rey Skywalker"" debate here, it's an entirely different topic) that doesn't mean that her or any other force user is weak. In fact were are often told that many (including Rey) are actually very strong in the Force. 
Kylo literally says Rey is in TFA. Taking the quote directly from the movie: ""She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows."" Even before the Palpatine stuff in RoS it was established that Rey was in fact strong in the Force. Maybe not as strong as someone like Anakin, but still strong. Just like how someone like Yoda is established to also be very strong, so we naturally don't question much how he can duel 1 on 1 against someone like Dooku in AotC or lift an X-Wing in ESB.

And on a related note, since when did something Force related need any other justification beyond that? It's the fucking Force! It can do all sorts of incredible things! Remember that this is the same thing that allows things like the World Between Worlds and Mortis to exist. So honestly giving a 9 year old the skills to blow up a spaceship or a scavenger the skills to beat a Sith in a duel are far from the most ridiculous things we've seen the Force to be capable of."
1,"Discovery deserves all the Emmy nominations for its special effects, particularly in season 3.

This show outshines other shows like the Mandalorian in terms of special effects but I rarely see any praise for it.

It is especially impressive when you consider that all of the post production for season 3 was completed at home during lockdown.

That is all, I just needed to gush."
1,"Just finished watching Similitude , I must say Star Trek can still surprise you no matter what the series .This is the sort of ethical dilemma that strongly questions ones moral compass ! Something similar to Tuvix (VOY) .Couldn't stomach the scene where Archer actually tells the Trip clone :Sim he will do what it takes to get Trip back! I could see T'Pols eyes ,usually unemotionally clear and sharp, glisten ,and when Sim tell Phlox he was a damn good father I could swear Phloxs deep blue eyes glazed over with emotion too ! Not ashamed to admit I did tear up at that point .Star trek never ceases to amaze!"

It's not what other stars and orbiting planets are called; I guess they would just be called systems. Was this a mistake in Dooku: Jedi Lost?

EDIT: According to [Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_system), solar system is synonymous with star system."

1,"I have been a fan of OG star trek for a minute now, but I am now watching TNG for the first time. I'm currently on the first season and I fucking love it. Sure, a lot of it is silly and weird, and I'm sure the series progresses and gets better as it goes on, but it's all very much enjoyable. Yet, whenever I look up episode reviews on websites like Den of Geek or AV Club or a bunch of other sites they *trash* these episodes. For example, I just watched the episode ""Too Short a Season"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Was it a bit campy? Yes. Was the plot air-tight? No. But it's goddamn enjoyable to watch. It's *fun.* And where else do you even get to watch these crazy sci-fi/fantasy plots play out on TV? 

Alien space juice that will restore your youth but will also, ironically, kill you if you take too much? Melodramatic space-ship captains obsessively seeking to atone for the mistakes of the past? Alien warlords who have paid the price for violently seeking advanced technology, looking to avenge themselves on those who sold it to them? Shit sign my ass up. Yet every single review I find online *hates* this episode. No one else seems to like it but me! I don't get it. Do I have bad taste in TV? Do I just have a high tolerance for camp? Is it just that these episodes are too overshadowed by the greatness to come? 

Even when people recommend the first season they have a list of episodes that you should skip. Well I'm on episode 15 and I don't regret watching a single one...even if they're not all perfect. Why the hate? What am I not seeing?"
0,"This movie contradicts and retcons so many story elements that I wonder how some people at Disney were like “Yeah, this is it guys, we’ve done it, they’re gonna love this?!”...

So let’s see...Palpatine. Yeah, he was killed as part of Darth Vader’s redemption, a heroic act done to save his very own son, sacrificing himself in the process, out of love. Sure, why not bring Palpatine back out of nowhere with a massive fleet of Star Destroyers, each equipped with a mini Death Star, not only making Anakin’s sacrifice look totally worthless, but also making no sense at all, making one question why he hadn’t utilized the Final Order’s deadly fleet much sooner to annihilate the Resistance or at least revealed himself to the First Order instead of playing around with a puppet (a.k.a. Snoke).

Then Rey. In TFA it was hinted that she COULD be related to a powerful, famous Jedi, hence the extremely strong connection to the Force and Anakin/Luke’s lightsaber calling to her and even triggering flashbacks upon physical contact. Then in TLJ we learned that Rey was in fact a “nobody”, the child of some unknown drunken scavengers on Jakku. The message of this was that you can be your own person and succeed without having to be related to a famous Jedi (Skwalker, Kenobi, etc.). THEN, in TROS they throw all that away and reveal that Rey is in fact Palpatine’s granddaughter...But why? It’s a weak explanation as to why she’d been such a Mary Sue all this time and a lackluster attempt at bringing back the already deceased big bad of the saga for a selling point. Anyway, Palps is beaten again in a ridiculously short and boring “fight”, everyone’s happy and there’s peace again in the universe. So when Rey’s asked about her identity she assumes the Skywalker name, emphasizing that blood shouldn’t define who you are and you should be your own person. Familiar, right? Yeah, WE’VE ALREADY HEARD THIS MESSAGE IN TLJ, so TROS spits in its own face by disregarding its own rules set up earlier.

Now Finn. His character arc had always been kind of strange, never seeming to truly find his place or purpose. One thing’s sure: he was always supposed to be the deserted pawn of the bad guys that turns into a hero on the opposition’s side. It was never even remotely hinted at that he could be something more than most others, then suddenly in TROS it is pretty much confirmed that he is Force sensitive. Never to be seen or heard again, though...

Reylo: Even though there had always been some kind of a tension between the two, it was much likely due to how both saw the pull of the other side and their possible future, as well as a possibly ally to turn to their own side in each other. Both of them complementing the other and slowly presenting the looming shadow of their possible fates (Rey on the Dark Side and Kylo giving into the Light within himself) made for a pretty interesting duo but there never was a need for them to fall in love, nor was it ever really hinted at. Yet, they kissed for...you know, reasons. Fan service at its best, I guess.

Force powers: I felt like Rey shooting lightning from her fingertips, a power that we’ve only seen done by some of the most experienced Sith, was utterly stupid and a cheap way of foreshadowing her relation to Palpatine. Also, the addition of the new Force Heal ability, an already established power in the EU was a nice touch, however, they took it too far by one Force user being able to transfer their life essence to someone else and dying in the process.

Kylo’s redemption: Let me make this clear: I loved that scene in the movie and it made me emotional. But, as many of us know it well, it was originally Anakin Skywalker’s ghost who was supposed to appear to Kylo/Ben. It would’ve made much more sense as he’d been obsessed with Anakin’s Sith persona and seeing his grandfather’s true self and hearing him ask him not to make the same mistakes that he once did would’ve made for a much more powerful scene. Instead, Kylo sees the man he himself killed and supposedly always hated, hears him talk about stuff he already knows and suddenly he does a 180 degree turn and runs to Rey’s help. Dunno, doesn’t make much sense."

1,"I'm a big sci fi guy.  I've exhausted pretty much all modern sci fi, and sci fi going back to 2000(and before in some cases).

I hate having to look for new sci fi.  So the idea of having 500+ hours of quality content to watch is appealing.  But, the idea of watching stuff from over 50 years ago seems daunting, considering I've never watched anything made before 1990 probably(i'm 30).

So, while I understand that I'm on a Trek Subreddit, I was wondering if anyone could reccomend a watch list of stuff I should watch, or if I should just commit to watching it all.  Is there significant added value watching the newer stuff, if I watched all the older stuff?

I'm thinking there are 2 options.

1.) Watch it all.

2.) Watch from a certain point onward.  Maybe from the year 1990 onward or something.  Or from a certain series onward.  If anyone has a good starting point to recommend please do."

0,"I love Rogue One but it just occurred to me that taking out Scarif rather than deploying troopers to pick off the remaining rebels makes no sense.

Scarif is clearly used for enormous amounts of data storage such that Krennic had to go there to access the records of every single message Galen Erso had ever sent as well as the fact that the Empire seems to use the Citadel tower to store plans for every major project in the works such as “Starkiller”, “Mark Omega”, “Pax Aurora”, “Black Saber”, etc. This building seems like the equivalent of the Pentagon, the NSA building or CIA HQ. I can’t imagine any country saying “well... some terrorists are occupying the Pentagon’s parking lot... I guess we have to blow up the Pentagon for a show of strength”. Like wut?

The Empire had already demonstrated the Death Star on Jedha and Tarkin would later plan a full demo (which he didn’t use on Scarif) on Alderaan. Do you think maybe it was just Tarkin got ahold of a new toy and liked playing with it without giving much thought to it?

I will say though that when you watch Rogue One and then ANH back to back, the Empire’s urgency and desperation to find the Rebellion seems so much more real and is put into better perspective."

I fucking hope they retcon her death and bring her back because this is such a terrible death. It isn’t even given enough thought aside from one line. It is so god damn stupid. My one question is why. Why did they name drop her? Why not some other person? Literally any other fucking reason?"

0,"After seeing countless ""Rey bad, prequels good"" memes, I was thinking about Rey as a character compared to Luke, Anakin, and other characters. I personally like her as a character and the sequels. This does not mean the movies are without fault (In fact, even though I love the original trilogy I do not think that they are flawless either).

I did a quick search of the subreddit, and there have already been plenty of threads devoted to Rey as a Mary Sue and similar type discussions. While I recognize this topic has already been discussed ad nauseum with people having very polarizing opinions on the subject, I did not participate in those threads so I was hoping to start a friendly dialogue anyway (or at least try) since not all of my points seem to have been made.

I will only discuss TFA Rey at this time since it is the only movie I really considered at any length. Also, I want to focus specifically on Rey without comparing her to Luke or Anakin (To be upfront, I admit that I do think that Rey's power and adeptness with the force is not all that different from Luke or Anakin).

Here are some critical facts:

* Rey is 19 years old at the beginning of TFA
* Rey is abandoned on Jakku when she is 5 years old
* Rey is alone on Jakku for 14 years, and is shown to be adept at fighting with a staff 
   * Assuming Rey starts learning how to fight as late as 10-12, that is 7-9 years of training (This is largely an assumption. Maybe it's talked about in a comic or something. Idk.)
* Kylo defeats Rey on Takodana (he uses the force to make her lose consciousness)
* Kylo recognizes that Rey is very strong in the force, but is just learning her powers (Considering we later find out that her father was Palpatine's clone, it makes sense for her to be very powerful with the force)
* Kylo tells Snoke about Rey's power, and Snoke tells Kylo to bring Rey to him
* Kylo kills Han 
* Chewie shoots Kylo
* Rey tries to shoot Kylo, but Kylo uses the force to paralyze her in place and then force pushes her into a tree knocking her out
* Kylo fights Finn
   * Finn lands a lucky blow on Kylo's arm
* Kylo defeats Finn, and Rey comes to
* Prior to fighting, Kylo tells Rey that she needs a teacher
* Kylo and Rey fight 
   * At first, Kylo is pushing Rey back
   * Rey starts attacking relentlessly (perhaps tapping into her anger and the dark side of the force) and injures Ren
* Snoke orders the First Order to retrieve Kylo, and says that it is time to complete Kylo's training

First, Rey's background is critical to understand why there is nothing unusual about her power. Rey was abandoned and has been alone on an unforgiving planet for 14 years. Her ability to fight and defend herself was crucial to her survival, and even a conservative estimate would give her 7-9 years of combat/fighting experience. This time alone is also critical to her knowledge of flying, ships, etc., but I don't want to focus on that and instead focus on her prowess to be a powerful Jedi.

Rey is clearly proficient with a staff, but you can't assume that she does not know how to fight with anything else. Just because she prefers a staff does not mean she cannot wield a sword. It could be a matter of preference. On top of her practical experience as a fighter, she is also clearly powerful with the force because she is a Palpatine. We have seen that you could be using the force without knowing that you are using the force.

Another critical aspect is that when she fights Kylo in the forest, Kylo is clearly injured and likely fatigued by using the force. He's shot with a bowcaster in the side so he is physically injured and then also likely using the force to keep going. He then expends even more force to paralyze Rey and make her go flying through the air. The physical injuries and fatigue allow Finn to land a blow on Kylo. So now Kylo has two physical injuries on top of fatiguing himself through force use.

It is at this point that he fights Rey. But he isn't fighting to kill Rey, which is hugely important. Kylo could have killed Rey, but he did not want to kill her. He was trying to subdue her so that he could train her, which he expressly tells hers prior to fighting. Then, when they begin to fight, Kylo has the upper hand at first. It is Rey closes her eyes and ""centers"" herself that she starts attacking Kylo relentlessly, and that's when she wounds Kylo. Arguably, she could have been tapping into her anger and the dark side in order to accomplish this feat.

Finally, when Snoke orders Kylo's retrieval, he says that he has to finish Kylo's training. Thus, Kylo is not a finished product either. Kylo, like Rey, has a lot of raw power, but he is far from a finished product.

Also, in a previous encounter when Kylo is not injured, easily defeats Rey.

This pretty definitely shows that Rey is not unusually powerful in the Star Wars universe, and is certainly not a Mary Sue.

Hope we can chat about it without pulling out knives."

1,"I just watched DS9: Rocks and Shoals. Some Starfleet, and some Jem'Hadar (plus a Vorta) are crashed on a planet. The Jem'Hadar are nearly out of Ketracel White. Sisko offered to help them by sedating the Jem'Hadar until help could arrive, but unsurprisingly, the Jem'Hadar refused. This ultimately resulted in a phaser fight, where Starfleet clearly had the upper-hand. All Jem'Hadar were killed in this fight.

Why did they not simply stun the Jem'Hadar? Sisko could then have carried out his offer. Yeah, I know it's not what the Jem'Hadar wanted, but isn't Starfleet supposed to be against killing when an alternative exists?

I'm pretty sure there are other examples in DS9 where phasers seem to be set to kill by default. Am I missing something, or did the writers try to re-define basic use of phasers in order to tell a war story?"

Luke's failure wasnt that he didnt lift a rock x number of times to level up. It was that he didnt have faith in the force. Something Rey clearly has.

1,"We are bound by are varying degrees of love towards various Treks, but if there's one thing we can all agree on, it is that Trek encompasses a moral lesson of helping others

If you go to most Star Trek Wikipedia pages connected with today's announcements, you will see them void for the most part. These additions range from the date for Lower Decks and Picard, casting, plot details etc...

As someone who had been watching these announcements trickle in, I began adding these snippets of news right? It's such a fulfilling thing, to feel like you are contributing in some small part to people's understanding of information, and in the pursuit of truth. But with the event being live, sources are hard to come by initially

Wikipedia requires sources, otherwise you could put literally anything on there without consequence, but with this being a live event, it meant websites would not report on these things until minutes or hours later. Which is why it is so important to get the info on there first, and then add a source when they become available

This next part requires context: Wikipedia has two modes, a visual editor, and a code-based editor. One of these is obviously vastly easier than the other, and as someone with difficulty typing things like that from physical disability, I simply cannot dedicate the time and pain required to learn the second of those methods. Wikipedia requires the text-based editor for tables, and other more complicated tasks, which obviously takes a good amount of time from a person like me to get right. So boom, Star Trek's table of series is updated, with the new dates. The source link is broken, but you hope that a better person comes along and lends a hand

Nope

I get a barrage of notifications, like machine gun fire, of one obsessive editor by the name of Alex, just wiping them all out. One of which was even done mere seconds later, insinuating that this guy was constantly refreshing, watching the stream also, and waiting for my contributions, just to remove them, out of some sick joy I suppose? Yes, many lacked a source, and the ones that did weren't formatted greatly, but to think Trek was something preaching companionship, and all fellow ""fans"" can do is kick dirt in your face. 

I use this analogy, imagine you are trying to redecorate, and you paint a room too bright of a colour. And you look at it and go ""Oh no, that colour isn't too right, how about we demolish the house now?""

Also context: This user demands evidence of said announcements, which are easy to come by, considering ""insert title of show"" into google and boom, source. So it required a whole lot more effort to undo what I had contributed, rather than to try and straighten out a few errors

So currently, Star Trek Wikipedia across the board does not acknowledge the events of today at all. Lower Decks is still ""TBD 2021"", Picard is ""TBD"", and pigs can fly.

Some of you might remember a somewhat similar situation with Memory Alpha, where a cast member, who was non-binary, was denied the right to simply have gender neutral pronouns on her page, and it was only after backlash that these things changed

Do not go onto Wikipedia and edit in spite of this unbecoming member, unless you are legitimately a skilled contributor who would be willing to help out on various pages, to everyone else, just take away the lesson that it is a whole lot easier to help someone out than to spite them."

Now the thing is that this relationship always felt slightly creepy to me. It has a very similar problem to Twilight, where Edward looks 17 but is actually 100, so if you made him look his age then he'd look like a very old man making out with a 16 year old.

I believe I can get this on netflix.  I think it was an episode on star trek the next generation.  I'm sure this was one of the stories in the series.  Unless I am remembering wrong and it didn't view it.

They encounter aliens on a ship that don't know how to repair anything, because they relied on the computers on the ship.  They basically didn't bother learning and therefore they lost most of what they learned.  Apparently from being on board for generations they basically forgot how to operate and repair things.  They regressed basically in what they knew.

I need to know the specific series and the episode.  Does anyone know this?  Does anyone know the specific season and episode?  That would help a lot.

Again, I believe it was star trek the next generation.  There also might have been another plotline going on and it may not have been the primarily focus of the episode.  However I clearly remember it being part of the episode.  I think this series sometimes incorporated lesser plots or related plotlines into the main plot.  However they could have made this the main storyline since it seemed interested.  As in how did they lose what they learned.  Why did they become lazy in regard to learning.  Why did they just rely on the ship computer system.  There could have been other issues and history they could have incorporated, but they instead relegated this as a small scene within the main story of this episode.  I guess it was used to provide some sort of comic relief or something."

Blame it all on my roots  
 Red Guitar with Black Boots  
 And ruined your Jedi Affairs  
 The last one to know  
 The last one to show  
 Yet I blasted a hole  
  In qui gon’s chest laying over there  
 

And I saw the surprise  
 And the fear in your eyes  
 When Qui Gon’s Life Force faded away  
 And I dueled you  
 Said, my legs may be through  
 But you'll never hear me complain  
 

‘Cause all my parts were in low places  
 When my legs went  
 my torso chased it  
 I’ll get Obi one day  
 Then I’ll be OK  
   
I'm not big on the Jedi Races   
 Think I'll slip on down to garbage places   
 have some mechanical legs now that replaced it 

Well, I guess I was wrong  
 I just don't belong  
 But then, I've been there before  
 Everything's all right  
 I'll just ask Obi Wan for a fight   
 Maybe I'll duel him at the door  
 

Hey, I didn't mean  
 To cause a big scene  
 Just give me an a duel with obi wan and then  
 Well, I'll be as high  
 As that Senate   
 That you're livin' in

 ‘Cause all my parts were in low places  
 When my legs went  
 my torso chased it  
 I’ll get Obi one day  
 Then I’ll be OK  
 

I'm not big on the Jedi Races   
 Think I'll slip on down to garbage places   
 have some mechanical legs now that replaced it

1,"TL;DR - Should i watch the original series and why.

I can't seem to bring myself to watch the original series. Trying once and only getting a few episodes in, the spark just isn't there for me. Having then given up and gone back to rewatching voyager or DS9. In my mind TOS carries alot of weight, as it's the start of the whole universe and a franchise which i adore.. but I don't love it, and i feel like i should. 

My earliest memories of Star Trek are from TNG and Voyager as these are the 2 series I watched first a long long time ago.

I'm looking for inspiration to watch TOS. I've religiously watched almost everything else, (Enterprise, Next Gen, DS9, Voyager, Picard, Discovery) and most of the films too. 

Please can you share your experience of TOS? is it worth watching, or am i being dramatic?"

He’s just a guy that happened to be a good fighter, and a good brother, causing him to be brainwashed and enslaved by ventress and talzin, then he just wants to be a brother to maul, getting sucked into his crusade and eventually killed by Sidious. He was definitely a monster, but it really wasn’t his fault. Whereas ventress is just a sadistic, selfish harpy and the attempt at giving her a sympathetic backstory has just never had any effect on me"

1,"My own personal theory for Star Trek, is theatCyrano Jones was actually a member of Section 31.

It works so well for me because I always love the cliche of the fool actually being the master.

Either Cyrano Jones is an alcoholic, bumbling surveyor and trinket peddler, who happened to save a planet through sheer unmitigated incompetence.

Or he is a calculating individual who uses this cover to travel freely in one of the most contested zones between the Federation and Empire. Who used his extensive knowledge and spy network to prevent the sabotage of Sherman's planet."
1,"I'm a Star Trek fan, but not a big enough fan apparently to understand what happened when Sisko got ""called"" by the beings in the wormhole. Why don't they want him dead? Why do they care? If they leave beyond time, why was it even necessary for Sisko to explain to them what is going to happen to Bajor if the Dominion wins? Shouldn't they already know/understand that? Why do the beings say they need to ""punish"" Sisko for wanting to... do what exactly, interfere in his own life? Try and save Bajor and/or the alpha quadrant? What is it that Sisko's doing that bothers them and why would they want to punish him for it? Finally, what does it mean that Sisko ""will find no rest"" on Bajor? I'm guessing it's something to be revealed in a later episode, but it's still a bit confusing."
1,"If I understand rank correctly, O'Brien, as a non-commissioned officer is outranked by every commissioned officer. That means that even an ensign technically outranks O'Brien, right?

On DS9, he is the chief of station operations, and when he's on the Defiant, he is often seeing work equivalent to a chief engineer. In DS9, we do see a lot of other non-commissioned officers, so I think it's reasonable to assume that O'Brien outranks many of maybe all of them. But what if a commissioned officer wants to join his team? Is O'Brien still in charge, or is he instantly outranked?

I realize any sensible officer would do what O'Brien says since he's the guy with the most experience, but technically, O'Brien would be giving suggestions, not orders, right?"
0,"Having Luke be the Jedi who shows up at the end of S2 of Mando was a bad choice and just doesn't add any value to the show. There isn't anywhere to go with that story and it feels like they just did another ""hallway scene"" to make up for the people who hated Luke in TLJ."
0,"For some context, I've never touched a single piece of Star Wars cinematics. I'm not interested in the TV shows and shorts, only the movies, and I would like to watch them in chronological order.

If anyone could provide me a good list, I would be very thankful. Thanks in advance! :)"

1," 

Scotty gave the past aluminum glass. (1) Though we have made it today, so umm a 15 or so advance on tech ant that bad. But Voyager saw the computer boom of the 60s onward explode in a way that we have not seen up till janway blew the source of that advancement sky high.

Then we got Enterprise, I forget the guy's name, think he was the science officer? Seems like he had a thing for stealing future tech from that one guy. (2) T.O.S Flew into the unwon with outdated tech and ship to the one we see in discovery.  
The tech you see in both discovery and in Enterprise is tech that should not have existed in their timeline. Fro kirk the transporter was new, yet for Archer, it was also new. Shields were not an advent of Archer's time, yet his ship was shield near the end.

One of the few joys I get from the whore that is std. It's cheap and all it wants to do is fulfill our base instinct as apes, with action and violence. Yet I do like watching how the tech advanced from such abuses of the time.  
I also kind of like how they never bother to tell you this fact. Alternative timelines can be fun.

I don't know, it makes star trek feel dirtier like it was used in some fowl way.

1,"I was watching the often reviled TOS episode ""The Alternative Factor"" the other day and I realized something very strange. The plot, and stylistically, for some reason, matches up with elements of Twin Peaks: The Return. To a degree that I think a case can be made that David Lynch may have drawn some inspiration from it.

 The first thing I noticed was when Spock is explaining the magnetic wink event to Kirk the exchange ends with Kirk saying, ""That means your saying..."", to which Spock replies, ""is **nonexistence**"". When Good Cooper is escaping from the red room, he is dropped into the mauve zone by the evolution of the arm's doppelgänger, who cries, ""**Nonexistent**"" right before it happens. The arm is also called the man from another place in original run, and initially the script alluded that they were aliens, though that was input by Mark Frost. That's weird but alright not much there. Then the plot develops centering around Lazarus and his anti-matter Doppelganger traveling through time and fighting between worlds. Very strong similarities there to Twin Peaks between Good Cooper and Mister C. 

 Also there are a number of stylistic comparisons, one in particular is very strong, when cooper is dropped into the mauve zone he falls through space blurring and shaking. In the star trek episode there are very similar frames when Lazarus-A and B are fighting, albeit with a blue tint, one in particular is almost identical with stars superimposed in a double exposure over Lazarus.

 Finally and honestly what convinced me was the ending. Anti-matter Lazarus traps doppelgänger Lazarus in the tunnel between their worlds, a sort of pocket universe. I've attached a link to an album with screencaps from both at the bottom.

 The ending of The Return is up for debate, but a very popular interpretation is this(major spoilers): 

&gt;!After Cooper travels back to 1989 to stop Laura's death, he returns to the present and travels with Diane to a pocket universe, they arrive in what seems like the past to perform a sex magic ritual and lure Judy into it, he wakes up and the Motel they stayed at now looks much newer and it seems he's traveled back in the present.  He then brings Laura/Carrie to her home in Twin Peaks, Washington after finding her in Twin Peaks, Texas(a real place). They drive in a single night all the way there and arrive ostensibly the same night, though it's not made clear it doesn't imply they ever stop. In reality to get from Twin Peaks, Texas to North Run, Washington where Twin Peaks was partly filmed is about 28 hours by car non stop. This has been interpreted to mean the geography of this reality is much contracted, tentatively supporting the pocket universe hypothesis. When they arrive at the house they speak with the owner, walk back into the street, seem confused, and Cooper asks, ""what year is it?"" before Laura looks back at the house, screams, and all the light go out in the house before the frame cuts to black. Some interpret this as the pocket universe collapsing through forcing Judy to come into contact with Laura. So he's traveling through time with the aid of the White Lodge and the giant/fireman, trying to trap her in a pocket universe. Though it's not at all cut and dry, and whether or not he succeeded if it was his attempt is also impossible to say.!&lt;

Bonus points, the next episode of Star Trek is The City at the Edge of Forever, where they are travel back to the 1930's and meet Edith Keeler, who gives a speech in the mission where she starts talking about man harnessing the atom for the sake of good. That's a major plot point of Twin Peaks where it is implied that the atom bomb released Bob and crew into our universe creating the evil Cooper has to battle.

This is all tenuous at best and David Lynch's work is dense and his inspirations are often difficult to discern, and to my knowledge he's never talked about this and I doubt he would, but I think it's neat to think he might have taken some inspiration from the style and story of this episode, and he was in college at the time the episode came out and very well may have seen it at an important stage in his creative development. It might be a long shot but there are a number of similarities. What do y'all think?

After being so disappointed with Discovery and Picard, I'm watching it again and I'm loving it even more. Half way through season 1 and the writing, storylines, characters and arcs are so well written, acted and the characters casted. Even through I remember most of the episodes and especially how the series ends, I'm still intrigued as to how the characters grow in the series.

Star Trek to me was always an escapism where we could believe that humans together could put aside our differences and become almost a compassionate beacon amongst the universe.

Tbh I just really wish they made a good Trek video game because theres a such a large sandbox there to play in and make something awesome."
1," Imagine  a setting with transporter technology, similar to Star Trek's, but even  more advanced and affordable for everyone. They also would have  developed a way to transport over long distances and any transport could  be ""site to site"" without issue...

This  kind of breaks everything... No more need for ships. Everyone would  just teleport everywhere... No ships therefore no space battles... Need  to attack a rival faction? Just ""transport"" the weapons on site... Just  enter the desired target's coordinates. Phasers and torpedoes would just  spontaneously materialize in orbit over planets/moons/space stations...

All resources would also be gathered and delivered by teleportation.

Just a curious ""thought exercise"" I had today and felt like sharing..."

1,"&gt;*Two months ago a Federation  starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.  We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety  precautions. The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their  ozone.  They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately fifty  Earth years. Due to their enormous military budget, the  Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this  catastrophe.  Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador I opened a dialogue  with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He proposes to  commence negotiations at once.* \- Spock (Undiscovered Country

From the looks of things, Qo'noS was in trouble, 50 years of oxygen left, the Klingon race and culture was on the verge of annihilation. So why was Chang and the rest of his Klingons cohorts against making peace treaty with the Federation?

Also, one of Chang's men says:

&gt;*In any case, we know where this is leading. The annihilation of our culture.*

The Klingon race and culture were on the verge of annihilation already. In 50 years, the Klingons would die off anyway. I know Klingons have this philosophy of ""dying on my feet than living on my knees,"" but I don't think there's any honor in sabotaging your own race just because you want to continue hostilities with the Federation, in fact, it's dishonorable."

1,"Couldn't they just turn on the Impulse engines, accelerate to 99.99+% the speed of light, and get back to Earth in what would only be a few weeks or months for them? Furthermore, the warp engines just bend spacetime around the ship, not actually accelerate it, so they could just accelerate to near-light speeds, dilate time, turn on the warp engines to get to their destination faster (from an external observer's point of view), and wouldn't even need to arrive tens of thousands of years in the future (although I don't see why they wouldn't take advantage of that in any case). 

Additionally, I don't see why that kind of thing wouldn't be a common practice in the Star Trek universe to begin with. Want to access future technology early? Just accelerate to near-light speeds using impulse engines, go to some star system a few hundred/thousand light years away, and come back. You'll be centuries or millennia in the future, while only a relatively short period of time would have passed for you."

0,"*Please don’t downvote an opinion. Disagree in the comments but only downvote if I am being an asshole.*

I will never understand the hate TLJ gets. I think it’s the best of the new trilogy. Outside of the weird casino sequence with Finn and Rose, Snoke’s anticlimactic death, and Leia’s space floating (I laugh out loud every time) I thought it was great. 

Don’t see why nobody believes Luke Skywalker is incapable of temporarily betraying his teenage idealistic morals. He explains it’s due to his hubris as “a legend” that made him fail Ben and reject the force. I don’t see why fans see it as betraying his character. Would it honestly be better if Luke never strayed from the happy-go-lucky “come on gang let’s band together and fight via the power of friendship”? A character losing him/herself and regaining their path IS character development. I’d be much more bored if we found out Luke was the same person he was decades ago. 

Further TLJ has some awesome canonical story telling. The sequence where Luke/Rey describes the force and how it is everything around them is the amazing to me. The force is an abstract concept and that scene is the best job the whole series has ever done in helping the viewer visualize it. 

I also love the final bit where Luke was omnisciently creating a “ghost” of himself. Tbh before then I feel like we the viewer never got to see Luke as the great Jedi/force master he is supposed to be. This scene is the one time where we can see Luke is truly a special force-wielder. 

All in all I think it’s at worst an average SW films. I like it much more than Episodes 1-3. The entire plot of 7-9 is messy but it’s still good. It’s hard for us to escape from our first love (OT) as many of us were fans of the series long before the Disney era came out."

I’m sure there’s other stuff he does that makes him worse, but just the way he treats the troops is enough to make me dislike him. The writers definitely did a good job writing a character to hate."

1,"Who thought THAT was a good idea?

What a sendoff.  Wow.  That was probably the weakest episode in ALL of Star Trek.

Frakes and Sirtis are clearly much older, and both put on weight.  You couldn't shoehorn those scenes into the TNG episode Pegasus, no matter how hard you try.  The CGI Enterprise D, what was that?!?  It looked terrible!!!  

And in Pegasus, Riker is deeply troubled the moment he sees Pressman on the transporter pad right up until Picard lets him out of the brig.  Riker's mood in Voyages is nothing CLOSE to that, and the whole part of Deanna counselling him through making a decision to violate orders, what was that?  Why was the last Enterprise episode about Riker's little moral issue 200 years later?!?

And on Enterprise side of things, the whole story with Shran having his daughter kidnapped, and them catching up to the enterprise and Trip taking them out; that was so forced.  Trip should have died in Terra Prime.  There is no tension in the entire episode.  We know how it's gonna end.

I'm sure this has been all said before, but I need to say it."

You see all tho Han Solo is from Star Wars he still is just human and the only weapon he has is his DL-44 blaster pistol. He also isn't wearing any armor and the ""Laser"" doesn't make his weapon superior if it's slower than a bullet and has only heat damage. On the other hand John Marston is a trained Rancher Outlaw who has Cattleman Revolver that  shoots six bullets until need of reloading, plus the bullet is faster. Long story short I think John Marston will win but it could be a draw (no pun intended) also I prefer John than Han."
0,"Let me start off by saying, I HATE episode 8 and episode 9. I think episode 8 is a movie with absolutely no plot besides “we’re getting chased through light speed”. I could understand if there was more training scenes with Rey, you know, to actually justify her skillful ness in the force.. it just sucked. Episode 9, well, that goes without saying. But episode 7 is great. The opening sequence with Rey searching the fallen Star Destroyer, the bonds between the characters, the tasteful way they brought back the original characters and blended them in with the new. There’s a lot I can say about this movie. I really think it’s one of the best Star Wars movies period. I really wish episode 8 and 9 lived up to 7. I was looking forward to so much more, like an actual consistent character arc and a consistent plot, but no. Does anyone else really love 7 but hate 8 and 9?"

It used to be one of my favorite games on the N64, and after a few minutes, I could see why. I honestly felt like I was instantly back in 2nd Grade again, feeling like a kid and having a blast zipping around the tracks with Anakin (yes, I know he's not the best racer, but that's who I always used as a kid). Sadly, 24 hours later, I had finished all the tracks and unlocked all of the racers. It's still fun to play, don't get me wrong, but I still wish there was more. 

I know it would likely never happen, but I would love for them to make a new version of the game. I feel like there's a decent sized demand for it with just the Star Wars name plus Nostalgia alone, plus they could add features like online racing and customizable pods and racers. Again, I'm just one person, but Is it foolish to think that may be possible, especially considering EA is losing exclusive rights?"

Like i enjoy rebels quite a bit but some episodes are not so gd and then others are really damn amazing and because its a series and it progresses like that and has time for many gd moments it gives an overall gd story and i kinda just forgot the boring bits i didn’t like. As well as that u have way more time to expand and add to this massive universe that immerses u a lot better with a tv series like clone wars and mandolorian for example. Like the clone wars taught me a lot more lore than the films ( and no im not shitting on the prequels i love two of them) . Anyway yh thats just my opinion on it i feel like there is less of a divide when it comes to tv shows compared to the films and i think moving forward they should avoid films now.

0,"Title is mostly to catch attention. This is really just an idea of an expanded SW universe idea I’ve had, it’s not written all that well.. there’s probably a decent chunk of typos, but if you can read and try to follow the story and lmk what you think that’d be great.. I’m expecting some, if not a lot, of hate so if y’all could just try to be not overly harsh that’d be cool.. it’s just a fans idea

I’ve been thinking about ways to expand the SW universe into new canon and a new Saga - throwing out random ideas of how to bring the SW ‘force-users’ to Earth.

So as we know SW takes place a “long time ago, in a galaxy far far away” so the new Saga/era would be present or at the very least somewhat modern dated..

We also know that humans exist in the SW universe, but we don’t know the origin or that species necessarily in terms of their home planet, how they got there, etc.... this part leaves room for creativity 

Anyways, at an attempt to achieve something similar to Marvels MCU in terms of the interlocking storylines and such... An idea I’ve had is something along the lines of a force-user escaping a dark-side controlled SW galaxy and landing on Earth. 

The Dark side would have created a new cutting-edge tech that can now jump outside of their own SW galaxy (for the matter of simplicity it would be the closest neighboring galaxy - which happens to have Earth) to expand their power and control. They’ve already got complete control (like they have in the previous films) but this time, because of this new tech, they are dominating new unchartered worlds outside of their galaxy and expanding their army.

Think of side stories similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/lc81bb/okaythis_is_badass/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

The Jedi that have managed to survive, w/ the exception of less than a few (if any.. obv minor details like this are flexible), have decided they need to either escape simply to survive, to keep the Jedi code alive, or to grow an army to outside of their universe also to prevent the inevitable force of the Dark Side over all life.

So now we’re at Indiana Jones... I haven’t thought this thorough so bare me with me - this is mostly to feel out the general ideas. The image I just keep coming back to is Indiana Jones uncovering a lightsaber from somewhere remote that dates back to the dinosaur days.

Jumping back to the Jedi, all we know is that one of the human Jedi escaped (a storyline that would’ve been covered in a previous film at this point)... so the lightsaber discovery would be the first indication to the fanbase that the human Jedi landed on Earth.

This could open the door to a lot of things that I’d love  to hear peoples opinions on:

• so a force using human-Jedi landed on Earth during Dinosaur days

—&amp;gt; which could playoff the idea that a human Jedi mated (either with a fellow human-Jedi, or just human from the SW universe (possibly a lover) that escaped with he/she) and *now* a super super tiny fraction of the current human species  is prone to having force abilities. 

• Indiana starts uncovering other artifacts within the lightsaber and realizes the Kyber crystal isn’t from this planet and holds all sorts of untapped energy that could be scientifically beneficial (which could lead to other villain stories)

• This leaves room for what I think could be my favorite part.. Only two current humans, one good - one bad, are force sensitive. Both get their own character development and so on eventually fighting with the light side winning (possibly even converting the other force sensitive) - they could be reached out to thru the force by the first Jedi that landed on Earth to guide their teachings... only because eventually...

• that army the dark side had been gathering for years and terraforming other worlds (which all of this has the potential to have their own movies on, possibly not hinting they’re related, idk) finally reached Earth. Where first they send the Aliens and Predator like creatures to do their killing for them only to be defeated or been resisted by a then Avengers like unit of new SW Saga characters - which I haven’t broadened the scope of in this post, but you can get creative.. new heroes who may possibly have a heightened midichlorian count related to the average human, but still not enough to use the force.. which could heighten IQ, fighting abilities, perhaps gene mutations when exposed to something, idk you get the idea.

• the Thanos moment would be when a dark side user from the SW universe enters the big screen after several movies in. It would be the first time a lightsaber fight will have taken place again between two force users. This Earth born Jedi would become no match. Is suggested to become this Siths new apprentice to rule all of Earth... how it goes from here, I’m not sure but that’s basically the simple storyline



If you’ve stuck around this long, ty

I’ve had this idea for a little while, still haven’t been able to articulate it all that well but I got tired of waiting and wanted to share it.. if there’s a couple people that take it well, I’ll consider thinking it out a little better and shaping it up in an easier to read way

E: Oh, and Indiana Jones would be played by Robert Downey, who would found some new overseeing branch or team, essentially being the founder of the SW avenger like team - you can’t tell me he wouldn’t make a great Indy either

E2: the lightsaber discovery could be at one of the Great pyramids or Mayan temples, which in future movies is revealed to be a Jedi Temple"

Have you ever watched A New Hope and see Luke's hair go all over the place in color? Sometimes it'll look somewhat blond, then it'll go completely brown in other shots. Empire pretty much did away with Luke's blond hair, but I know originally Luke did have somewhat yellow-ish hair -- not overly, but still there to say it. 

Why didn't in behind the scenes, the team didn't just dye Hamill's hair so it didn't keep changing color all the time? I'm pretty sure I read that they just sprayed some lighter colors on it -- which isn't permanent and will look different in shots that are probably days apart. 

Is there something I'm missing? Wouldn't it have been less inconsistent if the team just dyed it the color they wanted -- or does blond hair go all over the place like in the movie? I know blond can fade with different seasons, but not for THIS movie set a day. Just bugged me."

It would be similar to the new ‘Tales Of The Walking Dead’ so that’s coming out except it’s based on the Star Wars Universe.

It would be live-action and there be 6-8 episodes per season. Each episode would focus on a different story or character in the Star Wars Universe. Like an episode based around Darth Vader hunting down a Jedi so we get some post ROTS Vader, an episode about Palpatine’s early days and how he was trained under Plagueis, one about the High Republic, one about Luke’s adventures after ROTJ like that one Battlefront 2 mission, one about Snoke’s origins etc.

The show would show us several different eras of Star Wars and would cover stories that may not have a chance to have their own show or movie.

PICARD: Yes, Data. What is it? 
DATA: What is death? 
PICARD: Oh, is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the most difficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into an indestructible form, forever unchanging. They believe that the purpose of the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-like garden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity. On the other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinking into nothingness, with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely a delusion. 
DATA: Which do you believe, sir? 
PICARD: Considering the marvellous complexity of our universe, its clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter, energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence must be more than either of these philosophies.

1,"Man I loved this episode. It was such a product of its time.

First off they kept using the word 'gender' as a synonymn for 'sex'. Because, you know, 99% of the time, up until very recently, gender was a synonymn for sex.

They kept mis-sexing the cogenitor. The aliens kept calling it an it, and I believe tpol corrected tucker and told him that it wasn't a 'she'. Archer did the same thing and kept calling it a she. Which, for me, I can totally relate with.  I really don't care about gender, I think it's super unimportant and outside of transgenders/sexuals, I don't think there should be nearly as many people obsessed with gender.

Third, we get a really good example of the prime directive in action. A solid explanation here. While our society would see the way these aliens are treated this cogenitor sex as cruel it's not our place to change it. When you see a fence in the middle of nowhere your first instinct should be to find out why it's there. Not to tear it down. Maybe Trip is right, maybe he's wrong, we really don't know and that's the point. We really don't know what's right or wrong unless we've walked a mile in someone else's shoes.

Lastly, my wife walked in the room when Bakula was going to chew out Trip. I stopped it and told her to check this shit out. This is the most angry Bakula will ever get. And he just falls -so flat.- Jesus. He's so bad. He's supposed to be super pissed, but it just comes off like he's a dissapointed dad having a heart to heart."
0,"Think about it. A lawless, violent, desert planet has so much potential for an open world sandbox game. You could do bounty hunting sidequests, you could do Podracing, you could fight Tusken Raiders, you could fight other bounty hunters, you could fight stormtroopers (given that the game is set during a period in which the Empire had power), etc etc. It'd make a great action role playing game or something like that."
0,"I saw this at several stores before Christmas, and didn't get it. Then after the holidays it was gone, and I hadn't seen it since. I figured that it was going to be retired and I had lost my chance.

Then this weekend, my sons and I were at Barnes &amp; Noble looking at the Lego sets. My 13-year-old son spotted it behind another large Star Wars Lego set. Even though I had wanted it before, I debated about getting it: at $60, it's a bit pricey for a Lego set and something Star Wars-related. But he talked me into it, and I'm glad he did! He helped me put it together, and it is very cool. The range finder flips down, which is pretty cool too. And behind it in the pics is the Lego ISS, which was a birthday gift to him and he put together (without my help); another neat Lego set."
0,"Maybe it’s just how they choose to use her character, but I’m mid rewatch now in advance of Bad Batch and so far we have:

1) Arrogance about confronting Ventress despite being warned otherwise (which almost kills her)

2) Giving up on her own Padawan for all intent purpose when she’s trapped in the tank with Ahsoka on Geonosis

3) (not there yet) But doesn’t see rising darkness in Bariss that leads up to the end of the series 

My previous viewings always left me with the impression that she represents the worst of the Jedi way. Like the contemporary Jedi, she’s too detached from emotion, seemingly believes she’s beyond reproach, and blind to the rising darkness in the galaxy.

Perhaps that’s why it’s *her* apprentice that rejects the Jedi so violently. Bariss sees so closely at first hand the Jedi’s failings (assuming Luminara is indeed a strawman for them)"
1,"I’m a life long Star Trek fan. Grew up on TNG. Love all of ds9, voyager and I’m enjoying the newer discovery and Picard, but never watched TOS. Due to all the references etc in all the other series I decided to go all in and watch it. 

I finished s1e5: The Enemy Within last night. I am totally put off by it and annoyed and legit female angry if you will. 

So-some part of Kirk just assaults Yeoman. Yeoman just can do nothing as he’s the captain (eye roll). Then, at the end Spock eludes that she liked it? What?? WHAT? And this is some essential side of him that must be a part of him? Like hey-were it not for their intellect man just assaults women? What?

The animated series insists on breaking the canon of the films via making the clones as white as possible and it irritates me to no end so I edited Echo to look at all like Jango Fett. I de-aged him while I was at it because if the clones age double time, they're only 26 by the end of the war?

0,"So Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, randomly selected 12 individuals sometime immediately at the end of the Clone Wars to appoint as Grand Admirals in which doing so allowed him to have more direct control over the Empire's military. 

Smart. However in ANH it's been stated that Palpatine dissolved the senate which gave him control over the regional bureaucracies in favor of ""fear of the battle station"". 

His decision to dissipate the senate completely contradicts his logic in appointing the Grand Admirals, right?"

1,"Trek has some odd pieces of lore, but it occurred to me the other day that writers of modern Trek have latched onto those pieces in weird ways, some are explained ok and are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, others are more major.  For me, some of the writing weirdness is why modern Trek has been harder to like than 60’s, 80’s, and 90’s Trek.  There are three examples of what I interpret as “weird assumptions” that came to mind: Twin androids, Klingon Organ Redundancy, and the cause of the Burn

Picard featured a colony of soong type androids.  This is actually the best explained of the three since there was an actual technobabble explanation of “Fractal Neuronic Cloning.”  Still, the entire run of Picard’s first season, I thought it was odd that all the Androids were twinned, but then it occurred to me that Data was a twinned android too, with Lore.  It made me wonder if the writers assumed that since Data had a twin, then did all androids have to have a twin?  Of course Data wasn’t created as a twin, nor was Lore, nor was B4, but I have to wonder.  Now, all things considered, since they actually gave an explanation, I can let this one slide despite the fact I think it’s a strange quirk.

The next one is visually annoying until it comes to one single scene in the season 1 finale of Discovery and that scene really annoys me.  In TNG, it’s established that Klingons have double redundant organs to compensate for the injuries common in Klingon life.  But, from 1979 until 2012 (Star Trek Into Darkness), the outward appearance of Klingons was relatively consistent.  Especially concerning their external biology, they are mostly the same as humans.  Look at all Klingons in TNG, DS9, Voyager, and several movies, specifically look at their nostrils: they have two.  When Discovery came along, now they have four nostrils.  It’s almost as if the writers saw that Klingons have double redundant organs and they assumed that logically they should double something that is visual in order to reinforce this piece of lore.  And then there was the one Klingon who was taking a piss on Qo’nos and has two streams, implying that male Klingons have two penises…  There are several instances of Klingon/human relationships, how does that work? Regardless, the two dong Klingon irks the hell out of me, but so does the massive change in Klingon appearance.

This last one is one that has actual consequences, galactic consequences: the cause of the Burn.  The Burn was caused by a symbiotic relationship between a Kelpien and a Dilithium planet and a trauma to this Kelpien caused a wave to go out through subspace that momentarily rendered all Dilithium inert and therefore any ship with an active warp core suddenly had an unmoderated Matter/Anti-matter reaction destroying all of those ships.  The thing is, this makes the assumption that the only thing powering warp drive is M/AM throughout the entire Galaxy, when in TNG, DS9, and Voyager, there are multiple examples of ships being powered by things other than M/AM.   90s Trek took an IDIC approach to technology: given millions of civilizations all having different resources, there are bound to be many who figure out a completely different method of powering an engine that warps space allowing for FTL simply because they don’t have the same material resources as other races.  And when it gets down to details, we rarely see the Warp engine of most races and the only races that we know with absolute certainty use Dilithium in a M/AM reactor is the Federation and the Klingons.  On the other hand, we know that the Romulans use Artificial Quantum Singularities in their largest ships and MIGHT use M/AM in smaller vessels.  Add to that, since the Romulans had joined the Federation at the time of the Burn, why wasn’t the AQS used as an emergency replacement at the very least?  It wouldn’t require the use of a material that mysteriously stopped working and caused countless deaths, after all.  But no, the AQS isn’t even mentioned.  I can only assume that this is another example of the writers latching onto the fact that the Federation uses M/AM, therefore EVERYONE uses it."

1,"It's common to complain about holodeck episodes, especially the fact that the safety protocols seem to always fail. And there are some poor uses of the holodeck. But I actually think it was a clever storytelling device, especially for the 90s shows that were expected to crank out over twenty episodes each season. 

The holodeck allowed the writers to transport the characters to different times and places with an in universe explanation. It made a lot more sense than having the characters visit gangster or fascist planets like in the original series. Besides there are some great episodes centered on the holodeck, ""Elementary, Dear Data"" and its follow up ""Ship in a Bottle,"" ""Heroes and Demons,"" and ""Bride of Chaotica!"", for instance."

I heard a rumor or idea at some point about the park being split into Sequel and The Mandalorian timelines.

Remembering this now, I’m thinking, what if they brought the Starspeeder 3000 to the Mando half, seeming as it takes place only a few years after RotJ.

Not even as a ride, maybe just on a landing pad, or as a ‘wreckage’ turned into part of a shop for Starspeeder merchandise.

Yet when the mind-melded ‘backup’ of Spock that lives within McCoy is re-fused with Spock’s regenerated body, he remembers saying that line and says it again. If that memory happened after McCoy, how is it possible for him to recall it? McCoy’s mind has no way of storing a thought it’s never seen, I would think...

1,"Riker was Captain Material after his first year on the Enterprise D. In Season 2 he was preparing to command his own ship before he eventually backed off.

Through the years he was offered command multiple times and yet he preferred to stay as the first officer of the Flagship. As Picard noted, there's a certain prestige that comes with being a part of the Enterprise, but nothing compares to commanding your own ship.

If I recall, the last ship he was offered before finally taking command of the USS Titan, was the USS Melbourne. If he decided to take that command, he would be dead, because the Melbourne was destroyed at Wolf 359.

As great as Riker was at being Commander and a Captain, I highly doubt the USS Melbourne would have stood any better chance against the Borg and would have still been destroyed.

(apparently there were two USS Melbourne ships at Wolf 359, an Excelsior Class and a Nebula Class. The Nebula Class was to replace the older ship and was to be the one Riker took command. Both were sent and both were destroyed)

In addition, if Riker took command of the Melbourne, Shelby would have ended up as Acting Captain on the Enterprise when Picard was taken and turned into Locutus. She was smart and quick thinking, but she didn't have the experience (wasn't ""seasoned"") like Riker and she didn't know the crew and the ship like Riker did. She didn't know Picard/Locutus like Riker did. She also didn't know her or the crews limits and would keep pushing them to exhaustion.

Chances are, Riker and the Melbourne would have been killed/destroyed and the Enterprise wouldn't have stopped the Cube and Earth would have been Assimilated.

So good on ya Riker.... You dodged that bullet."
0,"[Theory]
Watched Revenge of the Sith (yet again) realized something new. The repeatedly memed moment where Mace Windu tells Anakin that he is granted membership to the council but is denied the rank of master is essentially a test of how he will react. In the film, as Anakin reacts rather negatively Lucas shows us shots of looks being exchanged between Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Mace Windu of disappointment. By making his anger clear, Anakin shows that he is immature and doesn't really deserve the rank of master yet. It is, dare I say, ironic."
1,It seems like almost every season of deep space nine had an O'Brian must suffer episode.  So why did they think it was necessary to torture O'Brian?  Even before deep space nine O'Brian saw a lot of combat in the war with the cardassians.  In one episode it was mentioned that he had been in two hundred and thirty five separate engagements.  That man has seen some action.  And that was before the domion war.  So it seemed like they decided to pick on the man who had seen the most shit and tried to torture him some more.  So why did they hate O'Brian?

0,"So what LFL wasn't able to get across in that bad character description is that Leoxi is a beach bum. He is a dyed in the wool cliche peace and love hippie who would be living in a van with shag carpets by a beach if he could stay in one place long enough. He's also constantly chewing on spice sticks, even while flying at times. 

His whole introduction has him painted as someone who even the Masters find odd and who thinks a half open shirt and a bead necklace is perfect formal wear. Also later on in the story we find out he may not have always been a peace loving hippie. 

And in his own high words here is why the Vessel is called that 

""She grinned and pointed her thumb at the door. “Of course not. I’m the copilot, Affie Hollow. He’s the pilot.”

A teenage copilot seemed questionable to Reath, but when he looked in the direction she was pointing, all those questions vanished, replaced by far more pressing ones. Questions like: Is that man’s shirt open to the waist? Is he holding out his arms to us like he wants a group hug? Does he want a group hug? Is that guy on spice? No—how much spice is that guy on?

“Beautiful children,” said the pilot, with a laconic drawl and a huge grin. “I’m Leox Gyasi, and I hereby welcome you to the vessel.”

There was a brief pause, which made Reath feel better; even experienced Jedi weren’t totally sure how to approach this guy. Dez finally stepped forward with his usual charm. “Dez Rydan. A pleasure to know you. What’s the name of your ship?”

Leox and Affie shared a glance, clearly in on a joke that was about to be sprung. “Already told ya,” Leox said. He was a tall, tan, and rangy human, and his wavy dark blond hair looked as though it might not have been combed recently. Possibly ever. “Our vessel is called…the Vessel. I named it not for the container itself, but the space within the container that gives it its value and purpose. To remind me to look beyond the obvious, you know?”

That sounds like Master Yoda on spice, Reath thought. Which was either a very good sign or a very, very bad one.""

So yeah even the jedi find it crazy. I personally like the name given that a space hippie is the one who named it."

I opened them both up to the first page and realized that they were totally different stories. So now I've learned that there's more than one DV series (2015 and 2020 I think) so I won't make that mistake in the future.

How do you guys know the difference in each series? Do you have to check the author on every one or is there a way to check the print date? I've googled this question but all I get is how to determine the series number, cover, and print. So nothing on the date. Maybe this is all a stupid question but I'm a little discouraged because I had 1-17 in the series and I was excited to get into it and now I'm realizing I might have two different stories confused."

0,"Hello there! I have finished the Ahsoka novel today. Can somebody give me suggestions for the next book? I have watched TCW and Rebels. Also is there any continuity between the books? If so, please guide me, fellow redditors."
0,"I watched the Mandalorian because it initially looked interesting, and Ahsoka had white lightsabers. I know that she got a hold of the Kyber crystals from an Inquisitor and purified them from the Dark Side of the force, hence them being white. In the Clone Wars,  which I started watching after season 2 of the Mandalorian, her lightsabers are green and yellow(?).  I've been consistently watching the Clone Wars now and I am on season 7. I have not gotten to Rebels yet, but I will watch that next. But in watching season 7, Anakin gives Ahsoka back her lightsabers before she goes to Mandalore. And when she ignites them, they are blue, not the green and yellow they were before she left the Jedi Order.

For clarification, I believe that the colors of her lightsabers are green for her main and more of a yellow-green, more yellow than green, for her secondary. Please correct me if I am wrong.

But my question is, why did her first set of lightsabers go from the green and yellow to both being blue? I'm fine with spoilers if that's where the answer comes from."

0,"Hey guys, so I've read a handful of the star wars novels, and was looking for any recommendations of what to get next. Also with the range of different authors out there doing EU content, I was wondering if anybody had opinions on which authors tended to produce the better books.

I've read 6 books so far, 3 of which were by James Luceno (Darth Plagueis, Labyrinth of evil, and the rise of Darth Vader). I thought these novels were great and would highly recommend all of them, but the first two in particular were done very well.

Then there is 'outbound flight' by Timothy Zahn, and 'the approaching storm' by Alan Dean Forster. Again, I would recommend both these books as they were very interesting reads. I wouldn't rate either as highly as the James Luceno books, however, I have heard good things about both authors and would be more than willing to buy more of their books, if any were recommended.

Finally was 'revenge of the sith', by Matthew Stover. I was initially not expecting much due to the fact that it's a movie novelisation, but it actually ended up being my favourite book. Fantastically written. It adds a lot of depth that wasn't captured in the movie, and I couldn't recommend it enough to any prequel fans. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that Matthew Stover has done much else in the way of star wars novels.

So if anybody would recommend any further novels or specific authors I would appreciate the insight. I'm not as interested in content surrounding the sequel era, though would happily give anything a chance if it comes highly recommended. Thanks"
0,"This just hit me today. So as we all know Kylo Ren is obsessed with his grandfather or at least his grandfather's sith persona. However he doesn't learn that Anakin Skywalker was Darth Vader until after the Bloodline novel (six years before the movie) and a few months before the Rise of Kylo Ren comic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up we know that Palpatine/Snoke was sending nightmares to Ben and that Snoke and Ben were even having full on conversations (at times while Ben was sitting only inches away from Luke in the passenger seat of a shuttle) and that Ben would talk to him about how he was feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its not until the Galaxy learns in Bloodline that Vader is Anakin Skywalker and her father that Ben learns. And then in less than a year the fight in the hut happens with Palpatine destroying the temple, Ben going to snoke who sends him to the Knights of Ren, Ben taking over the Knights of Ren, and then finally Ben going to endor and getting all of Vader's relics and going back to be the face of the First Order when it reappears a year after Bloodline. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if Ben doesn't learn about Vader being Anakin untill he's 23 what did they tell him all those years growing up about Anakin?

&amp;#x200B;

Well they can't really bring up anything in the GCW dealing with Anakin without bringing up Vader nor can they talk about redeeming Vader that much without bringing up Anakin. So that would leave them with just talking about Anakin during the clone wars and like Owen and Beru told Luke saying that he died at the end of the Clone Wars. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would also bring in the question of Anakin's force ghost. We know from a lore book (The Secrets of the Jedi) that Anakin's ghost visited. So either the ghost just never talked to Ben or Ghost!Anakin agreed to not tell Ben that he was once Darth Vader to appease his son and daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I guess Ben would have had to grow up hearing that Anakin Skywalker died in the Clone Wars and being told that Darth Vader was just some random Sith Lord who his uncle was able to convince to betray Darth Sidious."

It tastes like different things for every crewmember. Maybe Riker or Geordi thinks the fruit tastes like a burger. I remember it was really amusing and I'd love to watch it again. Does anyone know if this is actually an episode or if my brain has fabricated this out of deep space?"
1,"Had this idea for an episode the other day. Tell me your thoughts!

Pike the USS Enterprise are on a routine mission where they encounter a Klingon ship sending out a distress call. They get onboard and discover what appears to be humans who claim to be Klingons. They take them back to the Enterprise, and the medical scans show that although they physically look human, they are in fact biologically Klingon, easily detectable on scanners.

Pike has a call with Commodore Robert April. Pike tells April how confused he is, because the only human looking Klingon that he knew of is Ash Tyler, but Tyler is biologically human - this is something different. April tells Pike he thinks he knows someone and tells the Enterprise to go to a Starbase.

The USS Enterprise arrive at the Starbase and are delighted and surprised when Admiral Jonathan Archer, along with Dr Phlox beam aboard. Archer is long retired, having last been aboard a starship when the USS Enterprise launched under the command of Robert April. He has since been living comfortably, although supported by many medical apparatus. Dr Phlox had been teaching at Starfleet Academy, but had taken a sabbatical to care for his old friend.

Pike asks Archer what is so important that he had to come himself, instead of just sending information. Archer reveals to Pike top secret classified information - that about a century prior, a group of Klingons had experimented with Augmentation, based on human augments, and had changed their physical appearance. Luckily, this did not spread to the entirety of Klingon society, and those who were ridgeless were shut out, made into a despised labour class, one that was kept from the rest of the galaxy. Some Klingons who suffered the Augment Virus were able to undertake physical reconstruction surgery to look Klingon, although that wasn't available to all.

Archer speaks to the Klingons, who reveal to him and Pike that a world has literally turned into a rotten place even by Klingon standards, and that smooth-heads are forced into slave labour for the chance to get the cure which is being worked on by the Qo'nos.

The Enterprise requests diplomatic envoy to Qo'nos, and meet with L'Rell, who reveals that these worlds are known to Klingons, and that they are a test to show that these Klingons still deserve their ridges. Dr Phlox asks about the cure, which they discovery stopped research decades ago. It appears that there was a decision by the High Council to keep them as a labour class. L'Rell, upon discovering this, put production right back into schedule, and they ask Dr Phlox to stay to help. At first Phlox says no because he is looking after Archer, but Archer tells him that he could help an entire species of people again, and that is more important than just one man. L'Rell makes a decision that smooth-head Klingons would no longer be in hiding, and that those who have proven themselves, even without ridges, can serve Qo'nos and command starships.

The USS Enterprise returns to federation space, and are informed that a ship will meet with them to pick up Admiral Archer. On the bridge of the Enterprise, Archer makes a comment about how he has missed things, and that he likes the feel of this ship, how the buttons and dials are how a starship should be run, not from just touchscreens. Pike quips that maybe all ships will be back to that sometime soon. Ops informs Pike and Archer that Archer's ship has arrived. Pike takes a look to the viewscreen, comments how it is a nice ship. Archer thanks him, goes to the turbolift, and the doors close on him.

Doors open on the Turbolift on the NX01 Enterprise bridge, and Admiral Archer walks on to the bridge. He looks around to the bridge, at unknown officers sitting at Science, Communications, Helm, and Tactical, and the empty chair at the centre of the bridge. As he approaches the chair and puts a hand on it, he hears his name being called and turns to see Ambassador T'Pol. ""I see you got my message."" Archer says to his friend. T'Pol simply nods, saying that she was on a diplomatic mission, but when Admiral Archer asks you to quickly re-commission a museum ship, you listen.

Archer takes a seat in the captain's chair, and with T'Pol on his side, looks forward out the viewscreen. In space, we see the Enterprise NX-01, in it's full refit glory with secondary hull, float by and above the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 as both vessels warp off into the stars."

Filoni defends these films like they are his own creation and gives credit to those who moved him toward live action. In the end JJ and Johnson had to complete the vision. JJ was mostly left alone, and Johnson worked heavily from Lucas’ notes and the story group. We know the Rose and Finn storyline was created in a third draft that Kennedy requested so they could add a new female character. In the end, these directors take the responsibility, but Filoni seems to have had a lot of influence on what was done. I wonder how much.

0,So for a while I’ve been trying to find out how much each republic credit ingot is worth. I might have nearly got my answer from the clone wars but not completely  because in the episode where C3-PO and R2-D2 are sent to but jogan fruit (I don’t know if that’s how you spell it) they are charged 32 republic credits. I believe if you look closely you can see them handing 1 gold ingot and 2 silver ingots to the person selling them the fruit. I come to some what of a conclusion that a gold ingot is worth around 16 republic credits and the silver ingots are worth about 8. But I need confirmation and I also need to know how much a bronze ingot is worth.

0,"I want to preface this by saying I have been a huge Star wars fan since the 80's  I loved the original movies, was not to impressed by the special editions.  I read every Star Wars book written for a while.  I like the prequels but thought they were flawed in the same way the special edition of the originals were.  I did not particularly like the sequel movies but they hit some fun Star wars notes.  After watching two seasons of Mandalorian I decided it was time to give the animated content a try as I felt I was missing out on some references ( I had no idea how many) .  After watching through all of the Clone wars and then Rebels, I honestly feel betrayed by the sequel movies.  They had so much lore to build on.  So many cool things about neutral force users, animals and even Planets connected to the force in interesting ways.  And they throw all that out for a mediocre retelling of the originals.  I can't express how disappointed I am.  I now understand all the salty feelings on this subreddit.  I get it now."
1,"There are a number of great articles around the web that discuss how the public in general has misperceived Captain Kirk in terms of being a rebel, a womanizer, or space cowboy etc.  I think these articles are spot on. When watching the original series Kirk reputation for violating the prime directive is also shown to be an exaggeration.  In most cases he has a legal excuse for doing so.  

Excuse #1 The Klingons or some pre-Prime Directive Earth ship has caused a mass interference with this culture's development.  The rules say I can correct the imbalance from prior interference so I am going to do that. Examples A Private Little War, A Piece of the Action

Excuse #2 Technically the Prime Directive only applies to *developing* cultures this culture is *stagnant*.  The computer that rules them will not allow the people to grow I am going to destroy it to free them to *develop* again.  Examples The Return of the Archons and The Apple

However there was one episode where the Kirk decided to forgo the prime directive because he just doesn't like what he sees.  That is  A Taste of Armageddon.  The two planets Eminiar VII and Vendikar have been at war for over 800 years.  They have sanitized it so that when attacks happen they are simulated by computer.  This way they have no physical damage but every one who was in the simulated attack now must commit suicide.  These two cultures are allowed to grow and continue with an acceptable causality list every year.  Kirk is appalled so he decides to destroy it.   In my review I wrote: 

&gt;You can try to make excuses and blame Fox for creating the situation or invoke the right of self-defense when Anan and the rest of Eminar tried to kill the crew of the Enterprise.   Those excuses however can only be used to justify the Kirk doing just enough to rescue the Ambassador and get back to the Enterprise and have an escape.  Kirk goes much farther than that he is altering the course of two neighboring worlds with a shared history.  He demands they change at gunpoint or he will destroy their civilization himself.  Captain Kirk has decided that there is something about this developing society that he does not like and has decided to change it, so much for the Prime Directive.

There was a Star Trek that mentioned this episode, I forget which book, but I remember in the novel Spock's father Sarek brings it up.  He states Starfleet Command and the Federation Council shared Kirk's feeling about how awful the situation was and decided to let it slide. (That tiny detail is another reason why the books can be awesome.)

Note: I haven't seen the TOS season finale. I just couldn't get through S3.

All good things is fine, I like the Q part, but overall it just felt like a regular episode. 

What we leave behind was so rushed. They had a nine part episode ending thing but they couldn't find the time to give Dukat an actual death. Also Sisko just abandoned his child wtf??

Endgame suffers from the syndrome I call ""The Trek writers wrote an episode but forgot to make it interesting"". It's also way to rushed.

These are the voyages is astonishingly bad. I don't even know how to express it in words. It's just so terrible. My worst problem with it is that it just skipped ahead 6 years??? Like, why???

That Hope is You, Part II isn't a series finale but it might as well be. I actually really like Disco, and this seemed like the end of the show. I'm excited for more, but when the TOS credits rolled, I thought 'you know what? I'm ok with this being the end of the show'. If that was a series finale, it would be the first good one yet."

1,"I've just watched the VOY episode ""Darkling"" and it was intense. This episode is obliviously inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and I love that Picardo can change performances on the fly, becoming evil and sadistic and becoming the little goody two-shoes Doctor that we all know and love, and I love that you can tell them apart from his performances, and I also love the message of the episode, that man has a light and dark side and that learning to live with both makes us who and what we are.

A little criticism, the contact lens that they made Picardo wear during his evil persona was unnecessary because Picardo's performance was convincing already, the robe was enough."

The thing is, Qui-Gon never completed his Force Ghost training and can only manifest himself as a disembodied voice, so we wouldn't see his face. That would feel dissapointing to some, so what if,...

Kenobi has to undergo the same trial by the Force Priestesses Yoda did, and in his vision, he's back on the Jedi Temple in Coruscant. He's training his new padawan when Anakin comes along and greets them. Obi Wan introduces him as ""The man who ended the Sith"". To which Anakin replies ""Master Windu ended the Sith, I simply helped."" 

""Well, you had a good master."" Obi Wan says.

""Talking of me behind my back, Master Kenobi?"" 

It's Qui-Gon Jinn. Obi Wan appears surprised for a second, then smiles and invites him to the conversation. They discuss politics, with Anakin praising the work of Chancellor Amidala in helping the separatist planets rebuild after the Clone Wars. 

""Peace and justice finally reign on the Republic,"" Anakin says. ""It's hard to believe.""

0," In my fanfiction, I have a Dathomirian Jedi. She's still a youngling at the time of this event, but is it possible she could have a similar feeling to what Luke felt on Dagobah before he went to Bespin? And if she told the Order about what she foresaw, would they do anything, and what could the outcome be if they did? It's a shame she's too young to attend the battle, though.

The most obvious possibility I see is capturing/killing Grievous way earlier, maybe get some information about Dooku's motives. But how would it affect the relationship between the Jedi and Opress &amp; Ventress, if at all? Future connotations would also obviously include a lot less hostility from Merrin towards Cal Kestis, which might possibly include finding the Astrium significantly earlier, and that could even lead to safely obtaining the Bogano holocron long before the Empire discovers the planet, meaning the holocron never gets stolen.

In any case, I'd love to know exactly what would happen if the Jedi knew about the Battle of Dathomir, depending on whether they would interfere."

D'tan talks about befriending the federation and the klingon empire to aid us against the Tal shiar, to work with Remans,I never seen one growing up on Virinat but have heard from Tamer that we, Romulans, used to be cruel them. Great as of trying to befriend the two governments our people have a history of betraying wasn't bad enough, we also have to show a species we once enslaved that were not the same romulans as our ancestors. Oh and if that's not enough I'VE BEEN MADE CAPTAIN! I never left Virinat until a day ago now I'm captain of a warbird fighting against elite soldiers. Elements, end log."
1,"The prototype ship in Voyager: Message in a bottle, has to be just about the most bad ass ship design in Star Fleet.  Not only can it run on full auto mode, but it has MULTI-VECTOR ASSAULT MODE.  This should be standard for all Federation vessels.  Just get rid of the EMH Mark II and it's a perfect ship."

1,"Honestly, I'm on my first rewatch since it aired and I'm having a great time (currently almost finished with season 1), not only because:

* I get to see more of Jeffrey Combs
* I get to see the evolution of the transporter from cargo only to humans
* I get to see phasers being installed and improved upon (and used)
* I get to see force fields being developed and refined
* I also happen to like hearing Archer say ""Polarize hull plating!""
* I get to see EVEN MORE of Jeffrey Combs, as he's also playing a Ferengi in addition to Shran!
* Plus there's Ethan Philipps in that same episode!
* And the next episode has René Auberjonois!
* Then there's one with Dean Stockwell... and it's pretty good by itself, Dean being in it is just a bonus.
* Ok, I'll say it... it has an amazing intro (including the music)

Come on, what's not to like?!    
And I distinctly remember it getting even better."
1,"This is a crazy idea but

I really do think the internet has fundamentally altered human civilization, and the period of lightning fast tumult we've entered won't slow down for many generations until essentially every major institution has been reformed for this new mode of human interaction.  Government, schools, medical, its all a matter of time (the only question is whether or not we can survive til then).  

Now, that being said - it occurred to me that the way the internet has swept across the globe?  It reminds me of the way the Prime Directive gets violated.  As far as I know the US government and military are the ones that developed the internet and turned it into what it is today.  And then that advanced level of technology is disseminated to every culture on earth - whether or not that culture is capable of responsibly handling it (which is not to say that America is ready or responsible!).  But do you see what I mean..?  The internet is like an interruption to the natural development of other cultures - and since Trek is naught but geopolitics anyway, seems like a fitting comparison."
1,"Since Day 1 from Disco S1 I have always felt that there is something making Discovery feel less serious despite supposedly exploring darker themes reflecting some of our troubled world today.   
At first I could not tell the reason, but after having just binge watched The Expanse a few weeks ago and re-exploring some other Treks again, I start to realize perhaps it is the speed and voice pitch that makes words ""missing weight"" ?

SMG for example - her emotional acting (a lot of people dislikes Burnham crying all the time but I am ok with it tho) and action scenes I would definitely give good marks. However imho she definitely speaks too fast and too high-octave in many important scenes and moral arguments. Sometimes that really makes me forget she was supposed to be Vulcan-trained and highly analytical as a science officer.

Imho a great acting contrast to this is Mary Wiseman as Tilly, since she is portrayed as socially awkward so speaking fast would actually work in favour of her character's realism. When she plays Killy, who obviously is more firm and confident, she would speak slower and slightly low-pitched and it really gives me the cold-blood sensation.

While a lot of people dislike Discovery and I absolutely agree it is not the best Trek compared to past series, I still enjoyed it greatly and still am glad that the story can continue. However I really want to see S4 scenes to feel ""heavier"" both in terms of plot, and the way it is vocally delivered."
1,"More of a curiosity than anything else, but I, myself, never really liked what they were going for with the introduction of Wesley in TNG, regardless of increased viewership, and I'm curious if there's an edit of the show that removes the character entirely.

Can't say I'm not enticed to see TNG without him, though. Does an edit like that exist?"
0,"Ok, so we obviously no pretty much nothing about Yoda's Species, apart from three things: what they look like, that there appear to be very few of them, and that each one that we know of is super powerful in the Force. Now, those last two are particularly important. We've never seen another species in Star Wars quite like this, one that is so rare, and so powerful in the Force, but, what if the cause of one is the cause of the other. The theory that I can up with is that each member of the Species, is almost created by the Force itself at a focal point for the Force. So, Yoda is around 900 at the time of the Prequels, and Mace Windu refers to the Sith becoming extinct around a millennia ago. Well, what if this number is slight off, and it was around, say, 900 years ago. The supposed destruction of the Sith, the rise of the Light and the Jedi and the Republic for the next near-millennia is a pretty huge event, and certainly a focal point, not just for the Galaxy, but for the Force. We also have Grogu, born in the exact same year as 'The Chosen One', Anakin Skywalker. That is one of, if not the biggest game changer for the Galaxy, and the Force. And Dave and Jon know their stuff, I doubt that is a coincidence. Finally, we have Yaddle. Well, and I may be wrong about this, she is about 400/450 at the time of TPM. So she'd be about 200 at the time of Light of the Jedi. Could something have happened in that time period? It's completely unexplored, so they could do pretty much anything. Possibly the finding of Hyperspace, or development of it to a commercial degree, that's a pretty major event in Galactic History, and, again, the Force. Or something else? I dunno, this kind of came to me when talking with a friend, what do you guys think?"
1,"Now rewatching this episode and noticed again that production team did a terrific job. 
This is the first time we see inside of a Jem Hadar ship and its upside down. And it seems they have tought design of all set pieces accordingly just for one episode.

0,"In a New Hope, both the original and special editions, there is some sort of vehicle in a shot of Luke outside of the Mos Eisley Cantina. It's not the Ubrikkian 9000, but to the right of it from the camera's POV. I've been scouring google and wikipedia forever trying to get an answer. It almost looks more like a one man spacecraft than a landspeeder. 

I included a link, at the vehicle can be seen at the 1:48 mark, right behind Luke. Looks like it belongs to a spacer hanging out in front of it. 

I would be so very grateful for any information!

1,"I'm almost halfway through the series and I've seen episodes featuring the actors who play Quark, Odo, Barclay, Troi, and Q. I believe there might be others but I can't think of them at the moment. I don't know why I enjoy seeing them play other characters so much but it's strangely entertaining (especially seeing Quark play a weird magical space hippie or Troi play a Russian agent). Are there any other shows that feature a ton of Trek alumni? I know a lot of them lend their voices to the Gargoyles cartoon but that's not exactly the same."
1,"So I watched Future Imperfect last night, I chose it because I didn't remember the episode very well and I actually quite enjoyed the rewatch, it was an interesting and kind episode.

But it has made me wonder what happened to the alien Barush (sp?) after Riker took him back to the Enterprise. I tried a quick google search but didn't come up with any information of a repeat appearance in the show (nor do I remember one) or any novels or so that mention him.

It's still bothering me though that I don't have this further info, so I thought I would ask the question here, maybe someone knows of a novel that continues his story or has imagined what became of him?"

1,"I just have a little question for anyone who may know, or can offer some explanation.

In TNG they reach or surpass warp 10 and remain generally unaffected. But in voyager they got mega messed up. Why is it different? Is it because of one being a shuttle and the other a star ship?

I completely understand the nuances of writing and, probably just comes down to the writers wanting to write about it but couldn't really do it in voyager successfully since that would have essentially ended the series there and then, but just found myself curious."

0,"Hear me out, Tamson was an antagonist for only 3 episode of the entire Clone Wars show, but he did so much compared to other villains in the show. Yeah, he was meant to lose, but he cause a civil war on Mon Calamari, he beat the clone and Mon Cala, also beat the gungan and beat Kit Fisto (a Jedi in the council) and capture Padme, Jar Jar and Anakin.

1,"So I just watched the two parter where Worf goes to get the Klingons back and the Enterprise is docked at DS9. From the DS9 Pilot we learn that Sisko probably was transported on the Enterprise, since it takes place at the same time. We see how chaotic DS9 is and how anything barely functions.

But in the TNG episode everything seems clean and functioning.

The artwork is incredible, Especially the backdrops,

1,"I'm reading Carl Sagan's *Contact* and all of the chapters begin with various quotes. One of them comes from Hamlet, II, ii, 628: ""The devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape"".


I, of course, read that in Martia's voice, who says the latter part after she reveals her changeling self. With the Shakespearean connections in the movie, it's obviously not a coincidence.


Besides the direct quotes at the dinner and Chang's diatribe at the end, are there any other examples of Shakespeare dialogue in STVI?"
1,"I do realize there's a good number of people who love the Orville's humor, but i think it's not controversial to say that a lot of people don't. I am one of those people, and I wondered, after watching Lower Decks (and really enjoying it) what the difference is for me. Both portray humor in a Star Trek(-like) setting, often involving physical pranks and crudity.

I think I finally figured it out: it's essentially in the name, ""Lower Decks"". Having interacted with a lot of Army soldiers through my work life, I know the combination of youth and abject boredom that causes them to do crazy shit. That's the setting of Lower Decks, young officers who often work menial tasks and need an outlet for their boredom.

The Orville however plays entirely on the Bridge, these are all senior officers with lengthy careers behind them, and to behave like that is entirely incongruent with their characters. There **is** humor on real-life command bridges, but it is humor within strict bounds that don't get violated.

So yeah, I think that's what rubbed me the wrong way about Orville's humor: it isn't believable, it pulls me out of the show. In contrast, the humor in Lower Decks pulls me **into** the show, because it creates believable characters."
0,"I really enjoyed the Force Unleashed games (especially the first), and I'd really like to see them added back to the canon. It's a great origin story for the Rebellion, and an epic story of how Vader's apprentice learned to overcome his hatred and attachment to the Dark Side and become a true Jedi (this has to be the case because Vader and the rebel leaders are all alive in the original trilogy). I also enjoyed characters like Juno, Proxy, and Kota. 

Anyone else want The Force Unleashed to be canon again?"
1,"Just before the ship went back in time there was a scene where a window blew open by the command centre on Earth. 

The crew went back in time and introduced that man to ""Transparant Aluminium"", which of course changes the timeline a bit because he now has knowledge that wasn't available so far in the past.

Now when the crew head back the move basically played the exact same scene where the window blew up. 

I think they missed a really good chance here to suggest just how important this action was. What they should have done is change that scene so that the window didn't break, and some ennsign somewhere could have said something jokingly like ""damn. thats some mightly fine glass....."" or something.

This would have been such a genius easter egg/funny scene."

1,"I've been rewatching TNG trying to get a feel for the rank structure of Starfleet compared to earth military ranks.  I can't figure out if Academy is like OCS and you come out as an officer with an ensign's rank or if the ensigns are the equivalent of enlisted personnel.  Also then you have people like O'Brien with the rank of ""Chief"" that seems to through a wrench in the whole system."
1,"I watched TMP in 2001 when I was 16 years old, and I loved it, it was my first exposure to TOS since I've never watched TOS, my first exposure to Trek in the early 90s was TNG, DS9 and VOY, although my first exposure to Kirk was Generations.

TMP was a visually stunning film in my opinion, I love the design of the V'ger exterior as the Enterprise enters the cloud. I love the Enterprise refit design, that's probably because I wasn't exposed to the TOS Enterprise, and what made me love the design was the Enterprise flyby, I love the score of the movie, especially the music for the Enterprise flyby and the V'ger entry, its a breathe taking score in my opinion.

I love the interaction between Spock, McCoy and Kirk, and this was my first true introduction to Spock and McCoy, yes I have seen them in TNG, but I didn't truly know who they are really when I was 10 years old.

I love the story of V'ger, for me it's very compelling, a machine trying to find its Creator, I find it compelling because it speaks to our human need to find meaning I'm our own lives, that is why we turn to religion, since our questions, who created us and is this all that I am, these questions cannot be asked by science, but by religion, so in a way, this makes V'ger's struggle relatable somewhat."
1,"Probably unpopular, but I love the mirror universe. It's brutal, everyone dresses well and the actors clearly love playing the characters. I adore it.

0,"Telling the different between clones and stormtroopers can be difficult, especially if you are new to Star Wars. 

Here is a tip. 

Clones are from before Order 66. They are the good guys that worked along side the Jedi (Obi Wan, Anikan, Mace Windu, Yoda, etc) 

Storm troopers are from after Order 66. These are the ones that Rex claims to have ""junk armour"" in Rebels. They are the bad guys that don't fight along side the Jedi. They fight with the Empire. 

They also may have other slight differences in armour. For example, Clones were allowed to add color to their armour. The color usually tells about themselves, ranks, etc. Stormtroopers always have white armour, so you can't tell who's who."

1,"Wow what a fantastic episode, I was waiting for the show to pick on my first TOS watch through and starting to lose hope that it would but this episode might be better than any TNG episode and was well worth the wait.  An intense 40 minute cat and mouse chase through space between the Enterprise and the Romulan Flagship vessel on the border of the neutral zone with some great acting by both captains.  The Romulan captain also played Sarek in TNG.  

You actually get to see the enterprise have the upper hand for the majority of the chase peppering the area of the cloaked Romulan ship with phaser fire and wearing them down bit by bit, and the Romulans trying to resort to some dirty tricks to throw them off course or destroy them with a nuke.  Also the wedding at the beginning of the episode that was interrupted then never came to pass.  I need some time to take that all in before I continue my watch through."
0,"Given that Obi Wan was apparently qualified to be a General, and other Jedi were leading units of clone troopers, is it fair to assume that Jedi have some level of military command training? I’d pit a Jedi against any soldier they’d come across, but personal combat is not the same as command.

Revan seemed competent enough a military mind in his time as well; is it possible that being strong in the Force leads naturally into higher level strategic thinking? Or possibly the Masters can just “feel” who’d be naturally good at it."
1,"Throughout season 3, Degra and Archer have kind of a special dynamic compared to the other Xindi (except maybe Gralik but he's different) in that they don't hate each other, but they don't like each other either. 

However, there's one episode i can recall where Degra, under an uneasy alliance with Archer who previously presented evidence counter to what the Xindi were told, was upset with Archer about having to blow up a Reptilian ship, then in the same breath he blows up the Reptilian ship after all, saying he doesn't want to risk the other Xindi finding out about his truce with Archer.

We know that Degra was expressing doubts about the weapon, confiding to an unnamed Arboreal that there were children on Earth and he's scared of destroying the planet out of concern for his own children.

Archer tells T'Pol, after returning to Enterprise unharmed from the Aquatic ship, that he got through to ""one of them,"" meaning Degra.

When asked by Tucker about Degra's loyalty, Archer says,

&gt; He may not be on our side, but I'm sure that he's starting to question his.

Finally, after calling a cease fire, Degra boards Enterprise to tell Archer his plan. The meeting comes to an end with Archer offering to shake Degra's hand, therefore making the truce permanent. Degra even sympathizes with Archer, promising that Enterprise will return to being a ship of exploration soon enough.

How can Degra go from hating Archer to liking him in just one short year?"

I'm looking for Star Trek fans in Edmonton Alberta Canada to join and launch a chapter of STARFLEET International.  
 It's an international fan club for Star Trek.  
 The organization was created in 1974 and has chapters ""Ships"" around the world.

Our mission is to engage with our Edmonton community, share our interests with others and host our own events.

This a fact finding mission in hopes to recruit non-commissioned and commissioned crew.

The next step would be recruit other Star Trek fans who would be interested in Starfleet Marines or the MACO division of Starfleet.

This will be a slow and productive building process.   
 There are many steps to commission and launch a ship.   
 There is a time and effort commitment.   
 The time spent and friendships made will be worth it.

Please join our community r/STARFLEET_Edmonton to review our current processes and steps.   
 The sub is closed for general submissions but each thread has ample information and questions are welcomed.   
 Upon reviewing of our sub and you chose to commit to joining please send an e-mail to

I’m one of those few who like the more elegant design of the Kelvin timeline, so it would be interesting to know what something like a Miranda-class would look like in the Kelvin timeline, and I can’t help but imagine what a Galaxy-class Enterprise D would look like in the newest style.

The main selling point of this games story is how the main character is absolutely convinced that what he’s doing is a very positive thing and it’s presented in a way that the players (even though we all know the Sith are the bad guys) can’t help but agree with him and actually hope he succeeds in his quest of revenge against the Jedi Order.

They could set this game the Old Republic Era and to make things interesting they could reveal him to be the canon version of Ajunta Pall; the rogue Jedi that kicked off The Hundred Years Darkness."

1,Sapient AI not having been addressed by the mid-24th century stretches belief.
0,In the citadel arc someone (Anakin I think) says the citadel was used/made to hold dark Jedi. This implies that the Jedi and or the republic most likely made and controlled it. So how did it end up in separatist hand?
0,Hi so I was just wondering about the Star Wars order. So I watched Phantom Menace attack of the clones and revenge of the Sith what comes next and after that? What’s the order of the movies?
1,"I just finished the entirety of DS9...and it was very, very sad. The ending of TNG was sort of just...abrupt, so this ending was jarring and emotion-inducing. I cried. For sure. 

I was jarred and possibly a bit angry about Odo going off to live with the other changelings. I was very disappointed about this choice since Odo basically went through four or five similar character arcs, though it did make sense for his character. The only thing that did make me sad was that Kira and he had just gotten together (basically). So that was sort of a hammer to that subplot, even though their goodbye was beautiful. Also, Colonel Kira as the new station's Odo is a good touch. 

I can't believe that they would replace the magnificent Jadzia Dax with Ezri, who's just...I dislike Ezri. And by that I mean I really don't like her. I think I would have liked her better if they introduced her sooner, but she just didn't stick with me and was not a good replacement for Jadzia. But I guess I'm happy for Julian or whatever. 

Speaking of which, I love the bromance between Bashir and O'Brien. They make me so happy with their manchild bonding activities (not to mention that they remind me of Troy and Abed from Community). It was pretty heartbreaking when they broke up. But I liked it, and it was a good end to an amazing friendship. (Though I was pretty torn up about it.) 

And lastly, the Sisko part of the ending. Marrying Cassidy Yates was really sweet, but I still don't get it that the Prophets said that she would bring him to ruin? And that he needs to walk the path alone? Like, I understand, but how did she do that, exactly? Cassidy was obviously upset about it all, but Sisko didn't seem that fazed by the end of it. 

Also, they gave her a baby, just so that he would never see it? Furthermore,  why would they give Cassidy a baby, just so we show watchers would never see it? That makes me even sadder that DS9 is done. 

But I did enjoy the finale, even with my complaining. I always loved Dukat. And I still think...no never mind, I don't know who is my favorite captain: Picard or Sisko. Tell me in the comments who you think is better and your personal thoughts on the DS9 finale!"
0,"I grew up on both the OT and PT in the early 2000s, and I think the abundance of Star Wars games in that period really pulled me into the universe just as much as the movies did. Between Kotor, Jedi Outcast, Battlefront, and many others, it really made random places like Nar Shaddaa seem as real as a planet like Coruscant that is way more fleshed out in the movies. And even then, my experiences with Coruscant go back to memories like flying around as Jango in the Bounty Hunter game. In those days, the universe just felt so much more alive and connected. When I'm reading new Star Wars books, I can't help but go back and listen to the old game soundtrack to take me back to feel like I'm in that world again. What about you?"
0,"Really wish they went with something that didn't look as cartoony and cheap. It did improve a lot, and the difference between the final episodes from the Clone wars to the first are gargantuan. But still, the weird look of the characters put me off from watching them for a while, anyone else feel this way?"
1,"Found out about this from Twitter. [startrek.com](https://startrek.com) is looking for stories for April. There's a [full list of topics they're looking for,](https://www.startrek.com/Pitching) but some of them stood out for me:

* First Contact Day
* World Autism Awareness Day
* Harry Kim
* ""Captain's Holiday""
* ""In the Pale Moonlight""

I'm not a writer, but I'm sure somebody here would be interested."
0,"There's been something that always bugged me about the clones, in star wars lore, for a long time. And for quite a while, I always believed it was the reason that the Empire eventually switched to natural born recruits. Wouldn't the Clone armies be vulnerable to an epidemic?

The clones are all genetically identical--barring a few occasional defects--so, wouldn't that mean they have the exact same immune systems? Isn't one of the prime concerns of cloning in general, the lack of variability in immune systems?

In the case of natural birth--when a disease hits, some may die, and others may survive. 

But in the case of clones--if a virus is lethal for one of them, it's lethal to all of them! None may survive exposure, because all of their immune systems are the same! One pathogen that can a clone's immune system can't resist, than none of them can!

&amp;#x200B;

So... What happened? From what I've observed in lore, that never really happened. What factor prevented them from being wiped out by a single pandemic (besides space, of course)?"
0,"For twenty-two years everyone has hated The Phantom Menace. Going in I thought it was going to be Tommy Wiseau-style bad.  I actually enjoyed it a lot. 

Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid give really good performances. Thespian Terence Stamp could have been better utilized though. 

Natalie Portman was wooden though. Jake Lloyd was just a kid, people criticize him unfairly IMHO. 

The politics was more interesting than the kid stuff, but I think Star Wars is for kids. The final duel between Maul and Liam Neeson is phenomenal!! 

Maybe I went in having extremely low expectations and so I enjoyed it, but it was not a terrible movie by any means. 

Thoughts?"
1,"I am recently watching a bunch of OS movies on youtube, and it l realize I would love to have a good  copy of TWoK. Is there a specific one you would recommend?"
0,As far as I’m aware they haven’t announced how many episodes it will be. My assumption is that the first season will be six episodes with the hour premier on May 4th and then one 20 minute episode every Friday for the next 5 weeks from May 7th to June 4th. Marvel’s Loki premiers on June 11th so that is the main reason why I expect the show to be done before that. I don’t expect them to play two big shows on Disney+ at once. There will probably be a second season eventually anyways. How many episodes do you think?
1,"Voyager was my gateway into Star Trek in the 90s. I’ve always had a soft spot for it, but understood it has flaws and that there was some hate towards it from the wider Star Trek community. It has some good episodes, explores some interesting concepts, but I understand the criticisms like overusing the Borg and some poor character development.  

However, recently, there have been a lot of pro-voyager posts. Is there a reason why this occurs? Is it just a new generation discovering it? Or just people accepting it for what it was? Frustration with the newer series? 

So, why is there a recent rise in popularity for voyager?"
0,How many episodes are there I am watching the 1st right now because my friends told me to watch it.
0,"Each get fucked over by their master, forge their own path, etc. Are there any other parallels to be made between the two?"
0,"He's such an amazing character. Very sexy and with 4 arms! That means he can carry 4 times as many lightsabres as that smelly obi one kanobi guy.

1,"Hello Star Trek humans,

I felt this is the right place to ask, if not re-direct me and don't kill me please.

I am looking for a moment in the Star Trek series/movies where there is emphasis on a new incoming transmission. I am aware this happens countless times through the series but I am not talking about a 5 second clip of ""New Message"".

 I mean a moment something like this ;

""Captain, we have picked up an unidentified radio signal""

""Patch it through""

What is it, run scans etc etc. My idea is to have this small 20 second clip as an intro for a music mix I am working on which is space themed."
0,I just wanted to ask at what point does the series start to pick up? I’m a few episodes into the first season and it’s a bit slow right now
0,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but going for it.

This year has hit hard, I need to start living outside of confined spaces and be more social. 

I (29, M, vaccinated) am planning to go to Galaxy's Edge in Orlando at the end of April (birthday treat, yay) - I'm traveling alone from NY and unfortunately all my fellow SW enthusiast friends are out of the country. 

Since the SW hype &amp; enthusiasm is 10x better when shared, I'm looking for someone as nerdy as me to go with. It'll be my first time there and my first time in a US Disney park too - been to the one in Paris when I was a kid. 

Would love to chat a bit before committing, I get along with almost everyone I meet but want to make sure we'd enjoy each other's company and not just ruin the experience for both of us. 

Sanity check: sequels are not great, but still enjoyable. The only SW movie I've only seen once is Solo. Rebels has bad visuals, but amazing story and character development. The last season of the Clone Wars is the best one. The Mandalorian was one of the best things to happen to the SW universe. Han shot first."
1,"Why did the Founders turn Odo Human, as opposed to Bajoran? *We* tend to think of humans as the ""default"" in many sci-fi settings, but from Odo's perspective, they are just one of many alien species. It seems completely arbitrary for the Founders to make him Human of all possible species.

Odo is much more likely to view Bajorans as the ""default"" sci-fi species. Odo has lived among Bajorans for most of his life. His appearance is based upon a Bajoran's, hence why his face doesn't have the little indent between the brow ridge and the nose bridge that most humans have. Bajorans don't have that indentation; their nasal ridges run over it. Odo, not being skilled enough to actually form the ridges, has a smooth, straight, Bajoranesque nose. Furthermore, the Founders believe Odo's attachment to his Bajoran friend Kira Nerys to be the main reason for his wanting to be with Solids over them.

So why did they make him physiologically Human? It would make a lot more sense to make him physiologically Bajoran, and this would have taken literally zero extra effort on the part of the make-up departement. All it would have taken is the writers changing a few lines in the script."

0,Are they actually still developing the game or is it cancelled. The last bit of news was in august and they said the game would be released in spring. Now we’re here and we haven’t even gotten a release date. I’m actually kina worried
0,"I saw this at several stores before Christmas, and didn't get it. Then after the holidays it was gone, and I hadn't seen it since. I figured that it was going to be retired and I had lost my chance.

Then this weekend, my sons and I were at Barnes &amp; Noble looking at the Lego sets. My 13-year-old son spotted it behind another large Star Wars Lego set. Even though I had wanted it before, I debated about getting it: at $60, it's a bit pricey for a Lego set and something Star Wars-related. But he talked me into it, and I'm glad he did! He helped me put it together, and it is very cool. The range finder flips down, which is pretty cool too. And behind it in the pics is the Lego ISS, which was a birthday gift to him and he put together (without my help); another neat Lego set.

1,The reason why he is the best is because he can destroy planets and can destroy the entire galaxy
1,I can't think of a better more succinct series of events that showed Starfleet (and eventually the Federation) why it must stay out of the natural development of a species. That is all really.
1,Looking for recommendations on good Star Trek Podcasts...
1,"Because lifeforms in other galaxies won’t be DNA based and won’t originate from an earthly common ancestor, they will look nothing like Earth life. There is no chance that other lifeforms developed similar features to us because the same evolutionary pressures did not occur on other planets. Even the shape of our bodies is totally dependent on the literal atmospheric pressure of this planet. Other lifeforms may just be floating blobs if energy for all we know."
1,"Saru is great and all, some of the best acting and among the most interesting characters in the series, but...

My biggest problem with Saru is his backstory. It sounds like a fanfic or RPG character created by a 12-year-old (and I should know, having created several like this for both fanfics and email RPGs, at/around 12!).

""My character is from a race nobody has ever heard of that has *no* technology but was super smart enough to figure out how to modify stolen technology and call to space, and Starfleet sent a ship across the galaxy *just for him* and he immediately joined Starfleet and was the BEST AT EVERYTHING so was made a senior/bridge officer almost right away because he is so awesome that his inexperience with technology or starships doesn't matter! And then he became Captain!"""
1,"I assume it’s British, but is there a more specific name for this kind of British accent?"
0,"The Season finale makes it seem very likely that the mkIII Dark troopers are able to scan for midichidlorians beings.

SPOILERS...

During the finale fight when we have the dark troopers banging on the blast doors, Gideon grinning ear to ear, and everyone else believing they're about to die... A lone figure comes out of an X- wing!! This causes the whole platoon the diverge from the current misson of of the Child, to take on just one person (??) 

Of course we later find out that this one person is one of the strongest force wielders in the Galaxy. But at the time no one could have known this. Even Gideon appears visibily confused as to why all of the troopers proceeded to change attack plans toward our mystery attacker. Conveniently Gideon is also the first to theorise who the rescuer must have been, as his face goes from excitement to petrified. Either Gideon really is just that in the know of everything. OR he was the only one on the deck aware that *Dark troopers scan for and priorities midichidlorians readings* above all else. With the the newest lightsaber wielding arrival being the biggest threat, and suppressing Grogu's own Midichidlorians presence.

Throw in the fact that Gideon is obsessed with Grogu's own blood (pumped full of Midichidlorians), I think this would make some sense."
0,"First off, I'd say that Empire *is* probably my favorite Star Wars movie (it definitely was until Rogue One came out, and then that made choosing a favorite a bit more challenging) but I saw a tier list ranking ESB as top choice, I wanted to make my own - realized most people don't really care about my list they just want to argue about theirs so I didn't.

But anyways, it got me thinking about Empire and why I usually rank it so high so I sort of played it back through my head since I had watched it someone recently and honestly, the only thing that makes me like the movie as much as I do is Hoth and the end parts of Bespin (Luke fighting Vader, and the gang escaping). Asteroid Belt, Dagobah (sorry Yoda), and the beginning parts of Bespin really don't do much for me.

Maybe it's not that unusual that certain parts of a film really make the movie shine for some people.

I'm wondering what other peoples' thoughts are on this. It doesn't bother me if ESB isn't your favorite and you still want to chime in and maybe there are other examples you can think of in Star Wars where a couple scenes make (or even break) the movie for you."
1,"I’m not sure if I can do it yet.  The show doesn’t looks remastered like TNG so it’s all fuzzy and grainy, and the cast isn’t really doing it for me either.  At first I thought it would be alright because I see O’Brien and Worf on the cast picture, but having O’Brien as a main guy on the bridge calling out tactical instructions is a bit too much.  I preferred him as a secondary in the background character like in TNG but I’m sure that’s why he made the switch to DS9 because he wanted a more starring role.  

The only new cast member I like is Dax and that’s only because she’s the hottest Star Trek girl I’ve seen so far, like classic European model hot.  Maybe even too hot because it becomes distracting.  They’ve had girls that hot on TNG but only for 1 episode like that cute little blonde Q girl.  Also they just sit there in the space station the whole time and the only exploring they do is by shuttle craft.  

I think I might try and find TNG movies, then either watch enterprise (I enjoyed the first 3 episodes of this more than the first 3 DS9 episodes), or the newer treks like discovery, short treks, and Picard.  Maybe if in a few years time they get around to remastering DS9 I’ll give it another shot."
1,What if kirk had encountered the borg?  Would they even be interested in assimilating the federation in the twenty third century?  If they were how do you think a confrontation between kirk and borg would go?  If kirk managed to defeat the borg how would his encounter with the borg change history?  Would it lead the federation to be more prepared when the dominion showed up.  Let me know what you think in the comments.

0,"Throwing these out there to get some Star Wars talk going. The questions don't necessarily  represent my opinions, they are just designed to generate discussion.

1. Is Anakin really the chosen one?
2. Was Obi-Wan wrong to lie to Luke about his father in *A New Hope*?
3. Was it a good idea for Yoda and Obi-Wan to hide Luke on Tatooine?
4. Was Han Solo's appearance in *The Rise of Skywalker* completely a product of Ben/Kylo's imagination, or did Leia and/or the force have something to do with it?
5. Did Count Dooku really want Obi-Wan to join him in *Attack of the Clones*?
6. Did having Darth Maul survive *The Phantom Menace* open up a can of worms in terms of characters ""coming back from the dead"" in Star Wars?
7. How do you feel about the introduction of a form of time travel via the World Between Worlds in *Rebels*?
8. Did Qui-Gon not do enough to secure Shmi's release in *The Phantom Menace*?
9. Did Mace Windu survive *Revenge of the Sith*?
10. Would it have been more interesting if the ""other"" Yoda spoke of in *The Empire Strikes Back* was not Leia?  What if it was Han?
11. Was Vader's move to destroy the Emperor in *Return of the Jedi* purely altruistic?
12. Why were members of the Resistance so quick to trust Finn (an ex-stormtrooper) in *The Force Awakens,* yet so quick to turn on Poe, someone they knew and trusted, in *The Last Jedi?*
13. Why did Leia essentially ""give up"" and not go out to face Kylo (as Luke did), in *The Last Jedi?*"
0,"Religion seems to play a bit of a decent role in the Star Wars franchise, with different beings believing in different things. For example, on Serenno, the homeworld of Count Dooku, seven gods were worshiped. It seems that almost everyone in the galaxy believes in the Force, and some religions like the Church of the Force venerate it. Thrawn is portrayed as a being who prefers to operate off pure, cold logic. So I wonder what he would believe in, besides the Force, as I'm sure he knows that exists."

1,"Hi. My name is Marcy. So I have been a trekkie for as long as I can remember. I come from family of people who love Trek (my parents have seen every movie in the cinema, I am massively jealous). I use to stream STO on twitch a few years ago, and run a Star Trek channel on Youtube. I also use to make Star Trek Ship paintings too. But then, I got unwell. Very unwell. Mentally.

I just wish to share this because I was just on the phone with a mental health service as I was having a very bad panic attack, and he begun asking me about Star Trek, and it was then I realized how much I actually love it. How much I miss painting star trek ships, talking about trek, just everything Star Trek. I got quite emotional. I think it is something I have shut out for a while, But I really miss doing all that. 

I just wanna thank Star Trek for existing. It means a lot that this fictional universe exists. It inspires me and can even bring me out of some very dangerous, dark moods.

Thank you Star Trek for keeping me going. And thank you for helping so many others too.

0,Can I watch clone wars after Return of the Jedi and before the newer films or should I wait till I finish all the films?
1,"Rewatching TNG and just randomly thought about this in a shot where both jeordi and worf are in the frame. Why do they both share yellow? Shouldn’t there be a distinction, like one of them is green? Is there an explanation for this or is it just the way it is?"
0,How powerful is Luke in legends?
1,"Picard S2 is understandably getting all the attention here as far as I can see. And I was under the impression the DIC trailer was a small teaser, but I finally watched it and it actually felt really extensive.

First off, I really like the new uniform. I liked the old ones too but they didn't really work on Discovery's bridge.

Then as I was thinking about how excited I was, and by the sound of things here these past few months everybody else was too, at exploring rebuilding the Federation I heard it.

&amp;#x200B;

""5 Light years across""

Oh no don't tell me-

""That's how large this gravitational anomaly is""

&amp;#x200B;

Then the rest of the trailer goes into ""crisis management mode"". Really, am I not the only one MASSIVLY disappointed at this? This premise just sounds like Burn 2.0 to me, and one crisis after another just kinda feels like you're never actually solving a problem. Take Enterprise for example, who took a season off mega-threats between the Xindi and the Earth/Romulan War. Except the Nazi 2-parter, which always felt really random, rushed, and unnecessary to me. Before even returning home from saving earth it was in danger again.

Even if this is a background that drives the plot on a bit this it feels like to soon. Do the writers need a mega-crisis to write the plot or something? I would love it if someone could sway me but I'm really curious as to what everybody else is thinking. Personally my feeling are that I have no interest in watching S3 again in S4 (though know I will watch in it anyways no matter how good/bad it is) and am actually rather excited d for Picard after seeing the interview with \*you know who\*. So a complete reversal of my anticipation for the two shows.  


At least there's Lower Decks which is a low-risk high-reward show for me. So that's nice. Still very interesting in Prodigy too and SNW gets no feelings from me until it's released and I see who wins the in battle between my love of Pike and hatred for (this) Spock."
1,Just had a thought while watching last night.  Anyone else notices the similarities in the plot?  Still love it.
0,"I know it’s probably been done to death but hear me out on this concept, it could be wild fan service that serves an emotional purpose. If that line in IV gets retconned to hold weight concerning their “rematch” where he says “When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master.”, then you have an opportunity to parallel mustafar. Instead of Obi Wan leaving Vader for dead, it’s reversed, with Vader believing himself victorious, whether out of arrogance or “insurmountable” evidence that the jedi is dead. Now, here’s another facet to this, during the battle, which would probably see Obi wan losing, he does manage to get a few hits in, one of which does the “done to death” concept. He damages Vader’s helmet. You go from JEJ to Hayden’s voice, the same hate in voice and now his eyes, and throw in a heavy tragic line at that point about how Obi wan doesn’t know what true pain and suffering is like. This could be the point that Obi wan truly starts carrying his misguided belief that Anakin is beyond redemption and that Luke is in fact the chosen one, as opposed to after the duel on mustafar, where Padme’s dying words are that there’s still good in him. Thoughts? Hate it? Like it?"

It's a shame people still disregard Disney for Star Wars' revival as the franchise is basically dead since ROTS other than a couple games and TCW."
1,"I'm here to make the case for Genetic Engineering.

Yes, a lot of fingers caressed a lot of keyboards thanks to this topic.  But I want the fear to stop, and give way to *prudent* caution.

Firstly, what is this cosa nostra, ""Star Trek""?  Yes, a trek through and in between the stars, and the adventures that ensue both onboard, and when liaising with other species.  More generally, what is it?  It's science fiction.  It's entertaining speculation about science.

SCIENCE.

And I want to put the science back into this topic.  GE is merely an extension of Biology, albeit one with enormous potential (for good, or evil, hence the ethical considerations).  Human stewardship of science has so far proceeded for the good, if you use the population count, and quality of of life of all humans on the planet as a yardstick.

The introduction of new technologies tends to have both effects - humans innately and inevitably find increasingly more efficient methods of killing each other - the bow and arrow, the bonfire, the stockade, the gun, the gas chamber, the nuke.    Humans, with equally internal and inescapable drives, also find increasingly more efficient (and creative) methods of pleasure - the bow and arrow, the bonfire, the bottle, the shooting range, the tavern, the wireless, the restaurant, the dogging site, Reddit, Netflix...

As all 3 of the following - population and quality of life AND our capacity for self-destructiveness - have grown in very slowly, if not generally unchanging proportions, I surmise that we should continue to increase our technical capabilities.

I hear you, figuratively speaking (and I ""hear"" you speaking figuratively); you fret about a quantum leap in GE whose unfolding is so sudden, so abrupt, it overtakes the capacity and competences of the authorities whose competences you already question to decelerate, confine, quarantine, or in the ghastliest, most Hitlerian of scenarios, exterminate it.  There.  I said it.

How likely is that?

We already know the initial traits of psychopathy are evident at 2; such infants engage in notably anti-social behaviour, and are either socialized out of the same a couple of years, or it fizzles out by around 27/28, with however many spells in the the clink, or worse.  There is NO 2 yr in history smart enough to intuit and mimic normal 2yr old behaviour, with the specific goal of evading modern electronic detection, to a degree capable of beating adult, covert human surveillance trained in reading microexpressions.

""Yet"", you say.

At the risk of annoying, upsetting or generally irking some of you, who I really don't want to piss off - I just want to make you THINK - GE should be advanced *conservatively*.  The entire principle of conservatism is to make improvements at a monitorable, controllable pace.  This contrasts with revolutionary - when people have just had f\*cking *enough*, for longer than enough time, of something they shouldn't have endured.   While I have every sympathy for the latter - yes, EVERY sympath - the former is the prudent caution I mentioned at the beginning that constitutes the topic, and my point, here.

If we can increase intelligence in all people by a mere 10%, however you measure the initial 100%, yes, we risk, with the MOST awful sadness, not improving the lives of hundreds of millions as much as they could have been, lest we had done so by 50% and created a Noonien who then develops a weapon that ends humanity.  Forever.

We pay a price for the speed of our advance - that's a maxim that exists EVERYWHERE in life.  I do mean everywhere.  At some point, to be decided hopefully by men smarter than myself, we forego the potential advancements we can make to the Human Genome, for conservatively lesser leaps in intelligence - or beauty - or ambidextrousness, or whatever - that fall within our capacity to monitor, and control.

Now, don't get me wrong - as a Trekker, I salute the great Rodenberry's wonderful mixture of crazed hopefulness, and caution - but I'm gonna get mundane here, walk, while you're still learning to fcking RUN.

What you want is what I hope we ALL want - a species without depression, but with compassion.  Without dyscalculia, but without excess greed for money.  With an incredible gift for creating incredible music - and incredible programming code, or incredibly inspiring memes.

And without the fckh-headism that invaded Poland, or dragged people from Africa in chains, or thinks it's cool that 67% of people work at just over minimum wage and live lives of quiet desperation.

Julian Bashir cursed his parents for rescuing him from a life of the most grinding mediocrity - I think we fans, producers, and humans in general need to wise up, and take us up the wonderful mountain.

We are, all of us, TREKKERS - do we not owe it to ourselves to explore this new frontier?   And if no man has gone there before, let me just say now:

LET ME BE THE FIRST."
1,"I remember seeing this episode years ago but I can't quite remember what series.  All of my googling keeps returning the wrong episodes.

It centres around mostly one main character. I believe Riker, if not Paris.  They find themselves recruited in a war on a planet.  It felt a bit Nam-esque.  They come across their fallen comrades and they are tied face up so that their spirits cannot return to the planet.  I won't reveal the end of course.  I'm certain its Riker but it would make more sense in Voyager .

My gf has decided she like star trek now, 1 year into lockdown.  We've made it to the TNG DS9 transition.  I want to know if I get to watch it soon as tng wraps up or do I have to wait until part way through voyager."

0,"There's this huge, sweeping set of lore that the (now-)Legends stuff created, which has been partly adopted, partly dropped, partly revamped in the Disney canon. There's so much to keep track of, and I wonder if Disney hires people specifically to record all the lore and make sure all references and additions in new media remain internally consistent. Like archivists or historians of the SW universe.

Is this a job? Or is it just up to people working on specific movies/shows/books/etc. to keep tracking of everything and make sure it all adds up?"
0,Who would want to see that? It should be interesting if ever made.
0,"Currently re-re-re-re-rewatching clone wars, and I'm at where Yoda has to train to preserve his life force to be able to manifest after death. And one thing I've always wondered was what test Qui Gon failed. 

Because watching, you see that Yoda isn't given the chance to leave and come back, this we can deduce that his death was not the reason he didn't complete it. But rather, failed a test and thus, wasn't taught to preserve his life force. But he was taught enough to be able to speak from the grave.

So I come asking.  What test did Qui Gon fail?"
1,"Watching Picard become overwhelmed by 200 years of repressed Vulcan emotion was a masterclass in acting. It’s just a single close up shot of his face, and the transitions between rage, sadness, confusion and anguish were as powerful as they were mesmerizing. I can’t imagine what Stewart’s preparation was like and what the mood on the set was that day.

My gf had never seen the episode and was literally in shock after the scene. Hiring a Shakespearean stage actor paid off big and its these moments that need to be more prevalent in the Trek universe moving forward."
1,"Let’s talk Vulcans. There are quite a few over the course of many shows, and most add a lot to their shows. So let‘s talk Vulcans. 

I have a very hard time picking a favourite. Spock is a very obvious front runner, but Tuvok is hilarious as well. His interactions with Neelix and Tom are fantastic. Then there’s T‘Pol, who has fantastic development and is invaluable to her crew. I honestly struggle to pick one.

What about you? Got any favourites here?"
0,"As an 80s kid, I found out about Luke, Leia, and Vader progressively through the OT (then saw the prequels later). But we’ve now had a generation of people who started with TPM and knew about the Skywalkers even before Carrie Fisher appears onscreen!

What was that experience like for you? Did it weird you out when Luke and Leia kiss? Do you like it this way, having that perspective before you meet everyone as adults? Or do you wish you learned it at the end of ROTJ?"
0,"In TPM and AOTC the Jedi make it sound like it was a long time since a Sith had made themselves known. So who, canonically and officially, is the last Sith that made a play?

We all know there have been Sith in pairs for many centuries, but I was hoping there was something more definitive that I hadn't heard of."
0,"I am in a very heated discussion as to whether or not the Anakin version of Darth Vader or the suit version was more powerful. I am on the side of Anakin being the most powerful Jedi of all time, but having to depend on his suit limited his power. My friend thinks the suited version was more powerful. 

Is there anything from comics or lore that proves either of our points?"
1,"As edington said most people don't want to be admirals they want to be captains.  So wouldn't some people be wiling to do whatever it took to get the captain's chair.  Something like your superior officer was supposed to do something but you go behind them and screw it up so they get the blame.  Or maybe your superior is supposed to be somewhere for an important briefing but you put an anesthetic in their drink so they are out of it for a few hours.

Or maybe you finally made it to first officer and you want command of the ship.  So you reprogram the captian's replicator to put alcohol in their food and drink.  So that they are wasted during a crisis.  Not to worry though because your capable and have the situation under control.  I'm not saying any of these things are good or acceptable behavior.  They aren't.  I'm just surprised they aren't more common.  So considering that most people want the captain's chair I'm surprised that a lot more people don't resort to covert and even overt mutiny to get it.

Starfleet had been around for a century before they had their first overt mutineer.  And picard was shocked that there was a mutiny on the pegasus.  I guess those would be overt forms of mutiny.  But I would say covert mutiny is a lot more common."
0,"I just finished watching the Last Jedi for the first time and surprisingly I really enjoyed it, characters, and yes even Luke I really liked. Different from his take on Legends but still thoroughly enjoyed it. (not like I read the legends novels so far but from what I heard and read, planning to read the Thrawn trilogy already own the first book) I saw force awakens by chance one time and went to see the rise of skywalker during Christmas because I just wanted to go to the movies. But even though I never saw LJ I still heard stuff about it so that gave me an opinion of it without even watching it. Anyway, im sidetracking. I recently got interested in the novelizations of the movies(as the covers saying expanded or bonus material really got me interested)just today (4/7) I found the Force Awakens one at goodwill and bought it. And from what I heard the Last Jedi improves the movie even for people who didn't even like it, so does that mean I will enjoy the book more than the people who didn't like the movie? Same for The Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker? P.S. I haven't seen ROF since it came out but I feel I will enjoy it less now that I've seen Last Jedi and really enjoyed it.."

So, I have a proposal:

-Pick one character

-Place all of their in-between stories in chronological order.

-Determine how many days each story takes place.

-Use knowledge of hyperdrive speeds and hyper lanes to determine transit time as well

-Take into account any references to other days mentioned in each story (I.E. ""I was on Tatooine a week ago"")

-Determine how many days off the character had.

Do you think such a task would be possible?"
0,Seems like there's no reason for 3PO to follow Anakin when he's technically owned by Lars. I've only watched Ep1 &amp; 2 so far (Currently in The Clone Wars season 1) so I imagine this is how 3PO got involved with the Republic in the first place... by just following Anakin? Is it a plot hole? Was there no better way to explain how 3PO joined the republic? Also who finished him? In episode 1 he asked Anakin to finish him before he left with Liam Neesan but in EP 2 he's already all Gold.

Discovery &amp; Picard were both a huge nope for me, lots of anger and explosions.  And the recent movies, while fun, don't really capture the spirit of the older shows.

Based on what I've read, they seem to be ""saying"" the right things at least about Strange New Worlds being an optimistic show about exploration.  Does anyone think that's actually going to happen?"

“Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms.

This episode is so timeless and so relevant. I feel sad there is no clear answer..."
0,"If the Jedi are to rise again, or a new Force Order replaces them, it's essential that Rey not repeat Luke's mistakes. I only see one option. She looks for other Force-sensitive individuals who have also been self-training and testing their abilities. And they start the long process of forming a new order. Learning and practicing with each other, and even if they take on apprentices it'll still be a work in progress. It's essential that they start small and work their way towards something bigger. And like Darth Bane's former Order of the Sith Lords, the founding members need to come to terms with the fact that when they become one with the Force, their work will be nowhere near finished and their successors will have to continue it."

1,"Between Pon Farr, age related illnesses and neurological disorders, we’ve seen Vulcans act like raging lunatics. In some cases homicidal. 

From what we know, Vulcans chose self control and logic because their savagery almost caused their extinction. If so, why are they always boasting superiority?

It’s like a heroin addict boasting self control when he’s one bad day away from falling apart.  
Humans are emotional but aren’t in danger of killing everyone if they lose their tempers."

But how do they eat? They don't appear to have teeth, or a jaw.      
How do they talk? They can speak basic perfectly, but they don't have a tongue or lips?

This comic was from Legends, so it's technically not canon anymore, the Disney Kel Dor mouth would probably look quite a bit different."

The whole space station is in lockdown because of some deadly virus. 
 

Quark is arguing that his bar is an essential service...

It all seems too real."
1,"They get into situations that could easily be avoided and then they wonder why people get killed.  They don't send probes to scout ahead of the ship to look for hazards.  That would save them so much trouble.  They don't use drones or robots when beaming down to a hazardous location or onto a ship with hostile aliens.  When they encounter a crazy space anomaly they fly really close to it.  Instead of just sending a probe.  When they are told a region of space is super dangerous and that they should leave immediately they stay and investigate it.  This is what led to them running into the borg.  

And their biggest problem is they are extremely arrogant and don't seem to learn from their mistakes.  They try to impose their values on almost every other civilization they encounter.  Despite the prime directive.  Which would be fine if the prime directive didn't exist.  But it just makes them look like hypocrites.  They also use the prime directive as a shield to avoid getting their hands dirty when they don't want to help others.  Like when they turned their backs on the planet of drug addicts.  So as an organization they are arrogant with an ego the size of the sun and stupid.  

And the rigid military structure of starfleet makes it so they repeat the same mistakes and are slow to accept new ideas and new far less hazardous ways of doing things.  So they are extremely arrogant and because of it act like idiots.  And put themselves in unnecessary danger.  They try to maximize the risks of space travel.  Why else would they run so much power through consoles.  They could accomplish a lot by sending robots and holograms into dangerous situations (And by using them to maintain their ships).  But they send people instead.  These are supposed to be highly educated people but they make extremely stupid decisions on a regular basis.  And a lot of people end up getting killed because of it.  

And that's during times of peace.  When they're at war their incompetence and stupidity goes to insane levels.  Just look at the dominion war.  So starfleet as an organization is extremely egotistical and arrogant.  And hypocritical because they pick when they want to follow the prime directive and when they don't.  And they aren't consistent about it.  I think if they are going to have the prime directive their should be exceptions to it for things like planetary disasters.  But they violate the prime directive when they want to and use it as a shield when they don't want to get involved.  But they also talk about it like it's gospel.  So they are arrogant, incompetent, inconsistent, and stupid.  And considering the rigid military nature of the organization they aren't likely to get much smarter."
1,"This has been bugging me for a while. Which synthetic beings (holograms, androids, etc.) count as fully sentient, intelligent, life?

Some are obviously Sentient, like Data; that was proven in Measure of a Man. I will use the criteria from that episode to judge everything else (Are they intelligent, self-aware and conscious). Androids like Soji are obviously sentient as well.

What about holograms like the EMH and Vic Fontaine? What about the evil hologram Seska who steals the doctor's mobile emitter and tries to take over Voyager? All three of them are intelligent, drawing from large computers, self-aware, as they all acknowledge they are holograms and try to better themselves, and I would argue conscious as well, at least in the cases of Fontaine and the Doc (they both understand what it is like to be turned off and on again. The EMH dreads being turned off and Fontaine asked Bashir to let him sing a little longer when he left, as he enjoyed it. Let me re-iterate: a Holosuite character wants to sing a little longer after everyone left the Holosuite because he likes it. He has emotions and hobbies.

What about other holodeck characters; when you kill them, are you committing murder? Are the characters from Our Man Bashir sentient? What do you guys think?

I don't really know, I just thought I'd see what you guys think."

That is so absurd.  Nu-Trek ""apologists"" are just sick and tired of hearing the same thing over and over again.  

You want to hate the new shows? Fine.  BUt you don't need to shove it down people's throats, every damn day. On YouTube, Reddit, EVEN INSTAGRAM.

People need to realize Discovery is here to stay.  EVerytime there is a post, I mean come on. NO ONE can talk about NuTrek in here, and it's getting annoying.

I can almost gurantee that most newer fans have been pushed away because of the attitude in this sub. It would make ANYONE angry.  Which I am.  I take a break from here, come back and it's the same shit over and over again.

I don't always want to talk about TNG/VOY/DS9 every day.

I mean this isn't fair anymore.

1,"Hello,  


I was wondering how the economy of Star Trek works. It always looks like there is no money, everyone can eat for free from replicators but everyone still works.

And so you end up with the small cabin and then you do what to make your life better? Only going up the ranks for a bigger cabin? Status seems to be some kind of currency as well and Picard always can somehow bring out some latinum in case a trade is needed. But in total it looks like socialism there.

Also there are colonists there. They work hard for a measly life. What are they working for? Fruits that one could just replicate with some cheap energy? And why doing it at all?

If it's socialism I wonder how the economy can stay in motion since we know from countless experiments that socialism doesn't work because of the missing price discovery and the uneven spread of power.

Given that the series is an interesting view into the future I would like to know how they solved the money thing.

Thank you!"

1,"&gt;!The ""beard"" in this case is the captain's chair. For too long, Discovery has been fighting an internal battle between being a show about Burnham, or being a show about its titular vessel. With Burnham stepping up to command, that conflict is potentially resolved. Most of the legitimate criticisms of Discovery stem from said conflict. Now the writers have the opportunity to make a show that is both about Burnham and about the ship without having to go to ridiculous lengths to justify one or the other. I'm really looking forward to seeing if the ""beard,"" or the ""braid,"" as some have deemed it, has been earned. Here's hoping that in true Star Trek fashion, season 4 will no longer be about finding the show's place in the universe, but instead about absolutely excelling in the place it finds itself!&lt;"
1,"So I have been thinking about it on my rewatch and it really hit in DS9 Trails and Trib-ulations with the lines 
""Which Enterprise?""
""The first one""
Does ENT suffer from the fact, that despite the FIRST Enterprise under Archer being maybe the single most pivotal ship in Starfleet and Federation history, no one talks about it?
See Disco did good making their history altering ship disappear. ENT has this history altering ship and uh, no one ever talks about it again? I mean, I know why, but it doesn't make me think about it any less."
1,"Acted main cast character ever in ST? Basically I'm watching ENT full for first time on Netflix and he just takes me out of it everytime he's in a scene. He feels like someone that just wandered in from the street to ask for directions and the hired him on that basis. Like he's able to give any line the same emotional resonance as I would if asking directions from a stranger to a restaurant in an unfamiliar part of town. Anyway I was wondering if other peeps agreed or do folks think there's an even bigger turd in the ST bowel and if so, who and why? Only thinking main cast members btw, no awful one shots or cringy recurring roles."
1,"I'm relatively new to Star Trek. So far I've only watched VOY and TNG, but I'm loving it so far. I'm currently in the process of finishing DS9 ( second season ) , yet unlike the previous shows I can't seem to like or trust the captain Sisko. 

I think one of the main reasons I find it hard to trust or like him, is his approachability. Compared to the previous captains, he almost seems unapproachable, particularly when he lets his anger get the best of him .Futhermore we don't really see him form any friendships with any of the other crew members yet .So far, most of his relationships have been strictly business, save for Dax and his son.  


Secondly, maybe this is just my impression but I don't feel his motivations the way I did with the previous captains. Atleast with them, I could genuinely feel how much they cared about their ship and their crew members, but with Sisko, it doesn't really feel like he cares , or atleast he doesn't show it.

&amp;#x200B;

  
In the previous shows I watched, I got to see Tuvok's and Janeways relationship and her relationship with Chakotay. In TNG , we got to see Picard's almost mentor-like relationship with Riker and Data, and his relationship with Beverely.    


Hopefully DS9's characters get better as I continue to watch because as of right now, I don't particularly like any of them."

1,"Picard and Vash didn't always get along that well, but I got to thinking lately it might have been fun if they had some more adventures together.  Perhaps in Picard's retirement he spends more time with his archaeology hobby, and finds himself competing with Vash for a dig or an artifact.   Or maybe they team up?  Would Vash help get Picard into a dig he couldn't get to on his own?  ..

Just trying to understand the other side.

For me it’s so out of character it would pretty much be the equivalent of the new Batman’s character, infamous for not killing anyone, suddenly killing Robin.

I know this isn’t a perfect example because there are some earlier iterations of Batman where he killed people, but just pick any protagonist, and them suddenly acting against their core trait, making them a completely different character.

Even if it was done to subvert expectations, and he ended up being the character we always knew he was (I don’t see it that way), what was the point?"

As a lifelong fan of both *Star Trek* and *Beavis and Butthead*,  I think it's a great commercial as strict entertainment. I thought it was the best Super Bowl commercial by far. It's creative, funny, and memorable like few advertisements I've ever seen. 

With that said, *Star Trek* used to be respected on another level. It makes me sad it's no longer on that level. The show used to stand as a beacon of light in terms of what we could hope television could ever be at its best. It stood for truth, justice, righteousness, and edgy creativity like no other TV show has. 

All of that has been put on an equal footing with *Beavis and Butthead*.  Someone please notify the YouTuber Overlord DVD about this, so he can make a video about it."
1,"A bit of background. My son (7) and I have been watching all of the Star Trek movies in order, and we just finished *Generations* this past weekend. Since *First Contact* is next, I'm wondering if I should have him watch all or some of the Borg TNG episodes as background.

He hasn't watched many episodes of Trek (mainly DS9), and when we were watching *Generations* he had questions like, ""why is he so pale (Data)"" or ""Is he blind? (LaForge).

So, all that being said -- how important do you all think it would be for him to get some Borg episodes under his belt before we go to *First Contact*?

*Q Who?* is their introduction, and *BOBW* is really the ""prequel"", in a way, of *First Contact*. I'm not sure if the ones after would be worth it, like *I, Borg* or *Descent*.

Thoughts?"

My suggestion.

Episode Part 1 opens.

We see Janeway walking through a corridor, she looks different, wait, her hairs in a bun. She enters an unfamiliar office and says, ""*Commander""*.  The adresse looks up, its 2271 era Benjamin Sisko,  complete with hair, clean-shaven, and only three pips. Opening credits roll.

We arrive at the present day in the Captain's ready room. Chakotay and Janeway are having one of theirs totally platonic, not romantic, no siree, dinners. Chakotay is talking about the Starfleet official history and analysis of the Dominion War battles of DS9, which came in with the last transmission burst. He says he is impressed by Benjamin Sisko's leadership, especially the mining of the wormhole. Janeway, mentions that she actually met Sisko before the fateful sortie into the badlands. 

We have a flashback to that, which continues sometime after Janeway had entered the office in the stinger. Sisko is sharing DS9 's badland navigation data and intelligence reports about Chakotay's cell, and his own assessment of the man. Janeway asks if he knows him, Sisko says no, but they overlapped at the Academy and everyone knew who Chakotay was due to his boxing prowess. Janeway then expresses some sympathy for the Marquis, which seems to annoy Sisko. Janeway, noticing this, gives thanks to him for his help. She says that this combined with Tom Paris's knowledge of the cell should be invaluable in completing their mission. Sisko then says he knows the former CO of Caldik Prime and he thinks Tom's punishment was excessively harsh, to Janeway's enthusiastic concurrence. Kira enters and advises Janeway that Voyager is ready to depart. She hands her a PADD, and tells her those are the unique Comm codes, which Voyager will use to contact DS9 on a secure channel. 

Back to the present day, the episode continues as in the original real-world one.  The Doctor diagnosis Tuvok's illness and has to report it to the shocked Janeway. Paris and Ba'lanna's baby is overdue and Seven is talking to Neelix, whose replacement as Mess chef Chakotay and Janeway are discussing when Harry calls them.  Sensors have discovered the Transwarp conduit as they did in the original episode., but the difference is that it's unguarded and small. Janeway, after a lengthy meet, decides to go to investigate, though Chakotay worries about the Borg.As Voyager approaches it and sends a probe through, the scene changes, and the Borg queen is seen viewing Voyager. She instructs ""*keep observing it out of range of sensors and don't assimilate, for now.*

We see a PADD carrying ensign walking, wait, why is she wearing Alpha Quadrant unforms, oh this is DS9 in the present day. She enters Sisko's old office, only instead of Sisko there is another Starfleet officer n command......well damn, it is Kira, in a Commander's uniform....Bajor did end up in the Federation after all. The Ensign says comms has been getting hails on a secure channel, but its an old code...Kira looks at it and exclaims that its the one she herself gave Voyager, seven years ago. She asks the origin of the hail and is told that it's from the other end of the wormhole.......Voyager is now in the Gamma Quadrant.

&amp;#x200B;

Fade to black, end of part 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2, well I am struggling. Obviously, Voyager arriving in the Gamma Quadrant, near enough that she can contact DS9 is a game changer, but I must admit, I am finding writing beyond this point difficult."

1,"So I was watching TOS episode ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" this evening on cable. I noticed that in an early scene where Kirk and Spock run into a cop after stealing clothes they edited out some dialog. The possibility occurred to me that the lines might have been edited for being deemed offensive by current standards. The lines I'm referring to involve Kirk suggesting to the cop that Spock is Chinese and that his ears took on their unusual shape after getting caught in a mechanical rice picker, and that he was tended to by an American missionary who was also a plastic surgeon. If I'm correct in my supposition it makes me curious if there might be any other lines from the series that have been cut from cable broadcast for similar reasons. Anyone out there aware of other examples?"

Hello Star Wars Fans I come to you in need of help.

I am looking for a moment in a Sci-Fi series or movie or audiobook where there is an emphasis on a new incoming transmission. I am aware this happens countless times through many series (Star Trek, Stargate SG-1) but I am **not** talking about a casual 5 second audio of ""New Message received"".

I mean a moment something like this: ""*Captain, we have picked up an unidentified radio signal*""

*""Origin unknown, possibly Alien""*

*""Patch it through"" ""What is it? Run scans""* etc etc.

My idea is to have this small 20 second clip as an intro for a music mix I am working on which is space themed. If anyone has any other ideas for how I can transition to music let me know.

I have been on QuoDb going through various Alien invasion or space movies and TV shows but none of them hit the spot and I have spent hours crawling through 50s and 60s sci-fi films to no avail.

The best I have is the first 25 seconds of this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJrw6imp7f8&amp;t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJrw6imp7f8&amp;t=20s)"
0,"The more times I watch The Phantom Menace the more I realize I don't understand the backstory that sets up the movie. Why did Gunray team with Sidious in the first place? Why is a blockade legal? And why set up a blockade in the first place? I get Lord Sidious' reasoning behind it because he wants to somehow put Chancellor Valorum on the spotlight and show how he can't control something as simple as a blockade, but why would Gunray side with him. What tactical advantage does it give the Trade Federation?"
1,"WOW! What an episode. I'm no expert, but this episode may be the best I've seen so far. Finally having a sort of redemption for Tasha (her death was so random and meaningless) gave me multiple chills. The writing was impeccable and captivating and has left me giddy like a 10 year-old. 
And can I just say how epic Guinan is? I admire her more in every episode she's in. I'd love to see more of her, I'm sure her experience could be useful to Picard in many situations. 
Sorry, this has probably been posted multiple times, but I couldn't contain my excitement and I needed somewhere to share it."

Not counting the gas clouds or energy anomalies etc, which races really stand out as being stronger or more advanced than the others?

Is anyone particularly ahead of the rest, or would there be sort of a 'top 5' or so relatively comparable?"
1,"I really enjoyed this episode.  I thought it was going to be Dukat's arraignment and Sisko being kind to Dukat. 

Plenty of twists in the episode.

I started off thinking Sisko and Dukat are going to chat around the fire and rescue beacon until a ship shows up, with the roles reversed and some redemption for Dukat, but then twist! 

Dukat's been saved by the Dominion already and they're just toying with Sisko, but then twist!

Dukat's seeing people.  Ziyal's death really has hit him hard. Maybe he will off Sisko because he's not well in the head. 

Turns out, the rescue beacon wasn't transmitting after all, Sisko fixes it. The Defiant picks up two life forms on a planer, but twist!  It's not Sisko and Dukat.  

The editing in this episode was *chef's kiss* by the way.

Dukat gets his ""trial"" with ""Judge"" Sisko and to see Dukat's pretzel logic on display was amazing. (amazing performance) Since Sisko realizes Dukat's hallucinating, he takes his shot during Dukat's monlouge to attempt an escape. 

Why he didn't lift the phaser off Dukat and fully stun him is the only head scratching thing to me, but the plot required it.  Sisko was in a hurry in his injured state to leave I guess. 

Sisko's vow to defend Bajor and ""I fear no evil"" left me with goosebumps. 

This episode continues the tradition of awesome captains being Cardassian prisoners, though there weren't any lights involved this time around and Sisko is functionally a prisoner."

1," So I need help remembering a Star Trek episode (I think it was TNG--though it might not even have been a Star Trek episode).  It involved this red/brown-ish blob monster and I think Geordi was involved with the episode.

1,"I have just finished the first 6 episodes in Season 1 of TNG and am very disappointed. I like most of the cast, though Ryker is a bit boring. However, the addition of a psychic and a  precocious teenager to the cast  just doesn't work for me. Also, whereas the original Star Trek episodes always seemed to end with a bit of humor, this one tends to gets schmaltzy. 

That said, I have been told it gets better in Season 2 so and I am determined to watch all episodes of all 7 seasons. Thoughts?"

0,"I'm sure many of you are excited about Hera making the jump to live action as well, but I keep seeing articles claiming that her live action version would be replacing Cara Dune in Ranger of the new republic. This has me confused because I have yet to see anything that confirmed, or was even more than just a speculative rumor, that Cara Dune would be in rangers. The speculation of a Cara Dune spinoff was just that, speculation with no confirmation. So unless I'm missing something here, where was it ever said that Cara Dune was officially getting her own show, or was going to be in Rangers?

As for Hera being part of Rangers, I'm curious as to how that would work out if true. Personally I feel we'd be missing out if Hera didn't join the search for Ezra after the battle of Jakku. I also feel this would be fitting for her character, as Ezra and Her both shared a level connection to Kanan that the rest of the Ghost crew did not, and I can't see Hera not trying to find Ezra after helping free the galaxy from the empire. Curious as to how others would perceive this."
0,"Because Padmé supposedly wasn't choked ""all the way"", so to speak, and resumed breathing at some point. But what about when someone is on the floor before the choker lets go? Are they already dead? I know we see this is clearly the case with Captain Needa, but you don't really see Kendall Ozzel below the monitor's view. I mean sure, Vader would have ensured it was fatal in that case. But what about it exactly would cause an immediate death? Because everyone that's been killed by it hadn't explicitly died until they were on the floor, whereas if their windpipe was straight-up crushed, wouldn't they die still in the air/on their feet? They seem to continue struggling against the grip right up until they're on the floor. Ozzel was even able to keep his hand on his collar right up until he left the view.

Of course, I'm not saying anyone would have gone to revive Ozzel, given that if Vader is the one executing him, then it goes. But say for cases like Letta Turmond. Offee couldn't be strong enough to make the choke immediately-fatal, right? Surely it's just that the concept of pumping air into someone to resume their breathing hasn't been invented???"

1,"Hello fellow Star Trek fans. 
This is a very random question in regards to Tribbles. 

Tribbles have featured throughout many episodes, series and movies. 

However does anyone remember or know if any Tribble has ever been given a name, considering they were initially brought to the ships / star bases as pets. 

The only reason I am asking this, is I recently adopted two guinea pigs, one long hair and one short hair. It would be awesome if we could come up with a couple names from Tribbles from Star Trek. 

Years ago I had one hairy brown guinea pig and literally called her Tribble so sadly I can’t reuse that name. 

Although I fear this quest may go unresolved due to lack of named Tribbles in Star Trek. 

I hope to hear some suggestions or see if any ST Tribbles actually had names. 

Thanks in advance!"

He has to figure out himself how to put things to rights. I think he has to blow up the core of the Enterprise in conjunction with another event to resolve the anomaly.

What I do remember is Geordi putting in the calculations into the computer in Engineering and as he succeeds, he screams “Yes!” as the screen fades to white - seemingly as the ship in one timeline is exploding. The episode then recovers to another day at the Enterprise in the other timeline, and no one else is aware of the impending doom Geordi saved everyone from.  

I am wracking my brain and cannot, for the life of me, remember what episode this is. I could be mistaken about the details. Any help?"

1,"For me the newer Trek is a mixed bag. I like all the bits that remind me of what I love about it, and I also like that the stakes feel higher with the more serious approach. 

I do not like the dystopian perspective they espouse as opposed to the more utopian one that was presented in the older shows. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with loving both the old and new shows which I think everyone agrees on; but it's been bothering that some fans who like the new shows a lot act as though ""Trek has always been this way"" or ""it feels like Trek to me"", when they discuss it comparatively with the older shows. 

There is an objective difference in the tonal and thematic presentation of the newer shows vs the older ones. 

I'm all for a positive reception of the newer shows but it would be nice if that could be something everyone would admit, as opposed to ignoring all the drastic differences in style between them so that others will be more inclined to watch the newer shows. 

The newer shows are like sopranos or breaking bad with star trek characters- it is a drastically different vibe from the light hearted episodic formula of the older shows. People going into the new shows should be informed of this, so they aren't immediately turned off by the sheer degree of difference in style."

0,"We all know the meme. We all love it. But I just found myself wondering what Palpy's story actually meant.

So Darth Plagueis could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to keep the ones he cared about from dying, right? But isn't the whole point about being a Sith that you're fully egostical and only care about yourself? So why would Plagueis even care about keeping anyone except himself from dying in the first place? Or is this part of the story just something Palpy made up to seduce Anakin to the dark side?

I'm sure there's some Legends explanation out there, I'm just too uncivilized to know the answer."

Also, I know that once you leave the order the Council will see you as a future threat, so there is no way they will be treated fondly by Jedi Generals unless they are old friends.

I see a few pros and cons to this.

Pros: No longer under the strict and heavily enforced Jedi rules, ability to raise a family, general freedom, no longer obliged to become a *de facto* general and able to have hobbies.

Cons: A lot of both Jedi and Republic monitoring, scrutiny from fellow Jedi and government officials, plenty of soldiers eyeing them in suspicion, PMCs constantly trying to recruit them and constant annoying Jedi haters."

so my thought is that when obi wan took anakin's/vader's lightsaber with him it's like he took the last remnant of what remained of anakin. So when he gave it to luke I'd like to think that luke literally had his father with him and protecting him throughout his journey up to his battle with vader. So vader has a new lightsaber that is almost identical to the flex but darker, I'd think its a symbolic battle between vader and anakin from their lightsabers clashing which ended with anakin losing to vader/the dark side again when vader cut lukes hand off and the flex plummeted. 

When i said again i was more referencing the story arc where vader set off to build a new lightsaber and bleed a kyber crystal. when vader was bleeding the crystal, anakin was back but not so long as it happened vader gained back control, repressed anakin and bled the crystal red"
1,"I should probably qualify with “pre-Discovery”. Most TNG deaths at the very least and probably in DS9 and Voyager to a degree but TNG is probably the heaviest culprit (I’m early in season 5 of a complete watch through of all the live action Star Trek series). The OG Trill Odan’s host and the helm officer pre credits in “Disaster” are the most egregious recent examples.

The episode is off to a bad start when Brahms questions him about his engine modifications in a professional manner, Geordi is being confrontational and defense from the start. He then lies to her repeatedly throughout the episode and manipulates her with the information he has about her. 

What's the first thing the writers have her reveal about herself? That she's too frigid and obsessed with her work. She is literally just trying to do her job while she puts up with Geordi's crap, no man would have had to justify himself.

And what the absolute f was their confrontation on the Holodeck. She has every right to feel upset and violated cause it's exactly how it looked; that program was a romantic fantasy, *they kissed*. How does Geordi respond? He gets angry and turns on her! 

&gt; You've been bugging me since you got here! I've shown you courtesy, and respect, and a hell of a lot of patience! I'm guilty alright! Guilty of reaching out to you, of offering you friendship! 

BULLSHIT. He had the hots for her every step of the way, he hit on her all the time, he tried to lure her on a date, he was disappointed when he learned she is married. Nothing about that was ""reaching out in friendship"". Yet he storms off, depicted as being in the right, after that SHE apologizes to HIM as they toast to their new friendship.

1,"I may be wrong but I thought the romulans powered their ships via a captured singularity. Now, I’m not sure if they still used dilithium for warp but I know they didn’t use a traditional warp core and I feel like TNG made a fairly big deal about having difficulty tracking them due to the lack of a normal warp signature in a couple of episodes. I could be wrong but, if I’m not, it just seems odd that that wouldn’t have become the default method of FTL in trek after the burn. Especially when we are led to believe that the romulans joined the federation at some point after the supernova. But even if they didn’t, you want to believe that with all of the Federation’s espionage, they wouldn’t have a rudimentary idea at the very least of how a singularity drive is created?"

Ok, with that out of the way, I have a question. We all know Darth Sidious = Supreme Chancellor, but did Count Dooku and all the other Sith people know that the Chancellor was the Sith Lord? I think Maul kinda made it clear that he didn’t, but I never really got a straight answer with Dooku or anyone else. I mean, if Maul got trained by Palpatine, he would’ve had to seen his face and be able to recognize him. Not sure if everyone just never made the connection or if it was actually part of the plan..."

I've never seen Enterprise, which I've heard mixed things about. But it's also on Netflix and I'm wondering if it's binge-watchable? Or should I watch TOS next (which I've also never seen, being a 90's kid who's really into that era)? I generally love most sci fi from the 90s and early 2000s."
1,"Unless I have miscounted, we're currently at seven live-action iterations of *Star Trek*. Given the wealth of characters, I thought it would be fun to get a poll of everyone's favourites. The idea would be to put together the ultimate [Starfleet](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/47/50/7f/47507fedc0adfdd6c723c375defd28cf.png) crew, irrespective of space and time.

0,"So I got through to the World Between Worlds Arc and for what its worth it was really great. But I just felt that that was sorta the perfect ending for anything I cared about and as soon as I started watching the 3rd episode I just kinda noped out of there.

I guess I just don't really care about what happens to Lothal.

So is there any reason for me to watch those last two episodes or can I just call it a day?"
1,"I was looking through the Bridge Officers aboard Starships and I noticed that some ships have a Pilot and a Navigator and some have a single Conn Officer

How is it decided if a ship has both positions or just a Conn Officer? Is it based on ship age, size, or another factor?"
0,"Pre ordered this on Audible, can't wait for it to come out.  Meanwhile I'm finishing the third in Zahn's other Thrawn Trilogy - Thrawn: Treason.

0,"I grew up loving Luke. But was always left wanting more. But with all the new shows being greenlit, I feel there would be huge demand for 2 Luke based shows, both which could use Mark Hamill. First an animated show after ROTJ where Luke (voiced by Hamill) goes on his adventures before he becomes disillusioned. 

And secondly, a live action show starring Mark Hamill as Luke in the great beyond of the Force, dwelling on the great mysteries of the force. Possibly allowing for cameos from any Jedi. 

What are your thoughts?"
1,"A showrunner is the director of the show, the guy in charge. Terry Matalas was not involved in Picard S1 so there's already that going for it.

Terry Matalas is the guy who created the 12 Monkeys TV show for SyFy for a very successful 4 seasons, one of the only shows on SyFy to have not been cancelled in recent history.

12 Monkeys, if you have not seen it, is regarded as one of the best time travel show on television, and not for no reason. It's literally amazing, I highly recommend it. It's very underrated and didn't get much attention due it being on SyFy and also based on a movie everybody liked.

But seriously, it turned into its own thing and ditched the story of the movie really quick.

If you've seen 12 Monkeys, then you probably know that Picard S2 is in very good hands, and we can pretty much forget the shitshow that was S1 because I'm definitely expecting some great and exciting Trek.

Let's not look to S2 with disappointment because of S1's failures, I don't imagine it'll be perfect, but I do imagine it'll be at least good. Fingers are crossed!

Happy First Contact Day!"
1,"Greetings everyone, 

I haven’t posted a topic yet but I feel some might find this interesting.

I wanted to let everyone know that we at Developer Dialogue released a new episode where we have on the show Wella Lasola &amp; Bill Chinn, the developers behind the 1999 Star Trek game, Birth Of The Federation.  We spend the episode diving back to the development days of this legendary game that stood the test of time, and discovery some interesting design decisions.  We also discuss the challenges the team faced developing a Star Trek 4X Strategy game with only The Next Generation license.  We round up the interview discussing the possibility of a sequel and getting the old team back together again.  

If you guys are interested you can listen to it here:

1,"Imagine, if you will. 

You wake up one morning and find yourself on the bridge of the Enterprise-D. The computer informs you that you are now the captain and all command codes have been transferred to you. 

You are the only person aboard. Through the view screen you can clearly see Earth below. 

The computer further informs you that:
-The ship was unexpectedly transported to the year 2021 without the crew. 

-The ship had just left Space Dock after a through maintenance visit. All systems are fully operational, the stores are fully stocked including the shuttle bay. (Though you suspect the ship will eventually need skilled maintenance.)

-Earth is within transporter range and the ship has not yet been detected by anyone on Earth. 

-No one on Earth knows you are on board. 

So...what do you do?

TL;DR.  What would you do if you had the Enterprise, today, at your disposal?"
0,"I know the internet obviously isn't the majority but man it seems like it launched without much fanfare. And if you look at any of the videos posted on youtube about the era/characters (Like todays was about Marchion Ro) they're all massively downvoted with all the comments being hateful and trashing the series. Even on this sub while there has been discussion I haven't see recurring discussion.   


Keep in mind I am not saying everyone has to love the series, I am also aware that because it's only books/comics at the moment that it has a smaller audience, but it's really sad to see and I feel bad for team who has spent the past year working on it. Personally this ERA of SW has actually started off so damn strong for me it's quickly becoming potentially my top/top 2 era of SW.   


I would be interested to know how much more popular it might've been if it was a series/movie instead of comics/novels. I know we have the acolyte coming but it's set near the end of the High Republic."

1,"My father-in-law is having a Star Trek themed 60th birthday party. Due to COVID-19 we are having it outside at a campground. I would like to purchase several “uniform” styled hoodies, similar to what ThinkGeek had a decade ago or so. There are several options on Amazon, but with so much coming from China and having fake reviews, I am nervous. I was wondering if anyone has had a good experience with a company. 

I am sorry if this type of question is not allowed. Just let me know and I’ll take it down."
1,"Spotty gave the past aluminum glass. Though we have made it today, so umm a 15 or so advance on tech ant that bad. But Voyager saw the computer boom of the 60s onward explode in a way that we have not seen up till janway blew the source of that advancement sky high.   


Then we got enterprise, I forget the guy's name, think he was the science officer? Seems like he had a thing for stealing future tech from that one guy.  T.O.S Flew into the unwon with outdated tech and ship to the one we see in discovery.   
 The tech you see in both discovery and in enterprise is tech that should not have existed in their timeline. Fro kirk the transporter was new, yet for Archer, it was also new. Shields were not an advent of Archer's time, yet his ship was shield near the end.   


  One of the few joys I get from the whore that is std.  It's cheap and all it wants to do is fulfill our base instinct as apes, with action and violence. Yet I do like watching how the tech advanced from such abuses of time.   
 I also kind of like how they never bother to tell you this fact. Alternative timelines can be fun. Still miss the Og premise of star trek, with battle star Galactica and stargate (insert subtext here) We have plenty of space action shows, shit I think I forgot babolain five.   


 I don't know, it makes star trek feel dirtier like it was used in some fowl way."
1,"Personally, I'm really hoping for some more classic TNG type storylines. We've got a solid crew now, let the show grow the beard and explore strange new worlds. I'd be happy with some overarching storylines throughout, certainly, especially as Picard reconciles with his new existence.

1,Why did Scotty carry the injured trainee up to the bridge? Was it just for dramatic effect?
1,"This episode has left me in awe, while simultaneously crushing my soul. This is such a beautiful way to preserve a species and their culture. But giving someone a life they never knew they wanted, only to take it away is more than cruel. 

Stewart perfectly displayed the inner conflict as he desperately tried holding on to the enterprise. Towards the end I was almost sad that this wasn't his real life and even more so that this civilisation had been dead for a thousand years. Nearly burst into tears when Picard opened the box to find the flute. 

Definitely going on the favourites list!"

1,"The only example I can think of offhand is with the development of the Ferengi. 

There was a bunch of stuff that Roddenberry wanted with the Ferengi, and somewhere along the way a Ferengi Memo was drafted. It was pretty bad, and one of the things Roddenberry wanted was for the male Ferengi to have an attraction to human women (and multiple female human partners), to be very well endowed, and to wear large codpieces. Roddenberry wanted Herb Wright, a writer, to create the Ferengi with those characteristics. Herb refused, and said something to the effect of: “Gene, we’re doing that with the Ferengi; it’s terrible, and Children will watch this show.” Fortunately, those aspects of the Ferengi were scrapped."

1,"In the early 2300's a group of starships, some Starfleet, some from other Federation worlds, some from Klingons, Romulans, and other races, are all attracted to a strange signal. They arrive to where this signal is, then they all lose all their sensor data and communications.

The Federation, having detected sensor distortion from that area and now a loss of communication from all starships, sends out a ship to see what happened. It is all empty space - no starships, no warp trails, or indication that anything was ever there.

Throughout the Federation rumors spread about disappearing starships. Political disputes broke out because each side claimed others attacked them - that they have new weapons and that their ships are still out there. After many years, when it became clear that this was a mystery, it became a distant memory.

Then, 46 years after the initial incident, the same strange signal appeared. Being careful, Starfleet sent a science ship to a safe distance away from the anomaly. The same happened, with strange distortion coming from the signal, but this ship was far away enough that it wasn't affected. However, this time, with the distortion, there was a message - from their lost starships.

It appears that they were transported to a far away galaxy. That after nearly a decade of in-fighting over resources and planets, the different races realized that they needed to work together. The area of space that they are in is not lush with planets, and even fewer are M-Class. So far, they have not discovered any intelligent life. It is suspected that they are in a newer part of space, one that is earlier in evolution than the Milky Way.

Starfleet, using old records, notes that exactly 46 years prior to the initial incident, a similar signal was detected, but this was in deep space at the time, and not something that they were able to investigate.

46 years later, and Starfleet has realized that they can send supplies to the others - they take a group of starships and load them with supplies, food, latest technology, the last near-century of history, as well as all the research that Starfleet had been doing to get them home. They also sent through a message so that if they weren't close by, they would know to pick up the supplies. The same distortion happens, but this time, no message attached.

46 years pass again, and we are approaching the mid 25th Century. Starfleet's top experts on the Anomaly think they almost have enough data to figure out a way home. They know that they may be trying to bring home people who don't want to come back, seeing how it has been generations since they disappeared, but if they are able to create a link between these two galaxies, who knows what that could mean for the Federation and scientific exploration.

So Starfleet builds a new ship purpose built to this mission, with the technology to safely use the Anomaly to reach the other galaxy, and then once there, to find a way to open a gateway home. This vessel would be lightly crewed, with the idea that they would build the crew from those on the other side.

So the ship arrives at the site of the Anomaly. The time arrives, their sensors go crazy and lose communication. And then everything comes back on, and all of the stars have moved. There are no Federation signals - no signals of any kind.

Then they notice what looks like a series of powered down starships. They fly over to see the fleet that was sent in 46 years years ago with supplies. They travel to the ships to see that they are all untouched - the supplies are in the same state as they were in half a century ago. Ship systems shut off to conserve power. No one had ever been there.

They do a scan of the local area of systems, and finds one that has an M-Class planet. They travel there only to discover the remains of a small city, with a dead starship in orbit. They can't find any sign of life, but do find one log entry on the ship. It is from over 50 years ago, and just says 'We found intelligent life. If you are reading this, don't let it find you.'

\--

So the show would follow this starship as they try to figure out what happened, if anyone is still around, and what this threat would be. I think it would be really cool if the Excelsior was one of the ships that was lost, so that you could open with Captain Sulu (and give the opportunity to have him appear via flashbacks)."
0,"It kinda makes sense, and it even explains hyperspace tracking. 

The rebellion is trying to get the artefact away, but snoke/ren/something force related can sense the movement of the artefact through hyperspace, which shouldn't be possible

The movie is about protecting the artefact so that luke or rey can use it against snoke or something, but eventually the revelation is that the lives of the resistance are worth more, so holdo stays behind jump the ship far, far away and let the rebels escape.

The first order discovers the transports, holdo does her thing, and the same thing that lets them track the artefact through hyperspace is what makes the ship have physical presence when jumping, letting it destroy the fleet.

It makes both hyperspace tracking but much more importantly the holdo maneuver into one-offs that don't break the in-univerwe mechanics of hyperspace. Sure it could in theory be replicated, but no one understood how the artifact works, and it's tens of thousands did years old

What do you think"
1,"Sorry if these are very frequently asked or technically wrong questions... Watching TOS, just realized that the Enterprise does not time-travel despite being faster than that the speed of light. Googled and found this is because of being in the Warp Drive bubble. The mechanism makes space-time move rather than the ship.  I still don't understand what that means though, e.g. why warping doesn't result in time-travel - they end up warping to a different location, but how come time still passes at a normal rate at &gt;c?  Also if they're in a ""bubble"" surrounded by negative mass, how come other passing objects around them still affect them and so often throw the seated passengers off balance🙃?

Also in The Alternative Factor, why do Kirk and Spock say ""ooh what if the matter and antimatter versions meet, they'll blow everything up"" because isn't that an everyday mechanism they use for the Warp Drive engine? Is it because the engine has a smaller, contained reaction when compared to the scale or the amount of matter/antimatter in the two Lazaruses?"
0,"Lets be honest, we are the most divided fanbase in the world. Whether you hate the new trilogy or love it, the division isn't good for the future of the IP (most big-name directors/actors want a piece in marvel over Star Wars because of the toxicity alone). The people who hate it will continue to do so and vice versa for it's supporters. I think the only solution is to do what Marvel, DC, Gundam, and many others have done and create 2 universes by making ""Legends"" into a separate universe instead of dismissing it. Disney already wants to make multiple Star Wars productions and doesn't know where to go next, why not bridge the gap and give both sides what they want? The bickering, fighting, etc. can finally end and everyone can walk away a winner (especially Disney). In my mind this seems like a win-win, but I would love to hear your opinions on what should be done about this war amongst fans."
1,"&gt;&gt; RED ALERT &lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt; SPOILERS &lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt; RED ALERT &lt;&lt; (or Reed Alert if you want)

In the crash depicted in the episode (Harry's first attempt to fix things), Seven receives the updated phase corrections through her cranial implant, but they fail and they get thrown out of the slipstream. Tom states that they are ""just a few parsecs from the Alpha Quadrant"" and then Voyager crashes into the ice planet. The time between Seven receiving the corrections and leaving slipstream lasts 22 seconds.

In future Harry's second attempt, Seven receives the new phase corrections and both Voyager and the Delta Flyer leave slipstream without incident. The time between Seven receiving the corrections and leaving slipstream lasts 24 seconds.

Shouldn't Voyager have reached the Alpha Quadrant border by the end of the episode? A parsec is equivalent to 3.26ly. A few parsecs from the border is trivial using warp drive.

But for the rest of the series, it is depicted that Voyager is well within the Delta Quadrant, and from Janeway's log, they only saved 10 years (10,000ly), and haven't even crossed into Beta yet."
1,"I recently binged VOY and am now almost done with TNG, and find myself thinking it would have been a fun side-project to keep a running tally of quirky things that happened in those shows, and if I ever go back and re-binge them I definitely would.  I plan on moving on to DS9 next and don't want to miss this opportunity.

For example, if I ever re-watch VOY I'm keeping a running count of the number of shuttlecraft that get destroyed, every mention of leola root, or every time someone brings up ""memory engrams.""  For TNG, it could be every time they modify a photon torpedo, someone tells Wesley to shut up, or number of times Riker plays his trombone.

For DS9, I'm thinking of every time someone orders a raktajino, or we see/hear mention of Odo's bucket, or we hear someone yell out ""Dabo!""  But it's been a while since I've watched the show so I don't remember all the little details very well.  What are some things you would suggest?"

0,"We only get to see him if my memory serves correctly one battle before he start thinking about turning sides.

Then he is back to the base after catching up with Poe and he escapes.

I would have preferred if maybe near the halfway point in the movie he turned. Having him like actually kill innocent/ or struggle to kill innocent/good rebels and citizen. 

Constantly getting backlash from his commrades/ supervisor. Death threats from Kylo Ren, and Phasma(Wasted character) and then he makes the decision to turn sides after seeing/dealing with how awful the stormtroopers mistreatment is and how bad he feels for the lives he is helping destroying.

He turned good too quick that’s all I’m saying."

0,"Boba was on the sail barge when all of Jabba's guards on board the skiff were killed by Luke Han Chewie and Lando. Leaving those four as the only on board.

Boba Fett was overlooking them with a scoped rifle, missile jetpack.
Instead of firing his missile to destroy the skiff and kill all four targets including the supposed Last Jedi, or using his scoped rifle to kill Luke and take the other three alive, he decides to close the distance, Landing right next to Luke and instead of pulling the trigger instantly, he gives Luke a chance to turn around and disarm him, doing nothing and falling.
Instead of drawing a secondary pistol, using any of his gadgets, he shoots a rope dart around Luke and doesn't use his wrist Blaster, flamethrower, knee darts, pistol, or any bladed weapon he may have, he just patiently waits for luke to cut the rope and gets knocked out.

Finally he regains Consciousness, turning his back to longtime enemies Han Solo and Chewbacca to try and shoot Luke, aiming miles above his head with his wrist Blaster he could have used moments earlier, missing as if he's never used the gadget before, nor did he use his missile to blow up the other skiff, instead he gets hit in the back by his opponent who was saying his name and armed, flailing into the sarlacc pit screaming the entire way and doing nothing to prevent himself from falling inside.

Not trying to rip on Return of the Jedi here, but compared to how he was depicted in Empire Strikes Back, and even the prequels as a child. I think Boba Fett must have gotten too many drinks at Jabba's Palace earlier in the day. That's my only explanation for his questionable Battle Tactics. And I don't see a lot of people pointing out the fact that he has a missile jetpack and didn't simply choose to blow up this skiff from a safe distance or use his rifle Beyond Point Blank Range against a Jedi."
1,I just woke up from one. I was Tom Paris and aliens were keeping me in a simulation. Sort of a Riker/Future Imperfect situation.
1,"So in this episode Captian Picard helped to set up a blockade that put out a tachyon detectors to be able to detect any cloaked Romulan ships. Since there is a limit on how far the federation ships could broadcast the beam (also assuming that ships were broadcasting in a 360° field), why couldn't the Romulans go to warp while flying in the positive z direction (up) until they were out of range then come back down to go around the blockade. I guess this could be asked of almost any blockade that doesn't surround the objective, but I am having a hard time to wrap my brain around this since and Kirk pointed out to Kahn space is 3D."
0,They look great! So happy about that.
1,I've been watching Wonder Years recently and kinda wishing Fred Savage was in front of the camera more. It got me thinking about what kind of Star Trek captain he might make. He's a little neurotic so I thought maybe one that is an Autistic Savant? After they went older with Picard the next 3 (4 if you count Pine's Kirk) were much younger and more physical. I'd really like to see another older Captain and Mandy Patinkin would be pretty freaking awesome. I think Regina King would make a kick ass Captain too but she's kind of blown up recently so I dunno if she'd want a series now.
1,What if q played a practical joke on the federation where he erased everyone's memory and put four pips on everyone's collar.  And what if he did it during the dominion war.  It would cause total chaos as everyone tried to figure out who the captain is and who outranks who.   But it would be hilarious.  Let me know what you think in the comments.
0,"Do you think we will ever seen the Sith in the High Republic. Personally, I'm finding it very refreshing to have non-Sith villains like the Nihil and the Drengir for a change, but I cannot forget that there are two Sith Lords out there somewhere, biding their time, advancing the Grand Plan...I wonder if they're somehow using the Nihil to achieve their own ends, or if a character who has already been introduced will turn out to be a Sith Lord, perhaps a politician...I am aware that there can't really be an open confrontation between the Jedi and Sith as the Jedi have seen no sign of them on the Phantom Menace, but they are out there somewhere....any Jedi who do face them obviously won't survive, but do you think we will ever see them? Would you want to see them? I suppose judging by Legends, the Sith right now might be Darth Tenebrous and his Master, or, depending on how long Muuns live, Tenebrous and Plagueis?

Personall, I do think the Sith will appear at some point, but probably not for a long time, as the focus is clearly on the Nihil and I'm fine with that, but obviously the writers are fully aware that the Sith are out there, too, and I bet they've figured out who they are and what they're doing. Maybe they won't be revealed until the Acolyte TV series, but I suspect they'll get a cameo before that, perhaps at the end of the final Phase One book....

1,"TRIGGER WARNING: sexual assault 


So I've started a rewatch for the first time in years and noticed something I haven't before.

When Janeway talks to The Caretaker the 2nd time he admits he is dying and was stealing people to try find a genetic match to procreate with.... The subjects of failed procreation attempts were sent to the Occampans planet with a fatal illness.

Does that mean The Caretaker in some way r*ped Harry and B'Ellana? No not in the traditional human sense. Whatever his form of procreation is, it is invasive enough to result in an illness even he can't cure.

The intent of procreating without consent when the result of a failed attempt is illness and death sounds like a special kind of sci fi r*pe to me.

If I were Voyager I wouldn't be looking for the 2nd Caretaker being if that's what they are capable of.

Side note : if The Caretaker couldn't cure their illness how could Voyager? Or was it a case of him not giving a fuck?"
1,"I only started just over a week ago (and I’m already on season 4 lmao) and it’s actually funny? I like a lot of the ideas and stories but I genuinely find myself laughing at a lot of the lines. I think it’s because there’s a lot of sarcasm which as a British person I find quite funny. Besides that I’m really enjoying it, and to be honest I’ve loved most Star Trek I’ve watched. I’ve watched Enterprise, TNG, Disco, and all the films. I know a lot of, perhaps the older, Star Trek fans dislike Disco but I think it’s fantastic and is a great change of pace from having the senior staff as the protagonists. One thing I do find annoying about being a Star Trek fan is that since I’m 16 I don’t really know anyone else my age who’s a big Trekkie, although I have tried to nudge people into watching some."
0,"*Q. You did American Graffiti for George Lucas, playing the role of Bob Falfa. Did he call you again for Star Wars , or how did you get the ‘Han Solo’ part.* 

A. I made no effort because George had let it be known to the agents that he wasn’t going to use anybody he’d used in American Graffiti. So I didn’t think about it. I didn’t enter into the picture until about 3 or 4 weeks before they were due to make the decision. I was asked to do a video tape test, which I did, and then they asked me to help them with other people’s video tape test... it seems like I must have done 75. Then I was told they wanted me to do the part, and that was it. I didn’t even have a script. 

*Q. When you made Star Wars , what did you think of the film and the part you were taking?* 

A. I thought it was real good part - the character was humorous, and I thought that those things that weren’t exactly funny in the script, probably would be … I thought it was going to be funny. I didn’t think it was going to have such a wide audience, it was just a good part for me! I never tried to judge whether this was going to be successful or whether people would like it. For me, it was a simple opportunity to play a character that I knew the audience would like. It was the first time a character I had played was so important to the film. It was necessary that this character worked, as necessary for them as it was for me - so, that opens up a kind of atmosphere, a good environment for collaboration. 

*Q. How did you actually get into movies?* 

A. When I first came out here I wanted to be in movies, I came out here to be in movies, but I didn’t even know what the names of the major motion picture studios were. We stopped in Laguna Beach where we saw the ocean for the first time and rented an apartment. It was close enough to Los Angeles to get a little grubstake. We had taken a month to go across the country, so it was a good rest spot. I did a play in Laguna Beach, John Brown’s Body , and somebody, a man named E.M. Bernard who was doing the music to that play, was also doing the music for Laugh-in and had some link to Columbia Pictures. He asked me if I would like to meet the guy who was head of casting for Columbia. I said “sure, why not” - it was the first time I had ever been in a movie studio. I went in to this huge paneled office, and there was this guy talking on two phones, and another guy behind him on another two phones, literally, and 1 sat in a straight-back chair for about 10 minutes while they talked big bucks, big names. They kept switching from one phone to another, covering one mouthpiece, then the other mouthpiece, and shouting back and forth - just like in the movies. You know, I thought they were probably doing it for my benefit -1 couldn’t imagine how life could so imitate the movies. But sure enough, it was for real and finally the first guy finishes up and turns to me and says “What’s your name?”. I said, “Harrison Ford”. He said, “Who sent you?” I said, “E.M. Bernard”. He asks the guy behind him who E.M. Bernard was and the other guy says, “Never heard of him.” He said “How tall are you?"" “6’1,6’0” How much ya weigh?” “190” - now he’s giving me a little 3x5 card to put the information on. “Do you ride a horse?” “Any other special hobbies, talents, etc.” Finally, “thanks, we’ll see ya!” I walked out, went down the hall to the elevators, realized I had to use the bathroom. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out, his assistant is coming down the hall, saying to me, “Come back, he wants to talk to you.” If I’d gone on the elevator, I would have been gone and nobody would have bothered to chase me. When I went back, the first thing the guy says is “How’d you like to be on a contract?” I said, “How much?” The guy says “7-year contract for $150/week.” It wasn’t great, but it was my introduction. I had been in California for six months, I wanted to be an actor, and all of a sudden, I “were’ one."
0,"We all know that Leia saying that she remembered her mother in Return of the Jedi is one of the most puzzled over lines in the OT since in the prequels Padme dies shortly after childbirth. But my theory is this: 
We all know that Leia is force sensitive, in fact she was only one day away from completing her training to become a jedi knight. Well what if during her childhood on Alderan, Leia had force visions of Padme.Bail Organna knowing the consequences of what would happen if the empire found out who she was, convinced her it was just memories. We know that she’s had other visions in the movies and comics, and so it would stay in character for her. Plus Bail was one of the few people to know her past, and would obviously want to keep her from knowing her true self to protect her. And since she seemed to have only vague memories it would seem she had these visions at a young age, and she could be easily convinced it was just a memory since she was young and didn’t have a ton of critical thinking skills yet. It’s just a theory, but it seems like it could be a possible explanation. Lemme know what y’all think"
0,"I know she couldn't be in the OT films because of when her character was created,  but I almost swear we see her as a youngling in the temple in Attack of the Clones when Obi Wan visits Yoda and the younglings to ask about the map before discovering the Clones. A youngling of her species lifts her helmet in that scene for a split second.

But also, someone says Vader kills her in a past discussion 3 years ago. But now, Mandalorian is after Vader's death and she is in the Mandalorian's timeline. So, is it theory that she could actually be alive? And in so, why wasn't she part of the fight against Kyle Ren/Snoke?"
0,I need cosplay ideas . I'm 5'8 and skinny. I understand i can be anyone but i enjoy being accurate as possible. For example i can't do captain America because he's like 6'4 and a strong super solider
0,"Now I know for some people its just a meme for meme sake or a way to bash legends so if you are one of those people I'm not trying to change your mind. But if you're someone who's never read FotJ and only see the meme mentioned on message boards and want to know what really happens then this post is for you. I'll add some TLDR's at the end but I'm basically going to go book by book. 

But before that I want to mention something outside of Fate or any other series that I think (aside from Anti-Legends people) causes people to think Luke is some kind of force god. IF you go on to Wook you will see that he has a long list of force powers. More powers than any other Jedi on the wook. And even though we have seen multiple other jedi do the same things we have done we have never seen someone do all of them. But the simple explanation isn't that he is some force god. Its that he is the character with the most screen time. Give other jedi 70 books worth of apperances and they will rack up a large move set as well. So I get why some people are under the mistaken belief  that Luke is some sort of force deity. But as I'm going to show he was in no way unbeatable in FotJ nor was he able to destroy Abeloth by himself. 

Outcast: No fights or battles in this one only Ben and Luke learning new techniques. They learn them quickly because the Baran Do sages are using techniques close to what Jedi use.

Omen: Again no battles in this one. Luke does learn to teleport a small object but its more of a part trick for him and less like what Merrin or Mother Talzin can do. 

Abyss: Finally the action starts as the Lost Tribe arrives on the scene. Now something that needs to be said about them is that except for Vestara and the high lords most of the sith are pretty weak. They have been marooned on a planet for 5000 years so they aren't seasoned warriors and their saber styles are way out of date. Still the Lost Tribe members are strong enough that they are able to nearly overwhelm the two Jedi.

Backlash: This is where Luke really starts to get beat up. First he gets sideswiped off his speeder bike by a rancore and goes careening through the jungle. Then while fighting a group of nightsisters he is injured and nearly knocked out and would have died if not for being rescued by his son. 

Allies: Luke, his son, vestara, and around a thousand lost tribe sith and two high lords go to Abeloth's planet to capture or kill her. Abeloth is able to kill the majority of the sith though either force attacks, controlling the plant and animal life, or physically while some are taken out by Luke and Ben when they try and turn on them when it looks like they had finally beaten Abeloth. Still at the end of the day Luke, Ben, Vestara, and two high lords are able to ""kill"" abeloth. And during this Luke ends up more injured and battered than the last time. 

Vortex: Realizing that Abeloth wasn't dead but had moved her spirit into another body (Abeloth by the way for anyone who doesn't know is similar in power and abilities to the Mortis ones. She was in fact the Mother for a time) and had fled. They track her down to a planet where the Fallanassi are located and there Luke and Ben and face off against a Sith Saber and a Sith High Lord who are now helping Abeloth with Vestara at first helping the Sith then helping Luke and Ben. During this fight Luke ends up sustaining broken bones, severe lacerations, and head trauma and its only with Vestara distracting Abeloth (who had already been wounded from the earlier battle) and by giving himself up to the force and possible death is he barely able to defeat her by pulling the roof down on them and impaling her. 

Now before moving on I need to say that the more bodies Abeloth takes the more it spreads out her power and the more it weakens all the bodies. And if one body is destroyed it weakens all the others. It also takes her a long time to heal up from loosing a body and being able to take another. 

Conviction: Still hurt from the last battle Luke and Ben and Ves travel to the planet Nam Chorios where they again run into Abeloth and the Lost Tribe. Use of the force on Nam Chorios is dangerous due to it causing storms across the planet so Luke, Ves, and Ben are unable to use any powers while fighting Abeloth and the Sith. And in fact they are only able to win against the Sith and Abeloth in this fight due to the use of a improvised flash bang that incapacitates the Sith and allows Abeloth to flee. Though she doesn't get off without being increasingly damaged. 

 Ascension: Abeloth visits the Lost Tribe's homeworld of Kesh where she ends up attacking and being attacked by the Grand Lord of the Sith. An attack that cuts her to the core and causes her to lash out in pain destroying the city and loosing her ability to maintain a solid form and turning into a puddle of goup. Luke and a bunch of Jedi meanwhile are investigating an ancient sith world where sith apparently liked to go into tunnels and get high and he and the other jedi have to run away from at first a huge explosion of force power that they are only barely able to get far enough away from. And then have to escape from exploding volcanoes and floods of lava and ash. 

No use of green lighting/electric judgement, no absorbing energy or force powers during fights or in explosions, no controlling lava tsunami's or flying through lava unharmed like his father, no using shatter point, nothing like that so far. 

Apocalypse: Well here we are the final battle. And this one is a doozy. The Lost Tribe have taken the Jedi Temple and the Jedi order along with 300 shock troopers have to take it back. During the fight towards the shield generator Luke, Jaina, and Corran all take massive damage including a concussion causing double vision, a severe laceration along his side making it hard to move, and near exhaustion from drawing on the force to keep going for three days. And during the battle against the pursuing sith  and Abeloth Luke will get his chest and ribs cracked and electrocuted by force lighting. 

The Sith Lord who turns out to be Abeloth is only defeated when Tahiri Vela and Boba Fett destroy another of Abeloth's bodies on a distant moon weakening her for a moment and allowing Luke to fully slice through the body. 

After getting to rest in a bacta tank for three days the group goes off in search of one of Abeloth's two remaining ~~hocruxes~~ bodies while the jedi try to destroy the other one. 

When they finally get to Abeloth's planet three battles are happening at the same time. One on Coruscant with a Jedi Master, a Jedi knight, and a squad of spec forces fighting her avatar on coruscant, a fight on Abeloth's planet physically where Ben and Vestara are fighting her physical body, and a fight inside the force on Mortis where Luke and a mysterious dark stranger (Its Darth Krayt and I hate that he is there but he is) are fighting her spiritual body. Luke and Krayt are only able to defeat her after both her physical avatars are destroyed by the other Jedi and even then they both come out horribly wounded with Luke being near brain dead from damage and exhaustion. 

 Three months later after extensive sessions of healing trances and bacta baths Luke finally comes out of a coma and is still feverish and weak.

And to top it all off Abeloth isn't really killed the way we would think of killing something and more like banished and having to reform herself. Not knowing how long it will take Luke sends off ten knights to hunt down the Dagger of Mortis which according to legend is the only weapon that could kill her for good. 

So there it is. In Fate Luke is never alone when he fights Abeloth and is ever only able to kill her physical avatars because other people were fighting her and distracting her or had weakened her by killing another of her bodies. And during all of that Luke never uses any of the higher level force powers we know he can use or has used in other books. 

So TLDR: In EVERY SINGLE BOOK Luke gets injured and hurt or nearly defeated by opponents and when facing Abeloth requires the help of others to defeat her and doesn't even really kill her in the end but only banishes her. 

So no he isn't a force god. No he doesn't take on Abeloth alone. And no he doesn't use any crazy force powers. Sure if you read the Wook he has more than anyone else but that's because he's been in more books than anyone else since he is kind of the main character of the OT and NR era's. 

I don't know if this has changed anyone's minds but at least when people start saying he took down a force deity by himself you can link to this rant."

The equation for determining hyperspace speeds shall be as follows: Y=1/X, where Y shall be the maximum speed of the hyperdrive, mesaured in lightyears per second, with one light year being defined as 31557600 light seconds. X will be the rating of the hyperdrive.

I enjoyed the variety of Jedi that the story presented but I do feel there were too many view points, especially the ""one chapter"" characters, personal highlights were Bel Zettifar and Loden Greatstorm, loved those guys.

Now I'm fully aware that I'm a 23 year old, this book is not meant for me, it had some great moments however, wish there was a bit more age variety in the characters but again, this is meant for 7-11 year olds so makes sense with the ages that were there, also the story was incredibly dark and depressing for a kids book... I do like Vernestra and Imri as a pair, I wasn't too keen on Honesty but I liked Avon's constant questioning and challenging, J-6 was a nice breath of fresh air and an insight into the droids of the era and how they act.

into the Dark- 8/10
Reath Silas was an amazing protagonist who went through the biggest journey out of all of the characters so far in the series as a whole. All the supporting characters added depth to the story as a whole a part from Affie, I just didn't dig her. I think the only actual downside is that there is A LOT of back and forth with the plot, character has to go here, gets back, has to go to another place, then back again. If you've read it, you know exactly what I'm talking about. That's why it's an 8 but I'm looking forward to following Reath's journey in the future!

Luke's says ""know"", as in know the difference between good and bad in terms of the light and dark sides of the Force. In Vader suddenly talking about Obi-Wan, Luke briefly become angry. Thanks to his training with Yoda however, he knows how to recognize the difference between good and bad and not succumb to the dark side by giving in to negative emotions (anger in this instance). Watch his expressions closely. He becomes angry, then objectively sort of sees the the good and bad before him (says, ""Know...""), then is able to let the anger go.

Remember that he and Yoda talk about knowing the difference between good and bad. Yoda tells him, ""You will know.""

Also, in ROTJ, Luke says ""know"" in the same way to the Emperor in the same kind of situation. He does says a little weaker as the Emperor is extremely adept at manipulation people's emotions.

Another returning Trek director, having worked on an episode of ST: Disco, as well as episodes of Hannibal, American Gods and Netflix’s upcoming superhero show Jupiter’s Legacy, is Christopher Byrne.

According to one interview Jonathan Frakes will be coming in to direct some SNW, as well.

And another one-time Star Trek actor-turned director who’s name is on a couple production sites associated with SNW is Leslie Hope, who played Kira Meru, Major Kira Nerys’s mother on DS9 and went on to direct episodes of Law &amp; Order: SVU, Netflix’s Lost in Space, Snowpiercer, Aftermath, and more.

Years ago, I got a physical board that used magnets so you could invert the attack boards.  I looked for rules and didn't find any I liked so I created my own.

A year ago I took the /r tridimensionalchess subreddit.  I did it because the pandemic had hit and I thought, why not?  It never got popular and honestly I don't think it will, but it's there.

Now, I got TTS on sale and looked for Tridimensional Chessboard.  They existed and were pretty but all the comments would complain that they were non-functional.  No one had made a functional tridimensional chessboard.

So I've done it myself.

The code is rough and I don't think TTS was made to create true three dimensional play BUT it works.

You can:

* select a piece then select a square to move the piece to that square
* select a piece then select another piece of opposite color to take the piece.  The taken piece ends up under the board; I may create an area where these go later.
* Select an attack board peg that has an attackboard over and under it to select it, then select another peg to move it.  The pieces moves with the board.

I may have my own rules but I made the board independent of those.  You can play how you want.  I'm very happy with how it turned out and just wanted to share it with the world."

While exploring the ruins alone, Ben stumbles and falls into an ancient chamber, with a broken leg, and his communicator damaged, there is no way out for him. He spends weeks waiting for Luke to find him, but he never does(little does he know the Dark side energy of the temple prevents Luke from sensing him.) only sustained off of small reptiles and pools of water, Kylo finally goes to explore the temple. He hears a voice call out to him, it's a sith holocron, beckoning him to draw closer.  Kylo gives in and touches the artifact. It reveals to him that Luke and Jason have left days before, believing Ben dead. This throws him into a rage. Taking out his Jedi saber and slashing away at the walls of the temple, but he accidentally discovers a ancient saber storage room, and finds one lone saber calling to him..... a ancient blade that is fierce and un pure(hence why it seems to be unstable) the holocron tells him he can get out of here, if he will listen to it. Weeks go by with Ben learning the ways of the dark side. Taking up the Ancient blade as his own. After over a month of being trapped in that ruin. He finally breaks free. But without a ship. He scours the planet for a ship, all he finds is a broken Jedi fighter, but repairable. He gets to work immediately. Using anything he has at his disposal to get the ship space worthy.

1,"When this movie came out, I initially hated it. I thought Star Trek was moving towards more dumbed down action and abandoning all of the cerebral nuance, philosophy, and ethics that made the franchise so intellectually stimulating. Come to find out, I was kinda right about that, but the later trek that I take issue with lacks the stylish yet faithful visuals, the clear respect for the characters, and the ability to tell a great story that reinvents a 50 year old franchise while keeping the spirit of what most people identify with. I've always loved the cast with the exception of Chris Pine as Kirk. When I was a kid and originally saw the movie, I didn't understand why all the characters seemed the same except for Kirk, but now I'm able to appreciate the immense writing talent it takes to rewrite a character that never had a father. A reckless, undisciplined Kirk that doesn't care for protocol or taking things seriously, although I don't care much for into darkness or beyond, I love how we got to see this kirk mature and grow into the kirk we've always known and loved. I also loved how they incorporated Leonard Nimoy and time travel in a way that made sense and didn't just seem like pointless fan service. Overall, I think this was a cash grab that accidentally became an amazing movie due to the immense talent that worked on it. A reboot of such a beloved franchise will always be met with its fair share of criticism, but after watching it again recently, it is truly a great movie."

Ok since this one is so long I will divide it into 2 separate parts, it was originally one big thread but I decided its best to make it 2 threads. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background info:**

* Instead of 10 years its only been 1 since the events of Episode I, (phantom menace takes place in 23 BBy).
* The Clone Wars has already begun, after the ending of Phantom Menace the C.I.S was formed and split from the Republic, there was unrest in the senate as their peace was being threatened, half the senate were pro war, half were anti war but ultimately the more votes went to war so the Chancellor decided to utilize the Clone Army which showed up at the end of Episode I as the army claim they were sent by a Jedi master, Sifo Dyas who was killed offscreen during the events of Phantom Menace. The Clone Wars has been happening for 2 years and they are trying to figure out where the C.I.S base is.
* The leader of the C.I.S is a Jedi turned Sith named Count Dooku and since the Jedi have been trying to figure out who the secret Sith is, they are extra eager to find the Separatist base so they can capture Dooku, end the war and find out who the secret Sith Lord is.
* As for Anakin &amp; Padme, they have become good friends and at night time Anakin &amp; Padme are sneaking out into the city of Coruscant for mini dates, the only one who is aware is Obi Wan Kenobi who doesn't turn Anakin in because he promised a dying Qui Gon Jinn he'd train the chosen one. Padme has passed the torch of queen of Naboo and she is now a member of the senate on Coruscant

**The Story:**

* The main plotline is trying to find the C.I.S base. But at the same time Anakin is starting to have premonitions of his mother dying and its tearing him apart. The Jedi haven't allowed him to visit his mother &amp; brother on Tatooine because the Jedi aren't meant to have relations.
* In the opening scene Obi Wan gets a strange messages saying ""you took everything from me, now I will take everything from you"" then that night in Coruscant there is an attempt on Anakin's life while he's seeing Padme. The bounty hunter who attacked him is a shapeshifter and there is an extended chase through Coruscant where she changes form numerous time it leads to a bar where she goes in for the kill before Anakin &amp; Obi Wan immobilize her by getting her in the leg. She is about to reveal who sent her before an unseen killer fires a toxic dart into her.
* The origins of the Clone army is still unknown and they have no leads beyond Sifo Dyas sent them, as well as that its unknown exactly who killed Dyas. The clones have the command of not revealing where they came from embedded into their chips.
* Anakin's night terrors are getting to him so he decides he must go back to Tatooine to save his mother. In the thick of night of he sneaks off to Tatooine which when Mace Windu finds out about it pisses him off, (Anakin v Mace Windu have a rivalry in all 3 of these films), Obi Wan is pissed when he finds out but Yoda thinks its great that Anakin is looking out for his family.
* Obi Wan reveals he has been doing some research and has traced the toxic dart to a species called Kaminoans who reside on the watery planet of Kamino just outside the Republic, its said they are cloners and Obi Wan is sent to investigate the planet and try find out if they are the creators the Clone Army. When Obi Wan leaves however unknown to him a hooded figure on Coruscant shoots a tracking device onto his ship.
* So when Anakin goes to Tatooine &amp; Obi Wan goes to Kamino that portion of the film is the same as the real one with one addition. Obi Wan on Kamino is the exact same. Anakin one Tatooine as well except he is excited to see Owen Skywalker his blood brother and is happy to see him free, of course Shmi's death is the same and Anakin murders the Sand People the same.
* In the outer rim territories various Clone units are deployed to different planets, a large group of Clone Trooper's lead by Commander Cody land on the planet of Geonosis and begin their search of the planet. They find a whole lot of C.I.S ships and contact Master Windu to tell him. Then they are attacked by a group of droids and a Sith Lord who shoots them with lightning when all the droids are dead. Only commander Cody makes it out alive.
* Since Obi Wan is heading to Geonosis following Jango Fett, the hooded figure who has been following Obi Wan is following the both of them.
* Master Windu decides to go with a bunch of Jedi and an entire legion of Clone Trooper's (the 187th wearing purple armor) to Geonosis.
* The whole scene in the Asteroid field is the same however Obi Wan on the Asteroid is not something we see.
* Immediately the bounty hunter lands on the planet he enters a dark room and is followed by that hooded figure (who we don't see), the hooded figure tells Fett he stole his kill in a very angry voice then he begins to force choke the man before unveiling a double bladed red lightsaber and cutting him in two.
* Next it's revealed Obi Wan survived the asteroids but his ship was damaged and now he is crash landing into the planet. He sends a message to grand master Yoda who is on his way to Geonosis to come rescue him, Yoda tells him they are on their way. Obi Wan is then captured like in the real film. Obi Wan before he is captured though finds Commander Cody and he too is captured with him.
* Anakin on Tatooine senses Obi Wan is in danger and he tells Padme he's going to rescue Obi Wan, Cliegg Lars as a gift tells Anakin he can take C3PO with him, and this is where R2D2 meets C3PO for the first time. He tells Padme to stay there and she ""agrees"", (she stows away onboard ofc) and Anakin heads for Geonosis.
* So everyone is heading for the C.I.S home world.

0,"Oh my God. I know Clone Wars gets a lot darker as the seasons go by, but already I am devastated with the tragedy of Anakin and Order 66. The scene that hit me the most was the part where Anakin was told to wait in the Council Chambers, and he look out the window in sadness. Padme, at home miles away, also goes to the window, looking through it with sad eyes. Both begin to cry, but Anakin's expression hits me hardest, when both know that things are not going to be well."

0,"Has John Boyega commented on the Mandalorian ?

Star Wars screwed him over big time. Which is sad because he was a legit fan of star wars. Called out the dumb they fly now line. Because he know they have been using them since the clone wars basically he’s an actual fan and they screwed him. I remember a reporter asked him if he would come back. He said something like you ain’t going to Disney plus me. Which I don’t blame if you’ve just been screwed by Disney he probably thought the Disney plus shows would be some low budget type of CW or agents of shield show. 

Now that we have seen the mandalorian is pretty much some of the best star wars we have ever gotten. Has he tweeted or made any comments about Disney plus or the show or Star Wars in general ?"

0,"I have been thinking about my rank list of Star Wars Episode Movies and I feel like I went with the crowd for the most part on liking the first two Star Wars Movies, I come to the conclusion that while not bad movies, that Episode IV and Episode V are actually my least favorite movies in the Franchise.

My rank list is;

1st- Return of the Jedi

2nd- Revenge of the Sith

3rd- The Force Awaken

4th- The Last Jedi

5th- Attack of The Clones

6th/7th- The Rise of Skywalker

6th/7th- The Phantom Menance 

8th- A New Hope

9th- The Empire Strikes Back

TRS and TPM are interchangeable because I didn't see Episode 1 growing up and The Rise of Skywalker felt like it needed to explain more clearly. Attack of the Clones what makes it below the Last Jedi is the fact that watching the movie entirely raises more questions than it answers, and some deleted scenes are what answer some of those questions."
1,"In the episode ""This Side of Paradise"" we meet Spock's ex-girlfriend a human named Leila.  In the episode it is explained that Spock basically broke up with her for career reasons (the same reason Kirk normally breaks up with his exs).  However I think that the torment that he went through as a kid for only being half-Vulcan which prevented him from being at home with either group.  (Until at least he finds his home on the Enterprise.)  I think that Spock thought the idea of perhaps having children who would be even less Vulcan was repugnant to him despite his feelings for Leila.  Then again  maybe he was just feeling guilty for cheating on T'Pring. I hope he didn't feel that guilty.

If you would like to read my full review of This Side of Paradise you can do so here:  [https://jeremysstartrekreviews.blogspot.com/2020/02/plants-that-spit-on-you-and-make-you.html](https://jeremysstartrekreviews.blogspot.com/2020/02/plants-that-spit-on-you-and-make-you.html)"
1,"I didn't grow up with Star Trek at all, but always thought it would resonate with me. Last year, I started with TOS and it was everything I thought it would be. Since then, I watched TNG, which I immediately loved even more. After that, I went on to DS9, which was a bit different, but I now love more than TNG even. Now, 2.5 seasons into DS9, I'm starting VOY since that's when they aired and I like the idea of switching back and forth (seeing what's going on in the Delta quadrant and then what's going on back on Bajor).

All that said, I'm having trouble ""getting"" Janeway. I'm about 10 episodes in and I never know what to expect from her, and she seems to fluctuate wildly between being badass and confident and being overly worried by what seems to be the most minor issue. Sometimes, I almost feel like the writers are relying on her facial expressions to convey the severity of the situation when they can't figure out another way to do so.

In the past couple of episodes, I've started to realize that she's a lot more like Kirk than she is like Picard. I think I sort of felt the same way about him sometimes. And that makes sense since the types of missions the Voyager is on seem a lot more like TOS's missions of exploration than TNG's various missions spanning diplomacy, war, exploration, etc. Nevertheless, I feel like I still don't understand her value system or motivations or something.

Like I said, I'm only 10 episodes in, so maybe I just need to give it more time, but if anyone has any thoughts they'd like to contribute that might help me understand her motivations better, I'd appreciate it! I looked around a bit online and someone said that her guilt at stranding her crew in Delta quadrant was a chief motivator for her actions, so I'll be keeping that in mind. Just looking for other opinions. Thanks!"

At first I thought she was Han and Leia's kid or something then it came out it was Ben/Kylo so I thought that that was where it was going.

0,"(This has a similar theme as part 1, but covers different content.)

One of the biggest issues with the sequel trilogy is what seems like the fall of a protagonist - especially after having built him up decades ago and the character has been in people's minds for about 40 years now. 

BUT Luke's ""regret"" of trying to assassinate Ben in his sleep could've been after Ben killed Mara Jade. It can be rationalized that in the sequel trilogy, Ben has already fought in the Yuuzhan Vong War, turned to the dark side, tried to seduce \*ahem\* ""Ben"", already killed off Mara Jade, already destroyed the Jedi temple, and now is at literal war with the new republic. 

Rey's character, however, could've only been better if Palpatine would've been re-introduced as a clone in the beginning of season 7 and as Rey's grandfather. Then Rey would've had more depth, purpose, and rationale for fighting against a seasoned force user like Ben. Otherwise, that was just lazy writing. 

The other missing kids from the Skywalker/Solo family could've been busy? Kinda like how they played with Ahsoka's character and rationalized how she wasn't in any of the movies. 

I feel the damage, but I feel like it can be worked with. It's not as dramatic as directly ignoring everything from the previous movies and canon, so I think there's still hope for reconciliation, especially with Filoni and Favreau manning the helm.

Thoughts?"

1,"So long story short my in-laws passed away in a tragic house fire. And they left behind quite the haul of star trek memorabilia EG toys,cards,signed plaques,signed in character headshots, and so on and so forth.

0,"For characters like Anakin, Obi-wan, Padmé, and Yoda, they’ve all been voiced by the same actors for years in many forms of media. 

For characters like Luke, Leia, and Han, Star Wars seems to just choose a new actor for almost every voice appearance. 

Using Leia as an example, she’s voiced by different actresses in Battlefront, Forces of Destiny, and Rebels. Anakin, who also appears in all three of those titles, is voiced by Matt Lanter all throughout. Luke is also voiced by different actors in Battlefront 2015, Battlefront 2017, and Forces of Destiny (Mark Hamill). Even Vader has three different canon voices between Rebels, Battlefront, and Fallen Order. 

All I can think is that the characters with recurring voice actors are primarily former members of the clone wars cast. It still seems really strange to me that for characters who didn’t appear in clone wars, Star Wars doesn’t seem to care about finding one actor to voice a character long term. I appreciate bringing the clone wars cast back as those voices are so attached to the characters now, but I’d also like if they found one primary voice for other characters."
0,"Hello everyone,

After almost 30 years of life I finally got around to watch all of the movies. I used to talk smack to one of my childhood friends about how he was a nerd due to his liking of Star Wars. I initially started watching the Mandalorian and got hooked. It wasnt until I watched the 2nd season and that last episode got me. This badass dude flys in and........ I dont want to spoil it. 2 months ago I watched the movies from Episode 1 all the way to the 9nth movie. Then I watched them again. I also watched Rogue one and The Solo movie. I am currently watching the clone wars Ahsoka is badass. 

The purpose of this post is to see if you guys can guide me in the right direction. I want to start from the beginning. I want to know about the Big Bang and go forward. I want to read books, comics in order from the start.


I have a bunch of action figures already. Luke Skywalker, foot tall Darth Vader(My favorite) Kylo Ren, Sith Stormtrooper and more.

0,"In the GFFA space is much like an ocean with nebulas acting as reefs hiding mysterious creatures, asteroids acting as homes to mynocks and exogorths and   home to monsters of the deep. 

The GFFA is home to an interesting and diverse number of interstellar fauna and creatures that would easily fit under the kaiju tag in any holodrama. So today lets take a look at some of the kaiju in the New EU!

With 25 Kaiju and growing (and this is without the base Exogorth, Sarlaac, Krayt Dragon, or Rancor) I'm only really going to talk about 12 in depth before mentioning those who don't have that much of a background other than being big, scary, and more often than not very angry.

So the first one is the first kaiju to appear in the NEU was a [large glowing winged humanoid creature](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_Cr%C3%A8che_creature) that lived on the planet of Ovanis. For centuries the creatures egg was worshiped by a cult on the planet until a year before the the Hosnian Cataclysim when the egg hatched and attacked those around it. A black version of the same species soon appeared and the [two creatures fought in the air](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/84/Ovanis_saviours_fight.png/revision/latest?cb=20161114073745) with both fists and energy beams projected from their mouths.

The second kaiju to appear in the NEU may have possibly been the [flying whale ships](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Whale-ship) that were large enough to house entire skyscrapers on their backs and transport people through hyperspace. Darth Vader even used the giant creatures to assault his own super star destroyer when Cylo had taken control of it.

In fact Vader has encountered a number of kaiju in his service of his master. The planet of Cianap had been destroyed by a monster known as [Ender](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ender), a huge 20 story monster which a very shark like body and arrow like head. Vader was able to defeat the monster after a long and hard fought battle. 

More recently Vader had a run in with an [unkown squid like creature](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_creature_\(Red_Honeycomb_Zone\)) on his journey to Exegol. Possessing a giant eye over a vertical chasm of teeth the unknown creature acts as the guardian of the path to the lost sith planet attacking with its dozen limbs as well as through the force.

It is possible this creature could be of some relation to the [Summa-Verminoth](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Summa-verminoth), a giant tentacled creature that lives in the gravity wells of the malestrom around Kessel. Much like a stellar version of the sarlacc this monster grabs on to passing ships and pulls them down into the gravity well where it devoured its catch

Not all kaiju found in the depths of space were dangerous to ships or out to make of meal of any passerby. Some like the [interdimensional jelly fish](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/h3IqI8XsMcAfCkAPrcTFQb-30owgrkr803Y1FrrO83H1sgPSblpQ37JeuSAFs01YAJR83pB24FGh=s1600) near the Dragon Run or the [large space crab](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_creature_\(Kankalo_Belt_Containment_Zone\))  in the Kankalo Belt Containment Zone were only dangerous to those who invaded their home territory. And some like the purgill that [could grow up to a third the size of a Imperial Star Destroyer](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/011/005/516/4k/luke-harrington-purrgilultraava-06001-2.jpg?1527369988) or the [neebray](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Neebray) which had an average wingspan longer than the length of a Star Destroyer could actually be helpful to travelers. 

Some creatures were even mistaken for celestial bodies like the giant Kakran that was confused for a planet called [K43](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/K43) because of the shell created around it while it slept

Back on the ground the planets of the GFFA were also home to a number of larger creatures capable of great destruction and held in equal parts fear and awe of those who lived with them and occasionally used for as mounts for the native people such as the [hammer-headed beasts of Carnelion IV](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hammer-headed_beast) or as a source of their power and magic such as the ancient and powerful [Sleeper](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sleeper) which slumbered in the waters under Mother Talzin's coven and that produced the ichor the witches used to enhance their magics.

The primative R'ora, a race of fish-like aliens with sharp features, shark like teeth, and a hunger for flesh, used the gigantic [Tsw'ell](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tsw%27ells) to attack and destroy the settelments of the other species that had moved to Luporoa. As the sea levels rose it allowed the giant tentacled monsters with pink skin, numerous tentacles, sharp teeth, and two eyes. to march further and further inland. 

Not everything that came from the sea was out to attack unfortunate sailors or those who decided to take a short cut through a planets core. On Castilon a species of large green six eyed creatures that looked like a mix between a whale and a octopus were known to be peaceful when left along. The [Rokkna](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rokkna) were able to grow up to over 220 meters in length. 

High above the oceans the clear air was also home to its own set of kaiju. Creatures that could grow larger than even the [thranta](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thranta) of Alderaan or the [Beldon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Beldon) of Bespin. 

On Dathomir large winged bats known as [chirodactyl](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chirodactyl) were notorous among the people of Dathomir for attacking unwary travelers. Liking to live in dark caves the chirodactyl was known to drop its prey from great heights to make sure it was dead before eating it. 

On Celsor 3 a large air manta known as a [jakoosk](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jakoosk) were occasionally hunted for their meat. The jakoosk were a species of large creatures capable of flying and burrowing under snow native to the ice moon Celsor 3. They had thick gray skin and large mouths filled with large teeth that made hunting them even in starfighters very dangerous.

On Kashyyk however the skies are much friendlier. The [shyyyo bird](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shyyyo_bird) was a rare species of massive blue-blooded bird native to the planet Kashyyyk. Sightings of shyyyo birds were extremely rare, and the creatures were once thought to be legends.Shyyyo birds were capable of gliding significant distances while using little energy due to their body shape and feathers. This efficiency meant that the average adult Shyyyo only needed to leave its nest to hunt once per week.

The surface worlds were also not short on their share of oversized creatures. Larger than the well known rancor favored by the witches of dathomir and Hut crime lords the [jungle rancor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_rancor) had clearly defined shells and proportions resembling that of a turtle, with larger heads relative to the rest of their bodies. Orange and gray spines that ran along their bodies. Their unique physiology imbued them with greater speed and a keener sense of smell than other rancor subspecies.

Just like the jungle rancors are cousins to the better known dathomir rancor the sarlacc also has a cousin. [The Ibdis Maw](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ibdis_Maw) can be found on the planet Bracca and unlike their carnivorous cousins the ibdis maw feeds on metal scraps from the junkyards. Its large tentacles pulling down entire train cars and small ships with ease. The Maw in fact is one large creature that consisted of a number of mouths connected by a vast digestive system located hundreds of meters below the surface of the planet.

On the theme of larger cousins I would be remiss if I didn't mention the [Greater Krayt Dragon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Greater_krayt_dragon). Unlike its more traditionally draconic cousin the Greater Krayt more resembles a serpent with a dozen finned legs that it uses to swim under the surface of the dune sea hunting for bantha and other animals. While possessing the coveted kryat dragon pearl like their cousin the Greater dragon also had a acid sack that allowed it to spew corrosive acid at any attackers.
 
Everyone is most likely familiar with the [Zillo Beast](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zillo_Beast) that was discovered on Malastare and was transported to Coruscant where it caused mayhem until being brought down. While originally being thought to be native to Malastare the existence of a zillo beast on Benathy as well as Palpatine's interest in it raises the possibility that the zillo beast could be one of the number of Sith warbeasts that were created in the hundred-years darkness and other sith wars. 

Much like the zillo beast the [Tirra'Taka](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tirra%27Taka) slumbered underground beneath the capital city of the planet Serenno. Possibly a type of [leviathan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leviathan_\(creature\)) the tirra'taka was a large reptellian dragon that the sith used to conquer the planet until the locals rose up and sealed it away underground until Dooku awoke it and used it to dethrone his brother. 

Other lesser known kaiju were the [Carnellian Dragons](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Carnelian_dragon) of Carnelion IV and the large  predatory beasts with curved horns, long tails, and thick skin known as [roggwarts](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Roggwart) that lived on Mustafar. Mustafar was also home to the [Darkghast](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darkghast) which lived below Vader's castle. 

And for now that is basically it when it comes to the kaiju of the NEU. Their are other large creatures not mentioned here but I'm unsure if they would count as kaiju. I'm sure in the coming months and years we will continue to add to this number as it seems the NEU really likes creatures living in space and its large space monsters."

1,"Just watched an episode of Star Trek: Enterprise where they find some Borg frozen in the Arctic and defrost them because they don’t know what they are and the Borg assimilate 4 people and leave Earth and eventually the enterprise, under Captain Archer destroys their Borg ship. The captain discovers that those Borg were frozen for around a 100 years, which places them on earth when Picard visited there in 2063 when Zefram Cochran tested the first warp engine and Picard came back in time to fight the Borg. Unfortunately the Borg manage to send a sub-space signal off before they’re destroyed by Archer. The doctor of enterprise says that the Sub-space signal will take around 200 years to reach the Delta quadrant where it was sent to and he says that they’ve just delayed a Borg invasion by about 200 years, which takes you up to the era when Picard first meets the Borg. So basically those Borg and Picard created a paradox. If Picard had destroyed all Borg in 2063 then they couldn’t have sent a signal back in Captain Archers time to the Borg in the Delta Quadrant so they wouldn’t have come to earth in the first place!"

I have a few ideas for interconnected shows.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starfleet Academy**

I honestly have no idea how this one hasn't happened yet. It's pretty much a no-brainer, there's not much to explain here, except using previously established characters as some of the professors (and connective tissue to the prime universe: think O'Brien, Nurse Ogawa, and more) the idea of spinning off graduates/interns/cadets into ensemble roles in other shows. The cast should be somewhat fluid, especially as far as the faculty is concerned, bringing in guest lecturers who aren't necessarily permanent faculty, or some teachers only being temporarily assigned and possibly moving to other spinoffs as time goes on. Overall, I'd like Trek to explore the idea more that in a pseudo-military organization like Starfleet, people would move around a lot, instead of staying in the same post for seven years because an episodic business model demands it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starfleet Medical**

Another no-brainer. Think House meets Grey's Anatomy in space(ish). Starfleet Medical bigwigs like Crusher and Pulaski could have anything from cameos to major recurring roles. I, for one, think it would be fun to see these two interact, and more importantly, give Crusher more to do and more personality than TNG gave her. Students from the Academy series could show up as new graduates or as cadet/interns.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starfleet Corps of Engineers**

Same as the above, as far as Academy and prime timeline connective tissue goes, only here, expect the likes of O'Brien, LaForre, Torres, etc. Again, the legacy characters could be anything from cameos to major recurring roles, as the plot demands. Overall, as in all of these, I'd push the ensemble model as far as possible. Both the medical and engineering shows could mainly be procedurals with arcs, focusing on the biggest problems of the week in their respective fields. Maybe we could even see why O'Brien is the most important person in Starfleet.

&amp;#x200B;

Show me what you got."

The topic is dealt with much better with ""Up the Long Ladder"" (TNG S2E18). I realize it gets expensive to hire 200 extras and costume them. But at least throw a line in about tying in all the transporters to move X number of people all at once. Or am I the only one bothered by this?"

And then id have the series be set in motion by some kind of mission that requires a klingon crew to take on a federation officer and theres some kind of mystery which ties the whole series together.

My question is did the other dead jedi beside him forgive him for all that he did? I mean the dude helped murder billions. He also enslaved a lot of people too and murdered the children those jedi were raising with his own lightsaber. Did they really just get over that in a matter of days since he *killed* Palpatine?

1,"So I am aware there was sort of Federation Origin series called Star Trek: Enterprise, though I think that more focused on early Enterprise adventures rather than the politics, which is fine obviously space exploration is more appealing and certainly this origin series i want should have that too. I feel like though that maybe we should get an actual Federation Origin series that doesn't end in a hologram simulation (yeah the final episode Enterprise got negative reviews and was cancelled). Maybe it could be a soft reboot of Enterprise or a full-on reboot with a recast Archer. I don't know how this would be accomplished but I personally would want to see the political machininations that led to the formation of the Federation. What about you guys?"

It’s always bugged me because it could make sense like in Legends they were artificial and in new canon they’re just bled kyber crystals I think they could’ve just kept both right?

Like say prior to the Jedi Purge, the Jedi were keeping a close eye on where the Sith got their natural red kyber crystals from which caused them to make artificial ones but after Order 66 they gained access to natural crystals again, that could’ve worked right? Am I the only one who thinks this?"

Eps. 1-3 were off-putting to me only because I thought they looked so different visually. Other than that I'm curious what it was about the stories that people didn't like. Were there plot holes? Did Jar Jar really make a huge impact? Was it that 7-9 were similar to 4-6? Even I thought that was a little on the nose, but I still enjoyed watching them all. I guess I wish I had the drive to read the books, or at least start Clone Wars. I could also pay thorough attention, and even learn less prominent characters names. If I had to guess, it seems to me that 1-3, and 7-9 had a lot more going on, and it seemed a little hectic, which maybe took away from dialog."

1,"Klingons are brutal and violent, and have an innate lust for blood and conquest. They can't be satiated, its ""bred in the bone"". They even revel in this stereotypical view of themselves for the pleasure of the viewer.  


Ferengi are a race of duplicitious, misognyistic, grubbers. They have an ugly caricature appearance that reminds one of the racist Jew stereotypes of exceedingly ugly people with mis-sized ears and noses, who care only for profit and sell everyone else down the river for it. Its so blindingly obviously derivative of real stereotypes.  


All the women from TOS to TNG are written like this: They are demure and second-place to the men around them, and even if men violate their personal space, they still forgive them and work with them, as unrealistic as any of this is, by being upset about it at one moment and completely giving up on those feelings the next. As if women worked that way in real life.  


Romulans remind me of the caricature of China right now: A race which is aggressive and sneaky, paranoid and wants to rule everything.  


The only ""evolved"" race in the galaxy is basically human. That human exceptionalism. Reads a lot like the Great American Imperialist thinking that everywhere else is barbarian in comparison and ""we graciously tolerate the genetically derived stereotypically shortcomings of other races to prove our wonderful level of tolerance."".

0,"This has probably already crossed the minds of some of you but it just occurred to me...

When Jedha is destroyed, it fundamentally alters the rebellion in many ways.

First, the destruction leads to the death of not only Saw Gerrera but his entire rebel cell. Up until this point (and not just in RO), it’s been made clear that Gerrera is an extremist to the point that he gives the rebellion a bad reputation in some corners of the galaxy. When Jedha is destroyed, Gerrera doesn’t even try to escape. He’s accepted that the rebellion will be better off if it moves on from him and his group with people like Jyn and her friends being the new lifeblood of the Rebellion, knowing that the destruction of Jedha - him along with it - will be a better recruiting tool for the Rebellion than he could have accomplished in 50 lifetimes. 

When the Rebellion learns of the destruction of Jedha, it breathes new life and courage into its ranks, with a couple dozen rebels volunteering to help Jyn get the Death Star plans. Cassian makes a point that he, along with these volunteers, have all done bad things for the Rebellion, stating that those joining the Rogue One mission include, among other things, assassins for the rebellion. So invigorated are these rebels we can hear shouts of “for Jedha!” as they attack Scarif. At the end of the film, our deeply flawed heroes (the criminal/former extremist Jyn Erso, the assassin Cassian Andor, the cynical Baze Malbus, the former imperial droid K2SO) wiped out, seamlessly transitioning from the scruffy ragtag flawed heroes to the uniformed rebel soldiers and the (lack of better word) “pure” Princess Leia. All the characters who were in need of redemption get it. It’s almost a shame that Chirrut wasn’t a more flawed (in that sense) character as it could give the story a more “clean symmetry”, though his death was inevitable with the death of Baze anyway. 

This leaves the Rebellion in many ways born anew at the end of Rogue One, leading into the more for again lack of better word “pure” Rebellion that follows the lead of the likes of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia. Even the main droid switches from an Imperial protocol droid to a former Republic protocol droid and astromech. 

This was genuinely a well written and well thought out story (if that’s indeed what the writers were going for)."

Excited to hear y'alls thoughts and opinions!

----------------------

Knowing that Enterprise marked the end of 18 years of continuous Star Trek, I had my skepticisms on the show's quality. I was happily proven wrong and found myself loving Phlox's informal therapy sessions, Trip's sarcastic banter, T'Pol's infinite perplexities at the pink skins. By the end of the third season I felt invested – these characters had made an impact. After all, the NX-01 is arguably the most important starship in the history of the Federation. Its place in history deserved a send off equal to that of the ship's notoriety. Instead, we got ""These are the Voyages"". 

**The Berman and Braga Maneuver**

After contributing over six-hundred hours of Star Trek, the duo had one final job before retiring once and for all to Risa.  It was an impossible task. They had to send off a beloved franchise that had influenced multiple generations and captivated hundreds of millions of people. More specifically, they were saying goodbye to the starship. Production and development of the series finale paints a vivid picture plagued by Paramount oversight, miscommunication amongst cast, and journalistic criticism. 

Paramount was reluctant to admit they had plans to cancel the struggling series. Their judgement misguided by larger ambitions of the Ferengi variety – profit. As the third season was wrapping up production, Paramount believed they would more easily sell syndication if Enterprise was 96 episodes instead of 74. This was their primary motive in renewing for a fourth season. Despite knowing their intentions to cancel the show, they waited to announce until syndication was officially sold. The cast became aware near the end of production for season four. Attention quickly focused upon the show’s send off in their final episode.

Cast members began deliberating on what would be an appropriate and fitting send off for the series. Connor Trinneer, who plays Trip Tucker, later commented “I wanted us all to have the big M*A*S*H moment — the really memorable farewell” ([TV Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20080210083618/http://www.tvguide.com/news/trek-enterprise-finale/050523-05)). The show’s producers had a different idea in mind. In fact, they had an entirely separate show for the finale. They had a vision to create a new episode of The Next Generation that reflected upon the final days of the NX-01 crew.

To Berman and Braga’s credit, this episode had always been planned as the fourth season’s finale. Through unfortunate circumstances, it became the entire franchise’s send off. The producers adjusted the script to have a greater emphasis on nostalgia and fanfare in an attempt to match the final episode’s status. When all was said and done, “These are the Voyages…” came into creation.

**Have a Nice Trip**

My favorite character from the crew of Enterprise is Commander Trip Tucker. His sarcasm and relaxed demeanor brought a sense of normalcy to this grand sci-fi adventure. As the show grew, he became one of the most important officers in Starfleet. I was not alone in these sentiments, because the show’s producers had big plans for Trip in the series finale. Namely, they wanted to kill him off.

There is simply no benefit of the doubt here. Trip’s death was rushed, handled poorly, and an insult to Trinneer’s phenomenal work. In less than five minutes the show transitions from peaceful and nostalgic reflections to four gunmen “storming” Enterprise. Going against all of Trip’s character development, he decides to disobey orders and trick the gunmen into a trap – which consequently kills Trip as well.

At face value, Trip would be the type of person who sacrifices themselves for the greater good. It is the hastily scripted, rushed death that ruins this moment for fans of the show. To add fuel to the fire, unneeded guests Riker and Troi casually foreshadow Trip’s demise throughout the entirety of the episode. More time is spent building suspense and intrigue than on the character’s actual death.

The commander’s death is used as a point of intrigue by Riker. A means of solving his own personal struggles with morality. This structure detaches viewers from caring about a character they have grown to love over the past four years. Unfortunately, Trip was not the only Starfleet officer caught in the crossfire of this rushed finale.

**The Human Vulcan**

The episode placed heavy focus on emotion and nostalgia. Two things which do not meld (pun intended) with Vulcans. Instead of investing time and energy into developing a coherent conclusion to T’Pol’s character, the producers of the show decided to simply make her human. The result being an emotional, caring, and thoughtful individual that in no way fits the canonical definitions of Vulcan.

In all honesty, this is a problem that developed slowly throughout the shows life. T’Pol was used for everything from sex appeal, to love interest, and even a slave. In order to achieve these things, the shows producers disregarded her vulcanism and relied upon a rather lazy aspect of the Vulcan species. That being the fact that Vulcans do have emotions, they simply train themselves to forgo them in favor of logic.

T’Pol is particularly affected by Trip’s death in this episode. Wait, sorry – that actually does not happen. Despite Riker awkwardly interrogating the Vulcan about her past relationship with Trip, T’Pol spends a few minutes discussing her desires to meet his parents and that is it. I interpret this lack of response as being indicative of the writer’s attempting to make her Vulcan. Their efforts are futile in comparison to Spock’s encounters with death throughout the franchise and are inconsistent with their handling of the character elsewhere.

These short comings painfully culminate in the show’s finale. Nowhere is a Vulcan to be found. Blalock was passionate about portraying this species, and has publicly spoken about her disappointment in how the character was handled.

**Archer's Not So Glorious Speech**

The show ends on a high note of Captain Archer giving his famous speech that marks the early foundations of what would become the Federation. An auditorium filled with thousands upon thousands of individuals from over 15 worlds are in attendance. A speech so monumental, children are taught to memorize it in grade school. It is the perfect sendoff to an important crew, a beloved franchise, and the NX-01.

Except the show’s producers decided to have none of that. Once again, the cast of Enterprise is set aside in favor of Riker and Troi’s story. The way this scene is handled is almost condescending to fans. The Next Generation cast banter about how important this speech is to their history. Troi asks of Riker, “Or do you need to hear the speech again?” At this point fans are angrily screaming at Picard’s first officer to let the holodeck continue. Instead, he ends transmission. Thus queueing the ending of the episode, which features a montage of Kirk, Picard, and Archer uttering the famous words of The Original Series’ opening.

This set of events can only be described as a blatant bait and switch by the producers. Would lifelong Star Trek fans prefer to hear the very speech that gave birth to the federation, or have a lazy fanfare montage that adds nothing to the franchise? The answer is obvious yet we were refused such a monumental moment.

**All Good Things**

This episode marks a disappointing end to a show that remains critically underrated. It marked the conclusion of nearly two decades of Star Trek, and the last episode of the franchise for twelve years. Canonically, fans consider the episode before it to be the official send off of Enterprise. It is often ranked amongst the ten worst episodes of the entire franchise, but none held a more significant promise than that of “These are the Voyages…”"

0,"Our debate teacher is letting us do some fun debates to screw around, so my partner and I picked Mando vs Boba Fett. We flipped a coin for it, and ended up with me arguing for Mando, and him arguing for Boba.

What are some good arguments to make for this? (Either in favor of Mando, or something my opponent might say).

So far, I've got:

* Mando is younger and fitter, while Boba is still injured from the Sarlack
* B/C of Beskar armor, it's almost guaranteed that the fight will be decided in melee combat, where Mando has the edge because of his spear, as well as the Darksaber.
* Boba Fett got taken out easily by a blind guy with a blunt stick, so a trained guy with a pointy stick should be able to win easily
* Sex appeal: Pedro Pascal wins.

1,"I don't know if this has been discussed already. I'm new, but he leaves her for a career opportunity, ends up on the same ship, continues to see other women until finally one day deciding to actually be with her. Obviously, Deanna agreed to the marriage but I think she could do better. It must be said that I love Riker and think he's a great person, but he doesn't seem to be the best romantic partner (long term I mean). Anyone agree or disagree?"
1,"The easiest way to start the notion of this is by reframing the [Epicurean paradox:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Epicurus)

Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.  
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?  
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? 

The first example:

Imagine a species like us... roughly similar IQs, but a few centuries of technology ahead. Imagine them watching us from a starship in 2021, parked in orbit around our planet but using their technology to prevent us from seeing them.

Imagine knowing that they have the medical technology to have come up with not only an effective treatment for COVID in a day, but a one shot vaccine to boot. And they sit there and watch. 

Who are they to sit there and not intervene as millions of sentient lives are snuffed out - often in agony - as their loved ones are forced to say goodbye over a remote viewscreen? Who are they to let an \*entire species\* suffer the mental health degradation brought on by a year of isolation? Who are they to say ""well, they haven't developed replicator technology yet, so I guess we can just let those less well off financially (remember when we were like that guys? lol) put their lives at risk preparing food and delivering it to the wealthier folks""

It would damn well be unconscionable and unjustifiable in the extreme. You might as well look at a six year old child with an ugly infection and say ""Well, she hasn't invented antibiotics, so we might as well let this progress to sepsis.""

The notion that a species of sentient beings need to suffer the right amount and make it through the other side is even more horrifying. It's a sort of patronizing arrogance that says ""If I suffered, you need to suffer too, never mind the fact that I never really suffered, but I definitely have historical records that say my ancestors suffered.""

There are terrible, horrifying implications there. Consider the second example:

Imagine being in the Federation as it is written, and imagine observing a planet that has hit a level of technology that clearly implies (I mean, you've been an observer of many species by now that hit this point) that they are going to eventually hit warp drive technology. They're every bit as smart as humans, just five hundred years back on the tech curve. Airplanes, sent a rocket to their moon, etc.

They are facing some sort of Great Filter level disaster. Maybe they didn't get climate change figured out fast enough, because they're a bit closer to their sun or their atmosphere had just a bit more CO2 to begin with than ours did. By the time they realize they have a problem, they're already headed to an irrecoverable accelerating cycle that will turn their planet into a Venus-like hotbox.

Do you let them all die? Along with their culture, their hopes, their dreams, and their aspirations?

What if most of the species is peaceful and even advocating for the sort of ""enlightened humanism"" of the Federation but the planet contains one warlike culture that's going to dominate and eradicate them? Like ""if the Nazis had won"" kind of a thing. Could you let such a Holocaust occur if you had the power to prevent it? Could you condemn an entire species of sentient beings for the actions of a small number?

The answer to that one is so obvious that it's addressed by the ancient Jews in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Consider, even, a third example, somewhat different from the other two:

Imagine coming across a planet where there is a species of clearly sentient Cro-Magnon like beings that have covered their planet and are just now settling down into agriculture in small pockets around their globe. You've looked into them and they are roughly the same as us in terms of intelligence.

How do you \*not\* interfere and accelerate their progress? Why sit back and let them discover slavery, suffer through their Genghis Khans and their Black Plagues and their racist imperial periods? You've already found a better way, and you know damn well that left to their own they might turn into something like The Borg or The Cardassians or who knows what else.

Even if you don't want to come down as conquering aliens and super mindfuck them, go scoop up a few thousand of them, take them off planet, and introduce them to the federation. It's absolutely absurd to believe that the vast majority of them wouldn't get the picture pretty quickly. Let a generation of them live as at-large members of the Federation, and then have them go back down to their planet, set up some high tech bases, and let them teach their own bloody species everything they've learned.

And before you say this third example smacks of the exact cultural arrogance that the Prime Directive exists to prevent, allow me to issue two points in rebuttal:

1. The notion that the Federation believes that all cultures are of equal value is at best them talking out of both sides of their mouth. They judge new spacefaring species all the time and make the decision about whether they are ""worthy"" of joining the Federation. That implies that the Federation does, in fact, believe that their culture is superior and that other species would be better off joining them in their brotherhood of species.
2. The very notion that all cultures are created equal smacks of the worst kind of western absurdism. It's the kind of notion you can only hold dear to your heart if you are willing to stand by and let any amount of human rights atrocities occur without raising your voice and saying it's wrong. You can't say all cultures are created equal and then turn around and complain about Blood Diamonds. You get one or the other, you can't have both.

Anyway, just thinking lately about how our species might actually fuck ourselves up to the point where we don't make it out into space, and it got me to thinking about how severely I would judge an alien species that was watching us and ""waiting for us to mature."" 

It's racism at its worst to judge humanity by the concentration camps in China, or the anti-science nuttery that's made its way through social media lately. In conclusion, I hereby declare independence from the Federation and I'm going to make my own Federation, with blackjack and hookers."
1,"So I been reading a lot mostly at work.  Something to do during lunch, and oftentimes I unload truckloads of gas/oil into large tanks or railcars and after running hoses and setting up, all I do is sit there for an hour babysitting a running pump and keeping an eye on making sure hoses don't come loose and pop off.  Good opportunity to get some reading done, and I do.

Been digging a lot of scifi, but Star Trek in particular has become a thing since I have been re-watching all of the shows and movies in order again starting with TOS last summer and I'm up to Voyager and all the movies now.  Just Enterprise and the newest ones to go after this, but I deviate from the point of my question.

So I've read the new Picard books, the ones detailing Picard's time as an Admiral during the Romulan crisis, and the following one that details Riker and Troi on the Titan.  I read Prime Directive which was pretty a pretty damn good Kirk era novel.  And now I'm reading Federation, which somehow connects Kirk, Picard, and Zephram Cochran in a way I haven't read far enough yet to figure out.  Seems to be a favorite among fans even if the canonity of it was invalidated when Star Trek: First Contact had Zephram Cochran as a character in it.

 1st off anyone can add action music and make my adrenalin pump, it ant skill, and it's sorta dull if you want to watch an exploration show with some action.   
 That is all-star trek is, is an action show, with sci-fi elements. I am five eps in, and that's all it wants to give me, is a blood-thumping time.  
 we get mushroom people, and all that fat bitch wants to do is run from it, that's all the crew wants to do with it.   
 Clearly, it needs to talk to them, yet what do they do? yank it out of her, past captains and crew would have spent time talking, but no.

0,It’s like the title says. I’m a big fan of these characters and games and shows there in but I strongly feel like they should not survive the inquisitor period.

I also think that it makes the empire look much weaker as even at the height of their power they still we’re getting there ass handed to them by like 4 Jedi. Thoughts?

1,"I have recently entered a “Star Trek-Phase” again. For me, my personal interests seem to rotate between a few subjects I like a lot, and sometimes a new subjects gets added to that rotation. 

Many years ago, when I went to live in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, on an exchange year and a half to improve my English, I started watching Star Trek. Before long, I had binged every series, bar TAS and TOS. Since then, I have been in love with the franchise. I like TNG and DS9 best, but also really enjoy VOY and ENT. 

I enjoyed Picard and Discovery, but they were missing something all other Star Trek shows had. 

A few months ago, I rewatched ENT in its entirety and had a blast. Then I moved on to VOY, and also really enjoyed it, though I didn’t finish season 7. I then started a watch-through of DS9, because it is one of my favourite series. However, a few episodes into season 2, I realised that I still remember every episode. It’s not time for a rewatch yet. And thus, I have begun a rewatch of TNG. I intend to watch every episode again. I just watched “Encounter at Farpoint”, and WOW! There’s a lot to work through! 

At first I thought “Hey, some of the women wear skirts. Seems like we’re not yet that woke. Then I realised there were also a few men wearing skirts and I thought that was really funny! 

I completely forgot the plot of this episode, so I’m looking forward to the other episodes I forgot. Picard was kind of a dick in the first half of the two-parter. Generally, the first half of the two-parter was weird. Troi was way over-sensitive to emotions, Tasha was like a bouncer, Picard was a dick, Riker was the swot you laughed at in school and Data was way more robot than usual. 

However, after watching season one of DS9, four seasons of ENT and six and a half seasons of VOY recently, wow, this is different. You start, and you get this new captain on a luxurious ship, and all of a sudden, Q pops up and puts humanity on trial. What a start to this series. I love it! 

I’m looking forward to the rest of it. It was definitely time for a rewatch :)"
1,"I’m not in the middle of doing yet another TNG thing, but I was watching one of those vertical channels on one of the streaming channels and there was a Star Trek one on there. I click on it and boom, I’m watching TNG reruns, just like it’s 1998 all over again. Commercials and everything. 

I usually kind of remember not digging episodes and movies that Center around kids but this time around I was like “Woah”. The big part that hit me was when Alexander was in art class working on his little art project, some weird Klingon thing for Worf. So Alexander is there doing his thing, when the ghost imaginary alien friend fucks with him and messed up his ashtray thing, and it kind of fucked with him in a significant way. Like in the episode it kind of displayed that he wasn’t being a weirdo Klingon kid, he was legit just doing his thing in school until he got fucked with inexplicably. TNG never fails to sneak little things in, long after the fact that I either didn’t get or had forgotten all about."

0,"Just interested in discussing this one. I hear/see this one a lot on reddit pointing to the biggest original trilogy plot hole. I really never understood the trench death star issue. Almost every machine in existence has a weakness, your car has a gas tank that can explode, airplanes, simple mechanical machinery, if you know how the machine works (have their diagrams/plans) you can figure out how to destroy it or disable it. 

While I loved Rogue One, I didn't see the necessity in creating a weakness for the death star. Like I said, machines have weaknesses, it's almost inevitable.. you just have to find them. I imagine rebel engineers had to pour over the death star plans and diagrams and figure out if there were indeed weaknesses and how to possibly exploit them. 

For example, you can stick a potato in some ones car exhaust pipe and fuck it up pretty badly. You could put a rag in the gas tank and light it on fire. Even tanks in warfare have weaknesses if some one gets close enough to it with a sticky grenade or can get a small bomb inside the tank.

You could think of the trench as some sort of exhaust port or something that eventually leads to a giant fuel source, it wasn't exactly an easy weakness to find and exploit and the torpedoes needed to be fired PERFECTLY so as to make it all the way to the center of the death star and reach the fuel source. As they explained in the movie, this just wasn't expected by the Empire, they didn't even realize the weakness was there or that a small one man fighter could even be a threat.

Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is full of plot holes but of all of them, this one makes the least sense to me. I just don't see the death star having a weakness as an issue, at least in ANH. 

What do you guys think?"

If CBS/Paramount really wants anything approaching an MCU-like experience, I totally believe it can be built in the prime Trek universe with the right creative choices and planning. 90s Trek is especially ripe for this with so many of the actors at the apex of their careers and probably even willing to return, with plenty of demand from the fanbase to boot. Who wouldn't want to see what happens next with The Doctor, Janeway, The Sisko, Jake Sisko, The Traveler AKA Wesley Crusher, Garak, Bashir, O'Brien, etc. There are so many opportunities for Paramount to produce its own Mandalorian here, it's practically money waiting to be printed."

The above title goes for many of the alien actors on various Treks, but I've always found Ethan's and Armin's performances of Neelix and Quark special in a way that no other actor of alien species could deliver as they did, if only because noone else the had the opportunity by the sheer number of times they were called upon to do so.

The above picture is a scene in S6E14 - Memorial, where he is suffering from PTSD, taken just before he lets Naomi go, whom he held as hostage up until then. It's all of 2 seconds long... His face first reveals an internal struggle as clear as daylight - between trusting a friend of many years or listening to his own self when every fiber of him is telling him that it's not safe to emerge from hiding, then it becomes set briefly into what I think of as Neelix's ""thousand yard stare"". 

The desperation, the tears on the verge of being shed, the fear, the almost maddening experience of being in a life &amp; death battle where so many die but surviving to continue on living, it's all there in his face in those 0,5 seconds that made it onto screen. Delivering it through a layer of cosmetics is nothing short of extraordinary acting in my opinion."
1,What would happen if you flew a ship into a planet at warp speed.  Would it destroy the planet?  Imagine if the bajoran resistance thought of this.  They could fly a ship into cardassia prime at warp.  And there goes the cardassian empire.  The resulting power vaccum would cause chaos for the cardassians.  Hopefully giving the resistance on bajor the upper hand.  I'm suprised that desperate people don't use tactics like this when they would clearly be effective.

Kate Mulgrew - Lovely lady, told her Voyager had got me through a serious depression patch and she said that she was glad to hear and was happy I was doing better.

Alexander Siddig - Didn't get to really talk to him but he also ended up putting his arm around me because I was very clearly an awkward and star struck mess, would love to have a conversation with him one day he seems chill

Anson Mount - Seemed a bit tired from well assumedly being at a convention but can't blame anyone really when you have to take god knows how many photos in an hour I dont blame you

George Takei - Ended up in the same restaurant as him, only realising when I stood up to go to the toilet to spit out a bit of uncheweable fat, he seemed like he was having a good time and didnt want to ruin it so I didnt say anything.

So far those are all the ones I've met, all lovely people considering the circumstances of a stressful convention, would love to re-meet some of them in a more natural environment someday!

1,"I grew up watching TNG in its original run.   I still remember in 87 watching Encounter at Farpoint in 87 with my mom and dad.  And the Enterprise D appeared.  It took my dad a normally very stiff man that doesn't curse at all to  say ""Look at all the f-bomb windows its f-bomb beautiful""    My words were ""Now thats the Enterprise""  It came on the local CBS station  thursdays at 7pm.  We had  rabbit  ears with tin foil.  

Earlier this  summer this beautiful 36"" Sony Trinitron Console TV showed up on FB marketplace.  Free  if you remove.  So i grabbed a couple buddies ,  and we went and got it,  loaded it my truck and got it home.   What a beast.    I finally had a reason to dig out my VCR and VHS collection again.     My dad wont let the TNG tapes go.   So i built an OSMC  Kodi player out of a Pi Zero I had laying around.   

Of course I had to put TNG on it for the first thing played to test it.  I have since put a ton of old shows i grew up with on it.  Knight Rider, The A-Team,  The Dukes Of Hazzard, Baywatch.   And a ton of 80s/90s cartoons.

Placing more importance in a lesson about hope rather than telling everyone the plan and raising morale seems like a bizarre thing to do as a military leader.

So my question for military people is: Is this something that would happen in real life? I would think the leaders would at least let their troops know a little of the plan. Otherwise morale drops and people defect. Im not tactically minded and have no military experience so Id like to hear from people who know. Then Ill know of my annoyance with Holdo is justified or not.

DS9 was a whole new concept for Star Trek in that there was no ship but a station, and it had a crew but it was mixed between Starfleet and not StarFleet. A whole new thing. 

Voyager even was a whole new thing, they leave DS9 and a space thing takes them what was it like 70k light years away. A whole new thing.

A month ago, inspired by the effort put by u/Empedokles123 into creating a complete transcript of the Jedi: Fallen Order game, i decided it was time to create a fan novelization everyone could enjoy. For that, I used Empedokles's [transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarscanon/comments/l7ur7n/fallen_order_complete_transcript_completed/) as a model for what is done today.

Finally, a month later, I completed the FIRST DRAFT of the 'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' fan novelization which is available here:

Hope you enjoy reading it (and this is only a first draft) as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Cheers and stay safe!"

how Sins of the Father should have ended.

Due to the attack on Kurn, currently a member of the Enterprise, they should have beamed down with 1 or 2 extra security officers.

Worf/Picard go to talk to Duras and K'mpek. After everything gets revealed Worf and Picard instead walk out, back to council chambers.

Worf stops and talks to Kurn and tells him what is revealed, and tells him to wait.

Worf reveals that it was Jarod who did the did, and says nothing else, and challenges Duras to a duel. 

Worf kills him.

Kurn then challenges K'mpek, for being old and weak, and the one who led the cover up. 

Kurn kills him, and takes the chancellor ship, with the backing of Worf head of the house of mogh. Noggra, Lorgh, and Kurns other friends in the KDF. Kurn orders that data of the captured romulan ship be released, along with asking Picard to release to all the Federation log of the attack, along with already existing kdf logs.

Worf remebers that Duras had no mate or male heirs, and request that the members of the House of Duras for their complicity be discommendated, and the House of Mogh instead only take their, and equipment, and ships.

The klingon civil war ways going to happen anyway, and now with the house of duras and their romulan allies, its much less worse."
0,"It just fascinates me what they did to produce those movies. The miniature models, to scale vehicles, and just a hint of cgi. I love how realistic and clean the new/oldish ones are. But looking at the snow speeder scene and trying to pick out the opacity of the overlay of the cockpit to see the atat through the window frame. Just shows how hard they tried to produce realistic visuals. (I think that's fixed in some of the newer re-releases) I mean some of the movies that came out back then we're so cheazy but star wars looks fantastic. Looks speeder actually looks like it hovers because they hid the wheels so well with crafty camera angles. Set designs and character attire. It's just so wild. Anyways thats all. Just saw the post of old photos and it got me thinking."

1,"I know Jeffrey Combs gets lots of admiration here for his multiple ST characters---and rightly so---but I just watched the VOY episode ""Revulsion"" last night and was reminded of what a great job Leland Orser has done on several different ST shows.  

I was reminded last night that some of my favorite moments with him in ST involve food:  in 'Revulsion', as a murderous hologram, he confronts B'elanna about how disgusting eating is from his perspective, what with the grinding of bits of plant and animal matter with teeth, using saliva to wash it down into the stomach, where stomach acids start to dissolve the remains---'so disgusting you humans can't even stand to think about it!'.  Creepy and menacing stuff.  And then in ENT, he plays the sleazy alien-collaborator in ""Carpenter Street"", where he insists on getting some fast food, much to the distaste of T'Pol.  IIRC, he even spills some of his burger or french fries on her, and she is unbelievably disgusted and uncomfortable.  I know he shows up in DS9 too.  So, for me at least, Mr. Orser has two great scenes about food in ST, with him playing diametrically opposed attitudes towards it.  Good stuff!"

0,"So I finished TCW 2-3 weeks ago and i decided to watch Rebels so I watched rebels for the first time now. So I divided this post into 2 parts: About Rebels and my questions and What to do next  
(ye I finished Rebels in 2-3 weeks)  


About Rebels and my questions:

 So as I said I just finished watching Rebels. I'm feeling kinda emotional rn I really liked the last 5 episodes and how Kanan sacrificed himself for the others and everyone was broken especially Ezra without his Master but yet he still found his way, I like the World between worlds episode too. The only 2 times I teared up in the series was when Ezra found out his parents were dead and in the epilogue when they told everyone's story after the OT especially how Zeb showed Kallus that he did not destroy the Lasat cuz Kallus probably felt bad after killing the Lasat but now he has a chance to redeem himself. And how Hera and Kanan had a child, so sad that Kanan cannot see his son and raise him. But my question is about Ezra, what happened to him? We see that Sabine only realized after few years she needs to rescue him. And what did Ahsoka do for so much time after Ezra saved her? She could have stopped Kanan from dying and helped the Crew back on Lothal. Are there any comics that connect to Rebels and answer my questions, and can any of you fill me in?   


What to do next:  
Idk what to do next cuz I watched all Star Wars content except: Vintage content, Resistance and Lego Stuff. I plan to do that one time but not now cuz I heard Resistance is bad + no force-sensitives(i don't like star wars content without force-wielders) and Lego and Vintage content are not Canon (i want to get all Canon content before i get into EU). So I bought Jedi Fallen Order it has good reviews for Story and gameplay and that's good for me. So I play Jedi Fallen Order now?"
1,"So today I watched Star Trek I for the first time. Now I grew up with Voyager and TNG reruns, and never got around to watching Motion Picture, II, III and IV. So I missed a lot. Getting around to it, I recently finally went ""lets watch them"" and the Motion Picture was... bizzare for Star Trek. It has a really deep philosophy and is slow, but actually easy enough to pay attention to. However, the Special Effects are some of the best I have seen ever, the only movie I can say is better was 2001. It's SFX was better than Star Wars which had a smaller budget. However, I don't think I have seen a movie this beautiful before.

Now the story is weird and kind of sucks. However, now that I watched Wrath of Khan I actually think ST 1 is better. I actually fell asleep watching Wrath of Khan. I might go back and watch it."

1,"I've noticed in several sci-fi franchises that there's usually very little attention to the *time* something happens, and I see it generally cause issues when exploring the lore of the franchise in question, but Star Trek doesn't have that problem due to stardates. Even though stardates might be confusing or sometimes meaningless, they are crucial to understanding how events took place in the franchise. 

Let's say you wanted to know when DS9's ""In The Pale Moonlight"" took place. Chances are, there's probably a stardate to tell you, or a year you can place the events of that episode in. But let's say you wanted to know how long Luke Skywalker trained on Dagobah in Empire Strikes Back. There isn't really any way to pinpoint that solely within the movies, as there isn't really any dialogue or anything to indicate how long that scene was in-universe. Could have been a few days, a week, there's not any way to tell. There might be some expanded universe explanation for it, but generally comes after-the-fact and by a different author/creator.

Stardates existing in Star Trek, across the various series, are an amazing concept and tool for dissecting the lore and timeline of events that happen within it's universe. They allow fans to figure out *when* something happened, and in what order it happened in. With stardates, you can explain what was happening in DS9 during an episode of TNG, or pinpoint when a character from DS9 showed up on TNG or Voyager. They might not be in every episode, but they're everywhere and there's enough to fill in the gaps between events. 

So, I'm glad that the writers kept using stardates and gave fans enough of them to piece together the timeline of Star Trek, I suppose."

Like the title says this is my idea of a perfect Star Wars game, that I would no doubt sink hundreds of hours into.

**Story:** I haven't come up with a specific story but how it would work would be similar to Old Republic. You will be able to choose different classes and each class will have their own storyline. I haven't decided what era I want to be in, but its gonna at least be sometime before the Rule of Two. The world and quest structure would be similar to Bethesda's RPG games. There can be different factions you can ally with or go against. If you choose to be a Jedi you wont be automatically hostile to the Sith's but you be very close to kill on sight, other way around if you are a Sith. Those are the only exceptions to faction alignment.

**Class Mechanics:** So how I would do the classes would be that each class would have their own skills, perks and storylines, but they won't have weapons or armor locked, such as in SWTOR. But lightsabers would specifically be used by Jedi's or Sith. That's the only locked weapon for me. But for example if you use a Jedi or Sith you can also use blasters if you wish.

**Combat:** This is one that excites me the most. I want a more immersive style of combat. So how it would work would be most blaster shots or lightsabers slashes would be one shot to enemies, but its also applied to you as well. But shots are body parts specific, for example if you are shot in the arm you aren't dead but you're injured and either movement, accuracy or if you're using a melee weapon your attacks will be affected, same goes with enemies. Obviously if you're or the enemy is shot in the head you or they are dead. Torso shots would have about an 80 percent fatality rate as well. It would also be in first or third person.

**Weapons and Armor:** Since most blaster shots are one shot, weapons won't have a damage meter. Instead they will have everything else including: accuracy, range, fire rate and cooling. Melee weapons will have durability and attack speed. Armors will work more efficiently than others, obviously. One such armor that would in the game would be Beskar, now Beskar would defend best against blaster shots and lightsaber attacks. It would also be the most rare and expensive armor to find. The more attacks you take the more damage the armor would take and eventually it would become useless to where you would die. The same goes for all the other armors in the game.

**Enemies and Difficulty:** So since I explained how the combat works, enemies difficulty wont be measured by damage but instead by their ""battle smarts"", I can't think of a word for what I'm trying to say. Enemies will generally try to aim at your head or torso but can miss obviously or if you move right maybe direct their blaster shots to an arm or leg if you can completely dodge away. Now being how the combat this game will be hard but not impossible, it will force to make you think more strategically before going into battle. If you are wearing full armor enemies may try to aim for weak spots, such as the neck or any exposed leg and arm joints. Same with fighting enemies. And example would be if you were to take a job to kill some Mandalorians, most likely they would have full beskar so your best bet would be to aim for weak spots or silently take them out.

**Music:** Star Wars.

**Visuals:** Nothing groundbreaking, but visually appealing.

**World and Exploration:** So this game would have a handful of systems to explore, with each system having a handful of planets. The map not being the entire galaxy but instead small enough to where it wouldn't kill the devs but also big enough to have a big open world to explore with many things to discover. Also the game for me could take place somewhere in the outer rim. How planet travel would work would be similar to No Man's Sky or Elite Dangerous, seamless flying down onto planets. Each planet will have a pretty large map to explore, with many small outposts along with some large cities, or planets like Nar Shaddaa. You can also get ships by either trading your current one or by doing the obvious and saving credits to buy one. Space battles would work how you would think, shields, heavy or light weaponry and by flight skill. If you disable a ship you can board and loot the ship. If you die either in a space battle or on ground you'll respawn on last save.

**General UI Features:** The game won't have a UI that looks like you piloting a ship but have the obvious stuff you would expect in a single player RPG. It will also have the quicksave feature along like the fallout games or skyrim.

So that's pretty much what the ideal Star Wars would be for me. It probably will never happen, at least to that scale, cause its a pretty daunting task to be honest. So tell me what you guys think. I probably missed a few things so point them out is necessary. If any of you have any questions or ideas I would be very open to hear them. Thank you"

1,"Question for you all out there. (sorry if this has been address before).

I am going back and watching TNG, its what I grew up with and is always the pinnacle of Trek for me.  But....I did have something that struck me as odd.

&amp;#x200B;

In TOS, most away teams consisted of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and a bunch of random security officers.  It always struck me as odd that the captain would be put into potential (and most times obvious) danger so frequently.  

&amp;#x200B;

With TNG, they address that.  Picard almost never is part of the initial away team.  (He comes down from time to time after the site is secure).  However.....the away team is always made up of like....3/4 of the senior staff.  Almost never do they bring the random security guys anymore.  

My question is...with all the lore of Trek, is there ever a reason given for this?  Like....it looks to me that you have all these different divisions of labor....Science, Command, Technology and Security etc.  That you would have a group of people in their own section specific for away teams.  People that are trained in alien terrain/adapting etc.  Combat, both armed and hand to hand.  Etc etc etc.

Now the ""obvious"" and probably main answer, is they wanted the cast members to be on the away teams, but they could just have easily had some of the cast members be in that division.  

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't take away from the show or anything, just struck me as odd and was wondering if there was an answer in all the lore/data etc.

Also, an unrelated observation: in the episode, Odo only interacts with Kira (and maybe a few people on the Defiant). We never see him interacting with the planet's inhabitants. That makes me wonder if perhaps, they don't get along."

REVIEW: 

  - Story: 

I absolutely adored and love this story but when i reached the end, i found myself saying.... ""Is this it ? Really ?"" With all the loose ends, i desperately wanted more. I dont know if EA was rushing them, or if Respawn is just lazy but the fact that the Haxion Brood story ended the way it did and the aftermath was just tedious bounty hunter fights, is saddening. The Crime-world of Star Wars is rich with its own lore and would have made for an amazing quest.... Heck, even if it had to be a paid for DLC expansion. The story could have used a few more cameos from bigger star wars names aside from the Wookie Chief and Darth Vader (I did say spoilers in the title). Aside from these things I've mentioned, the story is done quite well and successfully creates a unique star wars story that is enjoyable from start to finish. 

   - Lore 

Fallen Order delves straight into the Star Wars Universe lore in a way no other game has ever achieved. There is so much to learn, from Flauna, to Insects and Creatures, People and Places, Planet History, and so much more. Practically at every turn you'll have something new to learn about. I was overtaken but how much effort went into incorporating proper lore into the world. That alone makes the game worth playing in my opinion. 

  - Exploration:

Where do i begin, at first, the exploration seems amazing because of the world desgin allowing you to immerse yourself into the worlds of Star Wars, but this quickly becomes quite the opposite. The game is not open world, its semi open world and thats a stretch.... The best comparison i can make is this; each planet is essentially 1 large dungeon, each jammed filled with monsters, encounters, secret passage ways, boss fights and more. They try to spice this up by locking certain areas with abilties you havent earned yet, enticing you to return as the story continues. Some people enjoy this, but it became very repetitive in my books and quite stale. Not to mention those god forsaken puzzles..........

   - Combat:

Then, i have a Love/Hate realtionship with combat system in this game. On one hand, the lightsaber looks gorgeous, you can deflect blaster bolts in a very satisfying manor, the parry system is intensely difficult at first but boy does it look cool and allows for some nice finish animations.... And then on the other hand, the lightsaber sounds like its lagging half the time, maybe more than that but i got used to it by the end of the game, dismembement only happens in some extent to bugs and creatures, all basic human enemies stay intact no matter what, and the force abilties you unlock leave more or less to be desired. On the plus and negative side, this game does a very good job capitalizing on people's phobias and creates very scary moments for the player that will make your heart skip a beat. 

   - Graphics: 

I honestly think im being kind with a 6/10 rating for this games graphics.... About a third of the cut scenes in the game would have delayed audio. It got so bad at some points, that Cal or Cere would say an entire sentence with no sound, then the audio would play after or right when there finishing... And that's only scratching the surface, faces are blurry/unfinished and its not by the games blur effect, the game stutters all over the place. Some textures wont fully form, and will be extremely low vs everything else around it thats high textured. Some enemies would spawn later than they should cause the game is trying to load their models and get it all set up. Aside from the cut scenes, and low texture issues, the game has amazing graphics when your just exploring, and taking it in. You'll be taken away by how great and awful somethings look."
0,"The fact is if you like anything Star Wars, or in any way consider yourself a fan, you're a fan. There's no requirement for how much content you consume, what movies you've seen, who your favorite character is, etc. We are all Star Wars fans, and there is nothing that can elevate us to this fictional pedestal because it doesn't exist.

If you have a disagreement with someone over the quality of a particular story, it doesn't mean one of you is more ""enlightened"" or that the other is the wrong audience. You just have different opinions and that's okay. If you've decided to move on from the franchise, you don't lose the right to call yourself a fan, and you're always welcome back.

All that matters is that you consider yourself a fan, and that you try to be civil, rational, and kind when interacting with other fans. If you're going to talk about Star Wars, actually be open to discussing it, not dismissing things out of hand. Don't demand that things you don't like be erased, simply ignore it and embrace that which you appreciate. Don't resort to name calling, buzzwords, or petty political squabbles. Just be decent human beings (a lot to ask nowadays I know).

With how particularly nasty and misleading Star Wars YouTube/clickbait can be, I just felt it good to remind people of this oft ignored fact."
0,"So it was recently revealed from Kevin Kiner that he just finished working on episode 14. Interesting, that Disney wasn’t confident enough to give us more than 12 episodes for Clone Wars season 7 arguably way more important to canon than the Bad Batch, but for the spin off show they go all out with a 70 minute premiere and more episodes? This is what they should have done before. Why were they so stingy? It’s honestly frustrating. There were so many unfinished arcs from Clone wars that NEEDED to be done."
1,"In the first episode, Sisko still is so young and a angry, Picard still so proper and optimistic.

I would love to see these two characters meet again after all that’s happened to them and how they’ve grown. I wonder how their interaction would go?

I would really love to see them on screen together again."
0,"Curious as I cannot think of a single scene that captures everything there is that Star Wars explores at this moment (Can be all Star Wars media, e.g. Jedi: Fallen Order, or even the KOTOR games).

A few candidates in my mind would be:

* Luke rejecting the dark side: ""I am a Jedi, like my father before me""
* Binary sunset scene
* Yoda lifting the x-wing

Also, if you describe an image, could you link it in your comment, please!"
0,"is it possible that Force Ghost Anakin could appear in the Ahsoka show? I honestly think it would be really cool if it did happen, and since Hayden Christensen is coming back for the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, he could totally appear in Ahsoka. 

plus, it could be the closure for the friendship that Anakin and Ahsoka once had, which they no longer had the last time they saw each other."

0,"I’ve recently gotten really into reading the collection of fics on AO3 centered around Obi Wan Kenobi, lots of ones on his relationship with Anakin, time travel fix it, or the ones where he basically becomes a mandalorian.

1,"So I just finished watching Star Trek Voyager Season 2 episode Projections, its the one where Barclay cameos and where the Doctor is made to believe that he is human and all the rest of the crew are holograms and it eventually turns out its all in his head because his program is being corrupted.  Fun episode, but my wife, who has never seen Voyager before and thus was watching the show for the first time asks me after the episode ""Wait, if this was all in the doctor's head, how did he know exactly what the bridge and mess hall look like, he's never left sick bay?  He even commented that the bridge didn't look like he expected it would implying that if there are ship schematics he has access to that they don't match the actual bridge...""

Normally I have some convulted explanation when she asks me these kind of questions, you know, a wizard did it, its one of the joys of introducing all things star trek to my wife, but in this case I was left with out an explanation.

So I'm curious, for those who remember this episode, did you ever consider this seeming inconsistency before, and if so, do you have any head cannon explanation for how the doctor's delusion of the bridge and mess hall matched their real world appearances exactly despite his never having been there and even acknowledging that he'd always thought they (well at least the bridge) would look different?"
1,"I never had any contact with star trek other then seeing an episode here and there on TV. I never cared much for it, thinking that is seemed really slow and ""uncool"" compared with the likes of Star Wars and Firefly.  
Now in the big lockdown, I looked into Star Trek TNG on Netflix. Just for a few episodes, just to see what its about. I thought maybe it would be fun or at least an old show to laugh at old effects. But boy was I wrong.

I have been bingewatching it for several weeks, whenever I got a chance to watch tv, it was only star trek. I fell in love with the intense optimism and brightness, the characters and world, the problems they speak about and this utopian futuristic society. Both me and my fiance are in love with this show and we plan on seeing the rest of the franchise as well. I am excited that I have this huge IP, that I never really touched on, that I can discover all at once now. TNG, Deep Space 9, Voyager, Enterprise, Discovery and Picard. Not to mention all those movies, altough I'm not too sure about the correct order to watch it yet.

And in my very fresh love of Star Trek I just learned about the fanproject Stage 9, that was banned. Could anyone maybe dm me a way to find it? I would love to discover the Enterprise for myself."

Can anyone offer advice on how best to find them for a reasonable price?
1,"Gosh, just watched these 2 episodes for the first time in years, and I enjoyed it as much as several of the franchise's movies.  

Two entirely different storylines on and off the enterprise that shouldn't work in the time constraint of 90 minutes total, yet they do.  They do because of the outstanding script, gripping main cast and guest performances, and the pacing/editing of the narrative.  

I used to look at The Best of Both Worlds as being the epitome of TNG, but this re-watch makes me think it belongs in the same company.  

Reading about how Ronny Cox's character got Troi into real uniforms instead of the super sexy, skin tight garb she was in for years.  Look at how much her character changed after that and into the movies and even Picard.  And I also read that David Warner (Picard's torturer) was reading off of boards that were held up for him because he was cast late and didn't have time to memorize his lines.  

Just my retro perspective...or maybe it's retrospective or something...."

1,"The first two episodes seemed really rushed. Like they ran too long and they were forced to cut a lot to fill the time slot. Too much action, and not enough dialogue.

Is is it just me? And does it get better?"
1,OK so not Trek's finest outting. So let's look at the director. His previous helms were Executive Decision and US Marshals which were both just stinkers. However he edited some of the best films ever made getting into bed with Shane Black is never a bad choice. So this man was such a fan he traded some favors to get Nemesis. My theory is that editors are sort of the catchers and directors are the pitchers. I smelled a lot of differing opinions on what TNG's last movie should be and did a YouTube search on deleted scenes. I think he just was a pushover. It is easy to say he fucked up the last film and maybe jeopardized the film side for a decade. You can at least appreciate the respect he tried to imbue. Bit Jesus how many times mist Troi be mind raped?!?!

1,"I’m currently rewatching Enterprise and am pleasantly surprised by the number of gems in season 1. “Dear Doctor” may be one of the best Trek episodes ever, and “Acquisition” is absolutely hilarious. Ethan Philipps is a fantastic Ferengi, and seeing Jeffrey Combs is always fun. The way they utilise the Ferengi being Ferengi is awesome."
0,"When warned by both Vader, and by Thrawn (Thrawn #6 comic) that the Death Star could distract them, make themselves an easier target with less control over more regions, or exhaust their resources, Palpatine was of the opinion that with the Death Star's construction, there would be no need to expand the Imperial Navy and its very presence would dissolve opposition. But the entire time he was of this opinion, as we learn in TROS (which I think is a massive waste of an idea), he was already working on his contingency plan to build the Eternal Fleet.

So he rejected Vader and Thrawn's advice two times, but was already building the fleet anyway? If that's the case, why would they wait until the literal last moment to reveal this? There were hundreds of vessels in the fleet and I'm sure many of the Xystons with miniature Death Star beams could have been used the whole time. If the First Order had even a few of them that would be enough to turn the tides of the war very quickly.

I don't like how TROS contradicts Palpatine's intentions, and makes it seem like he was an incompetent Emperor who sat on the largest fleet in history without thinking to actually use it. It's like JJ Abrams had no care or respect for his character arc over the course of the first 6 films."
1,you know what would be fun see? a holodeck program that runs start to finish without taking over the ship or trying to kill the crew.   im sure it has happened somewhere in starfleet right?  ill admit that its rare. i assume for every narrow escape on the enterprise their are 6 other starships that arent so lucky.
1,"I just watched the season 3 finale first off its a great episode for a number of reasons one being it reminds me a lot of Among Us. Sabotage among crew mates, meeting to discuss, going off in pairs, the mess hall, and ESPECIALLY the finger pointing which kinda made me laugh how similar it felt to the game. DS9 really was ahead of its time."

0,"I understand that this might be a controversial post, but I am genuinely curious to know the thoughts and opinions of people on that subject.

WARNING: I am not bringing the matter of whether Rebel Alliance was justified in its actions or not. 

Namely, how the proverbial ""Bad Guys"" are portrayed in a fashion that offers them no empathy, no compassion, no mercy. 

It is easier to illustrate as an example.

Each Imperial Star Destroyer has a crew complement of roughly 30,000-37,000 members. You've heard correctly, thirty-seven thousand men and women serve aboard each Imperial Star Destroyer (with up to 10,000 troopers stationed temporarily as marines). 

Destroying each ISD is akin to slaughtering a small town. In the case of the Rebel Alliance, we are given dramatic shots of pilots dying, of how tragic and hurtful it is. But the killing of a crew of a single ISD, thirty-seven thousand mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters... is either not touched upon at all, or portrayed as a major victory for the proverbial ""Good Guys"", where such a massive loss of life is celebrated with bright and pompous events. 

I've been in the franchise for two decades now, and even in the mass of EU works, I cannot remember any time when any Rebel looked at the burning ISD and thought with horror: ""What have I done?""

I am not trying to justify either side in this, but in my personal opinion, Star Wars lacks any kind of self-reflection, any kind of empathy for your opponent - in fact, when I look at it, Star Wars comes off more horrifying than Warhammer 40,000, in the way it dehumanizes the enemies. 

So, I was wondering, what are people's opinions on this? How do you see it - or you do not see it as an issue at all?"
0,"Ok so I’m finally getting around to reading them and we know now that the Imperials have spaarti cloning cylinders. 

Why make a clone of a crazy old Jedi master when you probably have access to Vader’s blood? You could make an army of Anakins and train them from their young stage to be more passive. 

Or a bunch of pretty much whomever? Obviously the Imperials had the blood or info on most every Jedi from the Republic since they took over after the Clone Wars. An army of evil Yoda clones would scare the crap out me. 

Nope. They go for a crazy old guy."

1,"Lots of spoilers below so watch out!!!!!!

———————————————————————

I just finished the show and it all just felt right to me. 

Aside from some occasional clunky dialogue I loved the new characters, how Rios ends up following Picard and believing in the mission despite the trauma that was plaguing him. That moment where he asks Picard basically “what if we’re wrong” and Picard reverts right back to the confident, dedicated leader he used to be. 

I also loved the multiple versions of his personality split over the the ship’s holos. I think the draw of a new Star Trek show is getting to see how they creatively build a crew and keep things feeling fresh, (Spock to Data to Seven of Nine etc.) so a bunch of versions of the same guy each with different accents and personalities is just a perfect evolution to me.

I think Raffi is a great redemption of a broken, bitter person. Picard did sort of abandon her, he was selfish and turned away from the people he loved because of his pride, and she’s right to be upset with him. But I think  after she sees her son and it really doesn’t seem like things can be patched up, she realizes she can still make amends with him at least. Picard’s arms are open to her in the way she was to her son, the choice is her’s to fix things then. They’re very similar, solitary people with a lot of walls up, so I liked how they sort of resolved the faults in each other, I’m excited to see where their friendship/partnership goes. 

I’ll also add that Elnor coming to her, needing someone to cry to, really got to me, that physical affection of this young person in need, being able to give him that comfort, was exactly what she might never have with her son.

Finally, that final scene with Data... I’m a wreck, and I didn’t see anything like that coming. The whole show Picard is having these dreams about being able to talk to Data again, not wanting the dreams to end. He finally gets his wish but in meeting the real Data again (or some form of him) he encounters Data’s wants and needs, the ultimate want to know his impermanence and to die. This isn’t at all what Picard would have imagined meeting Data again would be, (EDIT: for data to ask him to end the dream) but he fulfills his friend’s wish selflessly. 

Those shots of Picard sitting beside him as he goes in the simulation were really touching to me, because we never get to see our heroes die on their own terms, the way anyone would want, with someone they love holding their hand, content with their life. 

Anyway, I could probably rant incoherently about this show for a while, I just wanted to see what others connected with in the show. I know a lot of people here weren’t really into it, but I figure there’s probably some of us who liked it and wanna chat about it."

So hooked that I instantly preordered it and must’ve reread it 20 or 30 times in anticipation for January. I’ve now read all the books and comics so far in The High Republic and have started a book collection that spans many genres (which I never thought of something I’d have and treasure so much). So to everyone at Lucasfilm, on Skywalker Ranch, and all the fabulous authors who bring the galaxy far, far away we all know and love to life; thank you. Thank you for saving me in one of my darkest hours. Thank you so much.

1,If they had found out during the war obviously they would side with the domion and the federation and the klingon empire would be conquered.  But what would they do if they found out after the war?  Would they declare war against the federation.  Without the dominion to help them and considering the federation has an alliance with the klingons that would be foolish.  So what do you think the romulans would do if they figured out they were lied to.
1,"I notice in recent years it seems like in backlash to how Roddenberry is worshipped as a genius artist, people who are a bit more into Star Trek than your casual fans have started to bash Roddenberry as being a hack who took up the spotlight of other creative artists esp various writers of the show.

I had one person tell me Roddenberry ripped off some old Western TV show and actually is responsible for TOS's being so weak in the first season but because he's the creator all credit goes to him even though he almost destroyed TOS into getting canceled early. Another person even uses Roddenberry's name as an example in other industry much like how Ho Chi Minh is called the George Washington of Vietnam. Specifically he stated that Naoko Takeuchi, author of Sailor Moon, is the Roddenberry of anime/manga since Sailor Moon's  popularity came from the anime adaptation and because Naoko created the original manga she gets all the credit as genius and the various people who worked on the anime are unknown for their hard devotion to the series. That Naoko is a really bad artist and storyteller and so she deserves to be called a Roddenberry (in response to how this specific Trekkie feels Gene is a very terrible writer and showrunner but the mainstream unfairly sees him as a genius while the real creative minds behind TOS and the Star Trek franchise have faded in obscurity).

I am very new to Trekkie, I just finished TOS back in August and have yet to start on TNG. So new that I only knew Star Trek by reputation and never seen anything related to it except on random documentaries and magazine covers. But I am skeptical at the treatment by people who are a bit more into the series than I am (yet aren't hardcore fans). Just for the simple fact their criticisms seem to come under the assumption that if you are the producer you just sit back and command people like a dictator while chilling drinking lemonade.

I know enough about the producer role from the Behind the scenes stuff of my other favorite shows like Charmed to know that even if other people are actually indeed responsible for stuff like improved writing after season 1 of TOS, that having the credit of producer isn't just some random thing thrown around like a cool honor but actually is a very stressful job full of responsibilities.

What is the reality? Could Roddenberry simply have come up wit the basic idea and tell it to someone else and other people would have turn Star Trek into a beloved franchise? Did he just go around stealing ideas like many attackers imply?"

0,"I'm not a professional editor by any means, I do it primarily for fun and enjoyment and this edit isn't to condone Attack of the Clones, but to celebrate it. :)

I've always had an idea to do my own personalised version of Attack of the Clones that makes a few tweaks and cuts out scenes entirely from the film. I felt like sharing a list of some of the scenes that I've cut/tweaked so far to make the film faster less bogged down and also less creepy and cringy.

\-I've cut out the line: ""guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all."" So now it's just: ""We made it"" we cut to a close up of the two and then we cut to the queen coming out of her ship with her guards and the ship explodes the film continues on normal until we come to the scene where Obi-Wan and Anakin come to Padme's apartment.

We see a shot of the lift going up as normal but then we cut to Jar Jar, I've cut the scene out not because I dislike the scene with Obi-Wan and Anakin but because of the length of the film itself, the original runtime is 142 minutes with credits and I've cut it down to 124 Minutes with credits ending around the 1:58:30 mark unlike the original which I believe is around the 2:16:05 mark. This simply a quality control situation.

The film continues on as usual until we cut from Anakin's line: ""I meant in the interest of protecting her master, of course."" to Obi-Wan saying: ""Learn your place young one...."" Showing Obi-Wan to be a bit more stern and Anakin respects him by not talking anymore instead of arguing back.

the film continues on as normal until we cut to the first scene with Sam or Zam depends if her name is spelt in a Star Warsy way or not, instead of seeing Jango telling her what to do we cut to her loading the droid up already adding a bit of more mystery to who she is because she has her mask over her face until a certain point.

The droid goes off and we cut to the scene where Obi-Wan tells Anakin that he looks tired and the film continues on pretty much the same from this point on until we cut to Anakin saying: ""Who hired you? Tell us. . . ."" Instead of the awful line delivery of: ""tElL uS nOw."" we cut from who hired you tell us to Obi-Wan's face looking towards Anakin as if to say: ""Anakin, mind your attitude."" to then the Bounty Hunter saying her line as usual.

Then we see Jango for the first time adding mystery to who this guy is and where he comes from. The film continues on as normal until the next apartment scene, Anakin says as usual: ""In someways, a lot of ways I'm really ahead of him, I'm ready for the trials."" and then cut to Padme saying: ""Sometimes our masters see more of our faults than we want them to, it's the only way we grow."" and Anakin says: ""I know."" showing that even though Anakin is a bit impatient he understands respectfully instead of dissing off his master acting like Obi-Wan's a prick in the scene.

We then crossfade here to the next scene, instead of anakin being creepy: ""Sorry m'lady."" He seems more genuine and nice here. :)

The film continues on until unfortunately we cut Dex's diner scene I know this is important to the film, but I've cut it simply because it drags the film on, I feel it does at least, and I like that Obi-Wan has a bit of a brain instead of asking some random diner the question. I'm thinking about readding the deleted scene where he goes to test what the dart is and then cutting to the archive scene, Obi-Wan already has some form of an idea of a planet he must've heard about before and goes searching as usual.

We cut the scene where Anakin explains to Padme about love and stuff because even thought the scene itself I don't mind it ends with creepiness as well: ""You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams."" maybe I should try and cut it down from there to ""You haven't changed a bit!"" which is more cute than the follow up line.

That's just some of the things I've cut, I'll update on more once a bit more is done. :)"

I know Picard takes place after TNG and what I'm wondering is if TNG is considered required viewing before watching Picard. I'm okay with some spoilers and I don't always mind watching some things out of order (in fact, sometimes watching a spin off series first has made me more interested in going back and watching the original). So anyway, I do plan to go back and watch all of TNG at some point, but am interested in watching Picard now and want to make sure I'm not making a mistake I will regret if I watch them out of order."

But when you show f""cking Luke at Mandalorian, I simply have no choice but to check it out. Maybe it's just the inner Scorsese in me wanting actual films to be in the spotlight more often instead of these heartless, passionless projects. Mandalorian literally is the blandest sht I've seen in a while. Sure it has the atmosphere of the original which I like, but everything else, the story, the characters, the themes are things a child could write. Give me one original or interesting idea in this show?? Give me one interesting character in this show?? (Aside from Bill Burr of course). Great visuals are simply nothing if everything else is just emptiness. Mandalorian having a higher score than BoJack Horseman or Mad Men just kills me.

1,"I  know I'm late to the party, but I'm just watching Lower Decks for the  first time as it just appeared on Prime in my country and I'm in love  in Star Trek again!

This is the  best Star Trek since DS9. I love the crazy stories and adventures that fit to the traditional single episode story. I love those goofy  characters and Futurama/Family Guy comedy style. But mostly I appreciate going back to the roots, to TNG era of ST.

I love how self aware the show is, how they don't afraid to make jokes of the absurd things from previous shows.

Can't believe Kurtzmans name is still attached to this show, I guess he is there just as the formality?"

0,"So I was thinking about the potential of what the very first scene could be in the new Kenobi series and this is what I came up with. Open with blaster fire on a battle field, but you can’t make out what or who is shooting. Two Jedi with blue lightsaber come into the shot with clone trooper following then. You now realize this is a flash back scene to the clone wars. The Jedi are Anakin and Obi wan. They’re slicing battle droid left and right and they’re having fun sarcastic banter that any clone wars fan would be familiar with. Obi wan pushed forward threw the battle and realizes Anakin is not near, he turns around to se Anakin just standing there facing away from him. Obi shouts Anakin’s name then eventually runs over to him and say Anakin we need to leave as he turn Anakin around to see his face. What Obi wan then sees is how Anakin looked when Obi wan left him for dead on Mustafar, burnt and scared. Obi wan is horrified. You then here the “I HATE YOU” scream the last words Anakin said to Obi wan. We then cut to a shot of Obi wan waking up panting and sweating. It was a nightmare, and by the look on Obi wan’s face it wasn’t the first. Screen fades to black. Title card appears. OBI-WAN KENOBI."

0,"Genuinely the coolest thing to me about the wasted character of Finn was that he could hold his own in a lightsaber fight on the pure skill of his training from birth as a stormtrooper. (Although its inconsistent with the useless stormtroopers with no way around plot armour). But if they could've made him an elite trooper like Phasma who still had a good reason to desert the First Order it would make more sense. Could've made his and Phasma's fight more meaningful too. Just sad that there's such deep wasted potential with these films, John Boyega deserved so much more than screaming ""Rey""."

0,"At least I think it's a star wars game? 

Back when I was much younger there was this RTS/ Base building sim I used to play probably around 2003. I remember that it was sci-fi and it was full of weird-looking aliens. I also remembered that there are underwater bases you need to build too, and the cities/buildings would be built inside these bubble type things. 

After loads of searching around, I managed to filter it to the Otoh Gunga. I'll never forget the underwater city bubbles from the game and it looks pretty much identical to the images from the films. When I put it all together it all makes sense with the aliens, strange planets etc. 

I've had a lot of looking around online I can't find any Star Wars RTS/City building games so posting here as a last effort. 

Hopefully one of you has maybe played it before? 

Any help would be appreciated!!"

1,If the federation handed bajor to the cardassians would sisko go along with it?  I doubt it.  He may even violate the prime directive and fight the cardassians.  And if he did that he would be just like the maquis.  The people he condemns.  The way the federation treated the maquis was horrible.  You can't just hand someone's home over to an evil empire and not expect them to take up arms to defend it.  And that is what sisko would do if the federation handed bajor to the cardassians.  At the very least he would destroy the wormhole to give them less of an incentive to occupy the planet.  He may even refuse to give up control of deep space nine.  He may even move the station back into bajor's orbit to defend the planet.  So I think the way sisko treated the maquis was horrible and I think he would do the same thing in their shoes.  Let me know what you think in the comments.

1,"I'll preface this by saying I've loved Riker and Worf since I was a little kid watching TNG on recorded VHS and Columbia House Video tapes, and as an adult while Riker is still my favourite, followed by Worf, I've definitely grown to recognize Picard is a better character, the star of the show, and Patrick Stewart really brings the show together in ways the other cast could not.

That said, in Sins of the Father I've always felt that Riker was a better choice as cha'DIch for Worf.  It comes later on, but Worf relies on Riker for the Klingon suicide ritual in Ethics, and Riker says he would've done it if he didn't recognize Worf was wussing out and not relying on his son like Klingon law states.  Worf also even offers to later join Riker if he were to leave the Enterprise in The Outcast.  Picard served as Riker's best man in Nemesis, which was done for fairly obvious reasons I suppose, but I felt given their relationship Worf would definitely be a solid choice.  Seeing Riker and Worf together trying to save Alexander and that little pet...snake...thing... was another great scene.  Or Riker calling Worf sexist for saying the dress uniform looks feminine, or telling Worf he hates surprises as he conspires to set up a surprise birthday party, the list goes on and on.

I guess what I'm trying to say is they have a great relationship, and it's really enjoyable to watch, and even as a kid I felt Riker was the clearer choice as cha'DIch for Worf.  Younger, extremely capable fighter, and experience around Klingons given the exchange program from before.  So why Picard?  I can only suppose Patrick Stewart was more the lead character and it was another stepping stone to Picard interacting and solidifying a relationship with a member of his senior staff.  I've considered as well that Frakes had fewer combat roles than perhaps his character suggested because of his back difficulties.  There is also the fact it lent some solid interaction to Worf and Picard's characters in First Contact.

I dunno, I guess another perspective outside of my skewed childhood one is all I'm looking for here.  What are other people's thoughts?  Thanks!"

I recently watched the entirety of Voyager, after getting into it with the newer discovery series.

Ds9 couldn’t hold my attention. It felt weird. I watched the first episode and was like “???” unsure of whether or not I could get into it. I didn’t have much interest, but I keep hearing how good it is and am wondering if early episodes are bad, or something. 

TNG I’m on s01e09 and it’s marginally more interesting but lately I just scroll by, finding less and less interest. 

So, maybe you guys won’t have any advice but I’m hoping to be surprised with a “this series is really trash for the first season” or something. 

Thanks for your suggestions!"
0,"My working theory is that his parents were powerful aristocrats that somehow became aware that their son was sensitive to the force before the Jedi were able to test him.

His parent, fearing that the Jedi would take their son away to train him, conspire to hide his force powers from the Jedi.

So Palpatine grows up his whole life hiding his powers, using them to subtly advance his political career, like a Jedi mind trick of the masses. I like to think that while he was desperately searching for some kind of information or guidance about his powers he stumbled onto the teachings of the sith.

Anyways that's my take on a young Palpatine, not sure if there is any kind of cannon content that would contradict my theory but I like it."

0,"The 9 core movies are broken up into 3 categories, essentially. The original trilogy, the prequels and the sequels, each consisting of 3 films. 

What I keep noticing is people tend to praise or lament each category, rather than the films individually.

For example, you either love or hate the sequels. That's it. As though The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker must be lumped together when speaking about their quality or lack thereof.

Why not judge each film on it's own merits? I get that each series of films is telling a greater story, but the differences in the films are there. The sequel trilogy is a great example. I loved Force Awakens, hated Last Jedi and was pretty ambivalent towards Rise of Skywalker. So which camp do I fit into? I don't hate the sequels and I don't love the sequels. I both hate and love different entries.

And you'll get what you wanted: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant, and all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal… and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer.

I love the original films (and the prequels certainly overcompensate at parts), but Lee and Neeson definitely brought a legitmacy to lightsaber combat. Id be curious to see how it would've turned out without their input.

Fights like the throne room fight in TLJ and even fights in Clone wars, Mando, and Rebels all became intense feats of skill rather than who can do the floppiest flip."
1,"I've just finished a rewatch of TOS, TAS, and the Kirk and Co movies, but before I started I decided I'd make a little game of how many times Dr. McCoy says, ""he's dead, Jim,"" and ""In a doctor, not a _____"" and variations thereon. Basically, whenever Bones said someone was dead or specified he was a doctor I put a mark on a running tally. Here's what I totaled:

""He's dead, Jim"": 26
""I'm a doctor, not a _____"": 11

Interestingly, all but one instance came from the original series, with the sole outlier being from the animated series where McCoy announces someone's died. The fact that he never verbally announced a death or his profession across six movies surprised me, even though I've seen each one multiple times.

Do with this information what you will, it was just fun to me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to rewatch TNG and it's movies and keep a tally of his many times they say ""Prime Directive."""
0,"So many people claim it’s sjw trash and favors diversity over good storytelling. So I decided to read into the dark a book in the high republic. 
And my god I think it’s amazing. While the characters are diverse, it’s like a paragraph describing what they look like and then moves one. It doesn’t constantly remind you of it. The characters are still well developed, you get snippets of the backstory of some plot points. There’s also lots of twists that I couldn’t predict at all. And they really show the differences then compared to now. The galaxy feels calmer, everyone talks about how the galaxy is amazing but the villains are still really cool and a good departure from average sith we always get. 

So yeah, the things people are saying about the high republic aren’t accurate, and I’m really excited for the acolyte since it takes place during the high republic."
0,"* A new hero and a new supporting cast with no ties at all to the heroes of the past. With the Skywalker Saga over, it's time for Star Wars to find new challenges, ideas, and heroes who have no famous lineage, but rather stand on their own and make their own names.
* No more superweapons. Their expensive, and they inevitably get destroyed. The new villains need powers or tech that's considered standard to them, yet can cause as much destruction as a superweapon. Just to show how dangerous they are.
* New Planets, or planets that are mentioned but not seen yet, or planets that only got one appearance outside the movies. The galaxy needs to expand, and more must be seen to create new stories and characters. I'd love to see more of Malastare, or travel to Ithor.
* Have a new mundane starter job for our new hero or heroine. Star Wars heroes often begin with lowly jobs, and since I don't want the next hero to have any lineage or prophecy to them, they might have the lowest start. Ideal jobs could be technician, janitor, office worker, hospital caretaker, maybe their even a struggling single parent. That would be a new taste in Star Wars heroes. But it's not lineage or prophecy that gets them on their way, it's their character and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
* New vibes for the villains. Our new villains need different evil vibes to distinguish them from the Sith, Mandolorians, CIS, Empire, or First Order. Me personally, I think the Soviet Union would be a good inspiration.
* A VERY different and liberal Jedi Order. If Rey and others founded a new Order, it's essential that they not repeat the mistakes of the Old Order or Luke's Order. If I could have my way, they'd adopt the philosophies of Qui-Jon Jinn, they bend to the will of the Force, rather then make the Force bend to their will. They also would not be as active in war.
* If the Grysk are our new villains, like the Yuuzhan Vong, there needs to be some good Grysk. 
* If necessary, old planets from the past 3 trilogies can be brought back, but this time for new roles.
* Have a villain who acts more like a fundamentalist knight templar rather then a typical Dark Lord. This is a villain who not only thinks he's doing good and has some understandable motives, but also has the support of the common folk, or can sway common folk to his side very easily. This serves as a warning against crowd following.
* We see more of what everyday life in the galaxy is like."

0," I noticed this question pop up on Instagram and I just... think it's being a bit over dramatic. 

 Echo was in this form of a cryostasis chamber for like? A year and half? Of course he's gonna come out sickly and pale. He was on the verge of death. Then people all the sudden expect him to make a full recovery in the time we're given? If they *were* white washing him, they wouldn't make him frail and give him *blue lips*. He's supposed to look sick because *he is*.

 He is obviously in a state of recovery and I don't expect him to recover that fast given the time between the Bad Batch arc of Season 7 and Order 66. I don't think its justified to call it white washing.

 I'll clarify that I am white and I really don't have room to talk, but I want some *civil* discussion regarding this. I'm genuinely curious if people really think Echo is being whitewashed.

1,"Considering that they were pretty much the only Vulcans on board Voyager, I always thought it was weird they were never really seen interacting with each other except in Blood Fever (S3 E16).

1,"My experience is limited to TV shows and movies only, with the exception of the original series, but I really believe that Discovery is the one who highlights the concept of the Federation. In TNG we can see the ingrained ideals they have, but what about the ideals of the common citizen, for TNG we could think that these ideals are typical of the crew itself or at most of starfleet. Voyager, for its part, presents us with different moral conflicts, but always from the same perspective already known, it does not give us about the common citizen, although in this show it could be said that it is justified. If we think about Deep Space 9 it gives us a look at ordinary citizens, such as what was the conflict on earth with the shapeshifters. The idea of ​​having citizens concerned about having the starfleet on the streets already tells us something about the united federation of planets and what they think, but since it only shows us in a couple of episodes, it does not stand out in general. But then arrives Discovery, with a mission to rebuild the Federation, the fact of having people waiting for his return, or that memorable scene in unification part 3, that's when I really cared about the United Federation of Planets."

1,"For Janeway it has to be Tuvix, right? And for Sisko probably In The Pale Moonlight. What about the other captains? Or other main characters?"
1,"So me rewatching the Kelvin Timeline Movies, and I had never noticed that Pike said some bullshit...

~Your father was the captain of a starship for 12 minutes... He saved 800 lives...~

I'm calling bullshit! There's no way you can convince me a ship smaller than the Constitution-Class (Crew Compliment of 430) has more people on it! Hell, the comparable Miranda-Class only carries a compliment of 220 on regular basis. George Kirk saved, at most, 250 lives and that's me being generous!"
1,"First off, it was an excellent series. The storylines, character development, and relationships within the series was probably the best of any Trek series I've watched. I enjoyed the series a lot more than I expected to which was a nice surprise and it's a little depressing knowing there won't be any more stories to tell from DS9, at least on video. 

I did have one problem that irked me and it was in the last few minutes of the series finale. &gt;!When Worf is leaving the station and they show the montage of some of his memories, they didn't include Jadzia in a single clip. To have such an integral and vital character that was one of the best of the series be omitted in the final episode was a slap in the face to the character Jadzia and the actress Terry Farrell. She deserved better.!&lt;

I'm going to finish Voyager now that I've gone though DS9. I started watching it a few years ago but got bored with it somewhere in season two. Maybe I'll enjoy it but I don't think the quality will be the same as DS9."

I have questions:

1. The separatists seemed clearly better prepared for war. And if clone wars is any indication. without the jedi the clone army probably would have been fucked. So what would have happened if the ""seppies"" won?

2. Do we know what happened to naboo after the takeover?"

1,"One thing that has always bugged me about Trek is the blatant fumbling of representation of minorities and I’m sure I’m not the only one. I feel like it’s such a tragedy that we got the gibberish white people translation of Native American culture through Chakotay and in other episodes (without going into the why - we done been knew). 

I’m not Native American myself, but one thing I really love about Trek is it’s ability to imagine a future where people who have been brutally wronged and mistreated can flourish and I would have loved to seen how an actual  Native American writer would have envisaged that. 

This goes for other minorities and people that have been misrepresented in Trek but this is one example that springs to mind often. Am I alone in this? If there are any Native American folks on this sub also I would be really interested to know how the show has made you feel or what you wanted to have seen."
0,"I'm watching The Clone Wars Season 5 Episode 11 (A Sunny Day in the Void) and noticed a couple of interesting things about hyperspace. 

First, while flying through hyperspace WAC-47 tells Gascon that they detected comets ahead and are going to collide with them. Col. Gascon gets to the cockpit and finds the alarms blaring. He checks the displays and immediately drops the ship out of hyperspace to find they're in the middle of a field of comets. The comets do not appear to be much larger than the shuttle they are flying. It seems that this is further evidence pre-Disney canon allowed for the possibility that an object in hyperspace can collide with a relatively small object in real space. Why else would the alarms be going off? Why would Col. Gascon drop out of hyperspace unless he was afraid if colliding with the objects? 

Second, when Col. Gascon gets to the cockpit hyperspace is all red and not blue. &gt;!This is the same way it was described in LOTJ when the Legacy Run collided with the Nihil ship.!&lt; I never noticed this before and thought it was a new idea in LOTJ. Has hypespace looked red any other times?"

1,"I didn't have the words to describe this as a child, but at the time, in all of television, Spock stood out as someone I could relate to. His analytical approach to everything resonated with me. His lack of understanding of human emotions was something I struggled with. Later, in TNG, as Data struggled to learn and adopt human ways he became my go-to character to connect with.

But my favorite neuro-divergent stand-in characters are 7of9 and the Doctor. They both were more akin to my own divergence, especially the Doctor. His outward theatrics, while he struggled to establish his persona, is a great example of what masking feels like.

It may be because Voyager had two of these characters that it holds a special place in my love of Star Trek. Conversely, DS9 doesn't really have anyone that plays this role and that is probably why, no matter how great I hear it is, I just don't fully connect with it. It may be the one thing the Orville really lacks for me. Isaac is slightly doing it, but ever so slightly, as he doesn't even care to be human-like.

That said, live long and prosper, my neuro-freaky friends."

0,"I will start with my top pic. Ambassador Furgan from the Jedi Academy Trilogy. This dude has the misfortune of being sandwiched between Admiral Daala, who gives Zapp Baragin from Futurama a run for his money in terms of incompetent commanders, and Exar Kun, who makes his first appearance in the trilogy but plays a bigger role in overall lore. In his own right, Furgan is a warlord that is as formidable as Thrawn or Zinsji. From his humble beginnings he became one of the Empire’s few non-human officers with any level of influence and when the Empire fragmented after Endor, he was left controlling Cardia the primary Stormtrooper Academy. From here he managed to poison Mon Mothma nearly killing her and still managed to get her to step down as Chief of State, destroyed the Cathedral of Winds one of the 20 wonders of the galaxy and got Ackbar to resign in the process, designed the excellent MT-AT, and planned on kidnapping baby Anakin Solo and molding him into a new Emperor and would kill Anakin before he would give him back. He was very close to succeeding in his plans too. Only the decision of Daala to attack Mon Calamari and Exar Kin’s manipulation of Kyp Durron ended causing him to fail."

0,"Ok so I’m gonna tell you all about my experience watching Star Wars for the first time so here we go. 

My first experience with Star Wars was when I was 5 years old with the Leapster Explorer Star Wars the Clone Wars. The leapster was a gaming system for little kids that taught basic stuff such as math and reading. My parents bought me this game for some reason and I really liked it. I don’t know why but I specifically remember the droidekas from that game. 

My second experience came from the Force Awakens, a full 5 years after I had played the previous game. My parents rented it from RedBox and although I had no idea what was going on I liked the movie but didn’t put much more thought into it. 

Then for some reason, two years after I had watched the force awakens I decided that I wanted to get into Star Wars. Somehow my uncle found out about this and since he owned all the movies digitally he of course let me watch one of the movies. I decided I wanted to start from the beginning and watched the phantom menace. Once again I had no idea what was going on, but I realized that the boys name was anakin skywalker. I knew who Luke skywalker was despite never watching anything else Star Wars, and knew that darth vader was his dad also. I figured that Anakin must have been darth vader and so I somewhat spoiled the reveal of Anakins betrayal by googling what happened. 

At this point I don’t really remember the complete order of how I watched the rest of Star Wars but I believe that I watched a bunch of movie clips on YouTube of both the prequels and originals and then I watched rogue one for free on Netflix. Once again I was continuing to watch Star Wars in the worst way possible. 

After understanding the basic plot of all the Star Wars movies I finally got the chance to see one in theaters with the last Jedi. A month after it was released I went to the theaters with my mom and I loved it. I thought it was great couldn’t wait until the sequel came out. I was of course super surprised to see that a lot of people didn’t like the movie but I didn’t let that bother me too much. In present day I still love the last Jedi but I think that a story like this would have been a lot better if it was always meant to be non-canon (of course it would never have been a movie if it was non-canon but still) and I do hope all of the sequels are removed from canon despite how much I like the last Jedi. 

Finally after all this I got the original trilogy for Christmas and I thought they were great. I don’t have much else to say about them they were just really good. 

I believe I might have watched all of the clone wars tv show before the original trilogy and the last Jedi but I don’t really remember. I only know that I watched the clone wars before I watched...

The prequel trilogy. After this long journey I finally watched both attack of the clones and revenge of the sith on Disney plus. I don’t know why I didn’t buy the movies or rent the movies before waiting until Disney plus released but I did. Going into the movies I knew they would have a lot of problems so I knew to not let them bother me. I didn’t care for attack of the clones but thought that revenge of the sith was genius. I knew it could have been better of course, but that it was still the best Star Wars movie by far in my opinion. 

Finally the rise of skywalker was released and before watching it I knew that the reception was not going to be good and that Disney should reboot the sequel trilogy. Still, on my first watch of it in theaters I really liked it, but wasn’t that crazy about it. Then on a rewatch a few months later I realized that it wasn’t that good and that is still how I feel about it. 

If you read all of that thanks for reading it. I just thought it was kind of funny how awful of a way I watched all of the movies."

1,"So I've always been a star trek fan since I was a kid. I grew up watching Next Gen, and it's still my go to when I want to just have something playing in the background while cooking or doing chores. Unfortunately, most of my friends have no interest in it, and I totally understand that it doesn't appeal to everyone the way that it does to me. I had never seen DS9 before last year when I finally watched it during lockdown. And holy crap, not only is it my favorite Star Trek series now, I think it legit might be the greatest show I've ever watched. I only finished it a few months ago, and I've already been wanting to restart it from the beginning. The really cool thing is that I have one friend who has had his curiosity piqued and is willing to give DS9 a shot! Knowing how much he loves his character writing, I think he'll end up loving this series. I had him watch The Best of Both Worlds in preparation, and we just watched Emissary last night. He's already excited to see where DS9 goes, and I'm ecstatic to be watching this with someone who is going in 100% blind to star trek as a whole. It's like seeing it for the first time all over again!"

0,"When TFA came out I wasn't sure what Kylo's age was meant to be. In my head I personally thought of him as being younger and closer to the age his grandfather was when he had fallen. Even a few months later when I learned that he was 29 in TFA it didn't really click with me. I don't remember when I learned Rey's age but it was basically the age I assumed 18 or in her case 19.

I didn't really think much about the age gap until TLJ when the shipping wars really started to take off (finnrey vs reylo vs finnpoe vs whatever) and people started putting Rey and Kylo together as romantic interests instead of just protagonist and antagonist. 

And one of the things that stuck out to me was the age difference between the 19 year old Rey and the 29 yr old Kylo. It was also the same  amount of age gap between Han and Leia (Legends even had the age gap at 12 years). So I recently wanted to figure out what it is about the two pairings that makes me ok with the age gap in one case, that of Han and Leia but find it creepy in the other, that being Rey and Kylo. And my conclusion seems to be experience and intent. 

I don't really mean relationship experience as I don't think Kylo really has any more relationship experience than Rey would have unless he did have a relationship with Tai. But even there Han and Leia are equals with both having a number of significant others in their past before meeting each other. 

What I mean by experience is experience with the world/galaxy. Yes Rey grew up as an orphan and had to learn to defend herself, teach herself how to repair things, deal with other people on her planet, etc but even then she is still as sheltered in a way as Luke is. She has never been off planet, she's only seen most of what she has learned through holotapes and games not first hand. She meets some aliens and learns enough trade languages to get by but she isn't say traveling there and learning about them and partaking in their culture. Life to her is a daily struggle for survival. She is missing, or should be missing, a lot of life skills and experiences that those growing up in civilization would get. She's a backwater bumpkin like Luke is. 

Then you have Kylo who is much more experience both as Ben Solo who was raised on Tyferra and went to good schools and diplomatic functions and trips with his parents before joining his Uncles temple and learning even more about cultures and people and traveling to new places. Then as Kylo we have him learning about warfare, killing people, the darkside and the light, all of these other things that gives him a huge deal more life experience than Rey. It seems like some guy who has way more life experience coming in and taking advantage of a person from the countryside who has never left their farm so to speak. Rey is more emotionally mature than Kylo but that's about the only thing she has on him. 

But when it comes to Leia and Han neither one seem more experienced than the other.  Both are well traveled and have been to multiple planets all over the galaxy. Both have held down important jobs and have a wealth of life experiences behind them with Leia being a rebel and senator and Han being a tie pilot and smuggler. Sure Han has 10 years on her but when it comes to what their life has been like and what they have done and where they have went feels pretty equal. Each knows some things the other doesn't and both have a good base in common so it doesn't feel so much like a person who is her elder by a decade taking advantage of her it feels more like a person who knows what she is doing. And both of them seem much more experienced than Luke.

Which brings me to the next part which is intent. Just off the bat the fact that one is a hero while the other is the villain means the intent is different but  lets look at Han. Right off the bat their is snark and flirtatious teasing between him and Leia. Both of them giving as good as they get. and then all through the rest of the movie and ESB (and of course the comics and books) its the same thing. Its not Just Han pushing the issue with no response from Leia its her constantly bantering back or teasing him and this is a character that would be more than capable of telling Han off if she thought he went to far in his advances. We throughout the entire saga know that these are two people who love to argue and banter with each other but have problems being truthful. Sure Han may go a bit to far in the engine room according to how we see things today (and no this isn't excusing anything because ""that's just how it was then"" its just pointing it out that it happened and was considered romantic if it was the right person doing it at the right time) but that is a movie made 40 years ago and looking at TFA it has things we see as problematic today. 

Unlike with Han and Leia we don't see Rey and Kylo bickering and bantering and instead see a large power imbalance. The first time they meet she is frozen in place, knocked out, tied up, then with Kylo standing over her he says ""You know I can take whatever I want""....now maybe I watch to much SVU and cop dramas but my mind goes one place. And speaking of minds he then invades hers  against her will in a way that looks painful to her and scrapes through her memories. 

And here during this moment is where we are told their ""relationship"" starts because while he is getting that information she is also getting his memories of training in how to use the force (explaining her powers in the fight and in TLJ) and his memories of his time before Kylo. 

So she gets to know what he was like before but we don't which doesn't really make some of us feel like their is that connection. Han and Leia showed us time and again they cared. But with Rey and Kylo we are told that they care for each other because of a memories we don't get to see and despite only spending a limited amount of time together. 

So after escaping and killing Han Rey goes to Luke's and will only see Kylo two more time before the hutt scene where she literally puts on makeup and ships herself off in a box to him. Again we don't know what their memories they shared are and they have spent as much time fighting as talking. So she gets on the ship and both try to turn the other to their side and after another fight she refuses and Kylo starts negging her. Negging is where a man starts putting down a woman to make her feel like she needs his acceptance. Rey turns away from him and the darkside. So in two movies we are ""told"" their are feelings and a relationship but not really shown one or if we want to force the elevator and hut scene into romance not shown a healthy one. 

Then we get into TROS where Rey, per canon works, hasn't seen or spoken to Kylo in a year. And while in the movie and book and jr novelization of the movie it says she cares about him it never uses the word love. In fact the Jr novelization and The Star Wars Book and one other source I'm forgetting don't even mention the kiss. But even before the kiss we aren't shown them really having much of a relationship or banter. Its all both trying to turn the other to their side and fighting.

No maybe if Kylo was Rey's age or we got to see more of them together talking or something I would be able to buy into it. But their is so much saying they are in love and not showing it that it makes it hard for me to buy the intent as anything other than a much older darksider trying to turn and take advantage of this younger woman he has a mysterious connection to. 

So TLDR: Han and Leia have a equal amount of experience when it comes to romance and the galaxy and working while Kylo has a lot more than Rey in just about everything but emotional intelligence . Han and Leia also show us in three movies that they like bantering with each other and that while they bicker they really care about each other while Rey and Kylo are constantly trying to turn the other and fighting the other with Kylo acting in ways that feel abusive if they were together. 

Rey does care about him because of the connection they have and the memories but their is more than one kind of love. The Romans had eight different types of love and I think for Rey and Kylo it may have been one of the other seven than romantic love. So this is the reason I've come to on why I feel like their is a difference between the two groupings despite their age that isn't hypocritical"

\- Red matter from the first Kelvin Timeline movie.

Those are just the canon ones I can remember, but there must be a lot more (also non-canon)."
1,"If someone wanted to make a difference they could join starfleet and work their way up to the captain's chair.  And be saddled with a ton of ridiculous rules and regulations that make making a difference a lot more difficult . Or they could say to hell with that and build their own ship.  Go find an asteroid to mine and some place where you can find a lot of deuterium or antimatter.  Then find an isolated location and begin constructing your ship.  

Use holograms and robots for mining and construction.  So you could design and build a ship from scratch which would be difficult but possible if you have capable engineers working for you.  Or you could use an existing design.  It wouldn't even have to be big.  But it should be very heavily armed.    The defiant class shows just how many weapons you can put on a small ship.    And find a cloaking device if you can.  It will make space travel a lot less dangerous because you won't have to worry about hostile aliens as much. 

Once your ship has been built take it for a test drive to make sure there aren't any problems with it.  Then recruit a crew and head out into unexplored space.  Run a thorough background check on them to make sure there aren't any trouble makers or mutineers.  But plan for scenarios where the crew mutinies just in case.  But the do the best you can to recruit people you can trust.  

So then you have your own ship and your answerable to no one unless they out gun you.  See a planet that is about to be wiped out by a disaster.  Do something about it.  To hell with the prime directive.  See a planet where people are starving to death.  Give them food replicators.  What do you care you don't answer to starfleet command.  You don't have to explain yourself to some admiral.  

See a planet that has been conquered and is being oppressed.  If you have tactical and or technological superiority drive away their oppressors.  If not give the people replicators and let them arm themselves.  Again you don't answer to starfleet and you don't have to give a damn about the prime directive.

So if you really want to make a difference that is how you do it.  And you would be able to accomplish way more then most starfleet captains.  Because you don't have to follow a starfleet rule book.  So anyway let me know what you think in the comments."

0,"I know this has been done a lot before, but it is fun and I am pretty sure mine is the best one there will ever be. These are going to be mainly small changes and a sprinkle of larger ones. Please know the movie abbreviations, I will be using them a lot. In this post I will be only doing the TFA, and depending on how y'all like it, I will post the changes for the other two. Know that, unlike Disney, I have this whole thing planned out, and if something doesn't exactly make sense, I will most likely address it in a later date.

Ok first the TFA. This movie will have the fewest amount of changes, but it will be setting up the plot points in the next movies so it will feel like everything wasn't just being thrown in there last minute. First off, the First Order isn't going to be as big as it in the canon, I think it is far more realistic if the two sides are more evenly matched and it isn't a redo of the OT. Now, it will still be pretty goddamn ginormous, but they aren't the controlling force in the galaxy (yet). Everything will play along normally until the scene with Rey on Jakku. Ok, what I am going to do is simple, I will make Rey have the force, but like, from the beginning. She won't really understand it, she just knows its a power she has. And she will use it, when she is scavenging the fallen Star Destroyer she will be using the Force to look for some metal. She isn't going to be extremely powerful, just strong enough to use it with her in her every day life. I think this is believable, as kids having the force is normal until the Jedi Order takes them away, but since Jakku is nowhere, she wouldn't have been picked up by a Jedi. Then, when she sits down to have her food (before she meets BB8) she will see Kylo. Before I go on, I will be making her connection with Kylo a natural thing, not influenced by Snoke in any way. I think it is interesting having some mystery behind things, similar to the birth of Anakin Skywalker (until we find out later that some Squidward Sith was behind all of it). So, Rey and Kylo will see each other, it will be really brief. Kylo appears in front of her without any trace of traveling in the sand nor the Jakku sun upon him. And Rey will appear to Kylo sitting down in the middle of a hallway being strangely covered in a mystical desert glow. They will blink and check their eyes, then the next time they look, they will no longer be there. That is it, since they have no idea who the other person is, they will just assume they are hallucinating.

Then the story will go on until they meet Han and Chewy. First off, I'm removing the bit with Han and Chewie still being smugglers. They were war heroes for 30ish years, them having no change to themselves is makes no sense. Finn, Rey, Han and Chewie will be talking and Rey will passively force pull an apple to herself or something. Han will be mildly surprised and Rey will ask why. Han recognizes the force and knows what it is, but he doesn't really understand it. He will give his best shot of explaining the force to Rey but the explanation will be pretty awful. The story goes on until the First Order appear at Maz's palace place. There will only be some minor tweaks here but Kylo will use the force to locate Rey, who is in that jungle. Then, he will go completely berserk getting himself there. This will be my moment to show the Kylo is actually pretty strong. He will be doing flips with his saber, summoning lightning from the sky kinda like Thor, and maybe shooting fire out of his palms, I don't know. I want to have some new force powers. It gets kinda dull when the force can only do really specific things.

They story goes on until Kylo interrogates Rey. Kylo will look into her mind, then he goes deep trying to find the specific moment of her looking at the map to Skywalker. But then suddenly, he realises this isn't her mind anymore, it is his. Their connection is somehow reflecting their minds. And Kylo is looking back on his own memories. Maybe him being taught to handle a saber, Chewie teaching him to fly, or C3PO reading him a book or something. Then he will snap and stutter back. I think it is pretty stupid they Rey can reflect Kylo without any training, him being reflected by a mysterious power is much more believable. Then he will go to Snoke and ask him about it. Snoke will say, ""Even after countless millennia, no one *truly* knows anything about the force. Some say, it has a will. Mysterious things happen my young apprentice, such as the fabled birth, of Darth Vader (imperial march plays in the background). If what you say is true, then this girl may be dangerous to our cause. Bring her to me.""

The story continues until Kylo vs. Finn and Rey. I had the scene with Kylo being OP because I needed a scene with him being powerful, this won't exactly be that. First off, Kylo is going to do the same military tactic of punching himself to relieve his wound. But he will still suffer from it. Kylo will knock out Rey and battle Finn. Kylo does a twist-off a disarms Finn of the lightsaber, he brings his saber down, but this time, Finn jumps back and dodges it. Kylo knowing he is slow and wounded doesn't try to walk up and kill Finn, instead, he puts out a hand, and shoots out lightning. But this will be slow, less-powerful, torture focused lightning. Kylo yells ""TRAITOR"" as Finn is getting shocked. But then, the lightsaber will come out of the snow, interrupt the flow of lightning and come into Rey's hands, like in the original. Kylo and Rey will fight as they normally do, until the point where Rey chops up Kylo. I think it is silly knowing that an un-trained Rey can beat an experienced swordsman, handicapped or not. Instead, Rey takes two steps back, and channels all of her energy into her palms, and unleashes a powerful push with the force. Kylo is lifted off his feat and falls back, giving time for Rey to take Finn back to the Falcon, where they then assist the resistance in blowing up ~~the Death Star~~ Starkiller base. Rey will then go with Chewie and R2 to find the legend that is Luke Skywalker, war hero, beacon of hope, and Jedi grandmaster.

That concludes my changes to TFA. What we have done is establish the connection between Rey and Kylo, make Snoke sound smart, establish that Rey isn't a Mary Sue, and establish that Kylo is indeed a powerful foe. Hope y'all enjoy."
0,So all I’ve heard is that she’s going to be playing a Jedi that’s apparently more powerful than Vader....just when I thought Disney had redeemed themselves this comes out smh. Is this true?
1,I saw a post somewhere sometime that had one of those weird chains of events like how the width of the rocket that went to the moon was based on the width of the Roman chariot. And it had something to do with like one of the characters from ST getting divorced and it led to like Obama getting elected or something. Anybody know about this and can send me in the right direction? Thanks so much!

1,"Seth MacFarlane wanted to do a Trek series but CBS turned him down so he went off and did his own thing and The Orville brought back a lot of the positive/optimistic future vibes you got from TNG that were very much missing in Discovery/Picard. 

Do you think Lower Decks is a response to this since its going back to the TNG roots of being a positive/optimistic show?"
1,"I just finished a rewatch of Season 1. I kinda always forget about this season since all the episodes I really remember are Season 4 onward. 

I am one of those that's a little harsh on Voyager, but I confess, Season 1 is actually much better than I remember. There's great character development stuff and they were laying a strong groundwork for story arcs. I would say it had the best first season of the Star Trek shows of the era (against TNG, DS9, and ENT). Only two episodes really stand out as bad IMO: 

Time and Again: It was too early in the series for a ""reset the timeline to erase the story"" episode. I'm not a huge fan of those anyway. 

Learning Curve: A meh episode on its own, but made even worse by not being season finale material. DS9's In the Hands of the Prophets did a much better job of bringing a conflict between two crews to a head. 

Anyway, not looking forward to season 2. I was scrubbing through the episode titles and realized almost every episode that's regarded as infamously bad is in that season (Maneuvers, Elogium, Threshold, etc.)."

1,Ive noticed a few recurring casts in most of the star trek series and id love to know if theres a list of them as when i do notice them i cant always confirm it as they might not be listed on imdb and im not one for reading the credits
0,"1: The Mandalorian

2: The Phantom Menace

3: Attack of the Clones

4: Clone Wars Movie

5: Clone Wars (Season 1 to Season 7 Episode 9)

6: Revenge of the Sith

7: Clone Wars (Season 7 Episode 10 to 12)

8: Solo

9: Select episodes of Star Wars Rebels (I'm thinking about 15 of the most important ones)

10: Rogue One

11: A New Hope

12: The Empire Strikes Back

13: Return of the Jedi

14: The Force Awakens

15: The Last Jedi

16: The Rise of Skywalker

 The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, The Bad Batch and Kenobi will all be included as well once they are released. This is basically chronological order but with The Mandalorian starting the show for her. My thinking is, most people seem to get into Star Wars now by seeing Mando/Grogu and it is the most likely way she'll get into Star Wars. After that, she may be curious to know the story leading up to The Mandalorian and I think it would be best to start from the beginning. Release Order doesn't matter because she knows ""I am your father"" so there is no real surprise there. I think ROTS will be a million times more meaningful to her if she sees the Clone Wars first. What do you guys think of this order?"

0,Some friends of mine said that and I totally disagree. I'd be interested in some of your opinions and arguments.
1,"Have you ever noticed the inconsistent level of technology in Star Trek? I mean, this is an era where they have transporters,replicators, and starships that can travel trillions of miles an hour, yet people still use an elevator to get everywhere - on the Enterprise, on DS9, anywhere.  (And speaking of which, have you ever noticed the turbolift on DS9?  What a piece of crap!) ST features shields, force fields, magnetic sealing, yet no one in Starfleet has ever thought of the idea of body armor.  Like I said, inconsistent use of technology."
1,I have always wanted one just so I could live through my depraved fanstays
0,"Let’s start off by stating some facts before we get into this. There is no doubt the new Star Wars Disney movies are an embarrassment to all things holy in the Star Wars universe. I’m not even that die hard of a Star Wars guy but I truly feel for you loyalist cause those movies were utter nonsense. 
Now a statement needs to be made that may sound off but is true, the new Star Wars films are more like the ones of the past than the prequels. More adventure type of films, slow battles, entering a new story. It is important to note that the battles, and lightsaber duels specifically were so bad it felt like I was watching the old films from the 70’s, but at least those films had some emotional weight where I actually gave a fuck. 

Now onto the prequels...scratch that onto Revenge of the Sith. Don’t get me wrong, I hail the prequels, they had some classic moments. The pod race, the duel between Darth Maul and Obi Wan and Qui Gon Jinn, that duel was epic on another level and introduced lightsaber battles in a whole new way. However let’s be real the movie of all Star Wars movies is Revenge of the Sith. Usually in great movies you get maybe one or two 20 minute moments of awesome acting, cinematography, music, action and drama all in one scene. In ROTS you get the whole movie. Beginning seen when they look for grievous and you get your favorite duo together, which ends in a battle with COUNT DOOKU. Than they split off and have there own side quests, one fights another BOSS and anakin fights the BOSS OF BOSSES. Than we have the order 66 scene which honestly could be in top 5 scenes in all the movies in history of Star Wars. And from there we have high level, fate of the universe drama, oh I forgot to mention Yoda fighting a war on Kashyyyk. And that’s not even the best parts, than we have the duels of all duels that still haven’t even been touched by any other duels between Anakin and Obi Wan, plus a side duel between Yoda and Darth Sidious. It is the ultimate watch, ultimate everything. The old movies were boring, good story, but ultimately very boring. Truth is truth."
1,"You get top five and an honorable mention, the honorable mention is meant for a personal favorite. Remember, Captains not included.

The sequels weren't even that bad, man! It has some major problems, but you guys are blinded by sexism and hate.

  I don't want to see *any* arguments in this thread, but do others agree?"
1,"Explorers.  The federation is a military not an exploratory force.

Sorry to say it but with the federation having the best ships for combat.  Having defeated the professional warriors the Klingons.  You can only admit the Federation not only is an Military force but even better at deception than the Romulans and better at assimilation than the Borg.  

I don't understand the shift in understanding from the TOS to TNG where the combat aspect of the federation got replaced with the lie of exploration.  

Starships are not designed for exploration they are designed for war and typically come out on top of the Klingons.  In all the shows with Klingons the federation wins and the Klingons look like explorers.  

Why is the show unable to tell the truth?

Look at the borg they get out teched by the federation time and time again.  The federation has the most number of aliens more than the borg and access to the most technology in the galaxy compared to the borg.  Who's the most aggressive in start trek the Federation.  The Federation is a Conqueror."

 Out of the way of most of the crew based weapons stations and such.

1,"Garak should’ve been in the Take Me Out to the Holosuite “baseball” episode as the designer of the DS9 Nines baseball team uniforms. Additionally, Garak should have been the ringer in the episode and pulled a Tonya Harding."
1,"When you think of a Klingon, what it means to be, act and look like a true Klingon, who comes to mind?

I imagine some might immediately think of Worf, since he studied and learned all there was about his culture. But to me, he's a bit too text book.... Book smart but not street smart, so to speak. Yes he can fight and he knows heritage and customs, but as shown in various episodes, he seems to expect other Klingons to be the same as himself. Like, I'm Irish Canadian. If I went to Ireland and tried to act Irish or have my own expectations, I'm sure they'd beat the crap out of me.

Anywho, in my view, I'm kind of tossed up between Gowron, Kurn or Martok. All three seem to be true Klingons, but in different ways with different faults.

Who would you pick?

Oh, and Quark doesn't count. Sorry."
1,"I'm on my first watch through of DS9 (and loving it so far) and am working my way thru season 2.  Was watching Blood Oath and it dawned on me that I recognized the voices of the three Klingons (Kor, Kang, and Koloth) in the episode.  My first love is and always be TOS and I was absolutely floored when I realized that all three were reprising their characters from TOS!  Just yet another reason why DS9 has quickly jumped all the way up to my second favorite series behind TOS (still haven't watched VOY or PIC yet, those will be next).

I know it's probably not that big a deal to some, but I just thought it was extremely cool for them to use existing characters from TOS and actually getting the original actors to portray them again in DS9.  It also made me sad though when I realized all three have since passed on.  Hard to believe the series is getting close to 30 years old now.

Can't wait to watch the rest of the series and see what else it has in store."

He was always visibly pained and annoyed by everything and everyone around him, in uniform. 

He only drank prune juice, in uniform.

He was super impulsive, to the point of violent belligerence, in uniform.

He only came alive when he did Klingon stuff - he only smiled - when he'd been drinking, or thinking about drinking."

1. Thrawn 
2. Heir to the empire
3. Dark force rising

I have seen through reviews that people enjoyed Thrawn origin story but not so much the next two books. So I'm think ready Thrawn first for his origin story, then the first trilogy."

I've bought pretty much all the Ron Jones albums but can't find that any Dennis McCarthy-composed music was ever released other than the Encounter at Farpoint album. He's got some good songs (especially the four-note Enterprise motif that was used a lot in Seasons 2 and 3), so I'd love to find a place to listen to his music. Any tips on where to find it?"

1,"OK here we go

 There is a presidential election between a candidate who is more of a supporter of democracy versus one who's far more authoritarian in nature. The candidate in support of a more democratic approach is accused of sexual harassment by someone which could indeed hurt his or her chances of getting elected against the more authoritarian candidate. This is a situation where I can't help but think that if that accusation caused the one candidate to withdraw that could lead to the more authoritarian candidate getting elected and this authoritarian candidate has a very poor record in regards to women's right in contrast to the one accused of sexual harassment and is even proposing a ""Proof law""  that could make it harder for someone to file charges of sexual harassment against their employers. So while the democratic candidate withdrawing or being brought to Justice would indeed bring Justice to the alleged victim, in the end it could end up being far more harmful to other people in the future  who are sexually harassed or abused in a work setting

 I really hope that my scenario  I painted  didn't come across as a condemnation or a critique of the MeToo  movement but it just gives you something to think about.

Your thoughts?"
1,"As we know, the runs of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), Deep Space Nine (DS9), and Voyager overlapped within the same timeframe. If one's intent is to watch them all, the viewer has several options:

* By release date -- this is the way we watched them fresh -- if you want to experience life in the 1990s, this may be for you.

* Chronologically -- the guys at the [Star Trek Chronology Project](https://thestartrekchronologyproject.blogspot.com/) have done a great job of putting together an order.

* Watch all of TNG, then all of DS9, then all of Voyager -- great if you dislike jumping around between series.

* Randomly; whatever happens to be on -- most of the episodes are reasonably self-contained, and so picking it up anywhere is not a bad thing.

I've been thinking of another alternative -- an order that preserves the chronology and avoids spoilers while not jumping around too much between series.

I've been bingeing *Stargate* recently, and this franchise likewise has series that overlap: SG-1 and Atlantis, with the same discussions about watching orders. In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/dllw8/the_official_rstargate_what_order_do_i_watch/c113muu/) u/rinnieangel puts forth such an order, and so far in my progress, it's pretty good. So, inspired by that and with u/GoldenSandslash15 's excellent notes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/mq7njk/interleaving_tng_ds9_vog_by_stardate/gueajr3/) I'll propose this watch order for the TNG/DS9/VOY run:

* TNG 1.01 - 6.11

* DS9 1.01 - 1.20

* TNG 6.12 - 7.01

* DS9 2.01 - 2.19

* TNG 7.02 - 7.20

* DS9 2.20 - 2.26

* TNG 7.21 - 7.26

* DS9 3.01 - 3.12

* Star Trek: Generations

* VOY 1.01 - 1.16

* DS9 3.13 - 3.26

* VOY 2.01 - 2.12

* DS9 4.01 - 4.10

* VOY 2.13 - 3.01

* DS9 4.11 - 4.26

* Star Trek: First Contact

* VOY 3.02 - 3.12

* DS9 5.01 - 5.16

* VOY 3.13 - 4.01

* DS9 5.17 - 5.26

* VOY 4.02 - 4.14

* DS9 6.01 - 6.19

* VOY 4.15 - 4.26

* DS9 6.20 - 7.03

* VOY 5.01 - 5.16

* DS9 7.04 - 7.10

* Star Trek: Insurrection

* VOY 5.17 - 6.01

* DS9 7.11 - 7.26

* VOY 6.02 - VOY 7.26

* Star Trek: Nemesis

I tried to keep each ""chunk"" equal to about half a season, making sure not to break up two-parters and keeping crossovers in the appropriate chronology. I think there is room for optimization, and so any comments -- and in particular, error corrections -- are welcome.

I do want to emphasize that I do not consider this or any other order optimal or prescriptive -- ultimately, watch what you like, when you like.

A graphical version of this ordering including other Trek series is available here:

1,"Big Star Trek fan, and overall have been really happy with the new shows (DISCO, PIC, and LOWER DECKS).  Regarding DISCO, there are two points in particular I do not necessarily NOT like about the show, but it seems these points indicate that two ways, DISCO runs counter to previous Star Trek shows:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Too complex for my son to watch.**  I grew up watching TOS in syndication in elementary school, and I loved the show.  It became one of the shows that my mother and I used to watch together.  Now, I have a nine year-old son, and I think the story archs of DISCO are too complicated for him to follow.  I've watched episodes of TOS, TRAINING, and DS9 with him, with no problem in comprehension.  Either the DISCO producers missed the point that Star Trek has traditionally be a family-friendly(ish) show, one that parents and their children can watch together, OR they've deliberately made DISCO more complex to target an older, more **sophisticated** demographic.  Yes, I have watched DISCO with my son, and he likes it, but I think he is responding more to the visual effects and quicker-paced editing than to the plot.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Star Trek is about the team; DISCO is about Michael Burnam.**   Star Trek is basically ""e pluribus unam"" in space.  TNG is a perfect example: Different combinations of characters are able to solve different types of problems.  Yes, they are lead by a singular captain, but all the various characters are very competent, and the writers end up writing for different combinations of characters.  When different situations arise, different characters--who have been developed over time--assemble together to solve the problem.  DISCO, in nearly all three seasons, is about Michael Burnam, to the detriment of almost all the other characters.  Yes, some characters have have been developed, but I would argue only a few, and the rest have been woefully ignored.  As an example, when the bridge crew was fighting to retake the ship toward the end of S03, how many of the regular, reoccurring characters that were participating in the retake could you name? Other than Tilly.  And of those that you could name, could you describe their personalities as easily as you could the TNG characters after the end of TNG S03?  Like I said in my first point, above, this may have been a deliberate move on behalf of the producers, to produce a show with a more strongly-developed main character, in contrast to the shows (TOS, TNG, etc.) that came before.

&amp;#x200B;

If these are deliberate experiments, I don't mind.  If it is the result of sloppy writing or poor design, then that is something altogether different.  Thanks for reading."
1,Thanks
0,"I'm thinking he could have defeated either of them handily in a saber battle. He killed Jedi masters easily In the past. He just had so many opportunities to kill them. He froze them at one point, which gave him enough time to cut their heads off with his lightsaber, but he didn't. Hell, he was basically a god. All his manipulation and life extension technology, and he end up getting killed off permanently by his own lightning. That's kinda dumb."
1,Same as the reaction to people about DISCO/reboot klingons?
0,"I am not a fan of the Prequels or the Sequels however I do like the Clone Wars show (both of them) and can appreciate the prequels' contributions to the canon and the amazing idea and story that Lucas was attempting to bring to the big screen but it ultimately failed in execution.

The sequels, on the other hand, there are very few things I like about them. The cinematography can be pretty good at times and Adam driver/ kylo ren was pretty good occassionally. Also Oscar Issac was pretty charasmatic sometimes. That's it. Bad characters, half assed character arcs, Terrible characters, no direction, social politics interfering with the story, bad writing, etc. These *are* bad movies and yet so many people like them. Why is that?

I think people who like the sequels, blindly and unconditionally love Star Wars. So much so that they are willing to consume any Star wars media no matter the form or quality and like it.

Sequel fans are either unwilling or unable to examine these films critically."
1,I was rewatching voyager as is my yearly tradition. In the pilot episode when we first see Janeway on voyager her cup is half full of what looks like a (pardon my Canadian) double-double. Her coffee is far from black.
0,"I know it's just a meme, but it would literally explode the fanbase in my opinion. What would you imagine the first few scenes being?"
1,Wow. Out of all the places to be. Strange New Worlds is to be filmed in Mississauga where I work (live on the border of it with Toronto) which I think is pretty amazing! Makes me even more excited. Honestly I am more excited for this show than Discovery or Picard. Pike is the best!
1,In a thousand years how will bajorans remember sisko.  Will they say he walked on water.  Will they say he turned water into wine.  Will they say that he was without sin (yeah right.  He poisoned a planet and  tricked the romulans into a war).  Will they await his second coming.   It sounds familiar doesn't it.  So was sisko space jesus?  And is that how the bajorans will remember him?
1,"I'm guessing someone said this before but here goes. I think the voyager ship at the end is actually the next copies from the demon planet. If the original crew left why wouldn't the silver blood make more now it has the DNA patterns. This crew would again wish to get home to Earth. So on their way they see the returning ship disintegrating. I like this thought as it means that it is a continuing cycle for them so the course is always oblivion. 
Also it makes more sense than the actual real voyager still being only a week away from the demon planet."
1,"The FX company sent this to me the other day and I thought you might enjoy it as it is a solid look at how they did some of the visual effects for last season.

1,"So I've recently got into Star trek after watching Discovery and now I'm working my way through Enterprise and I keep falling deeper in love with the universe as I do so.

It got me wondering why there doesn't seem to be any series or movies set around 2063 and the invention of the warp drive.
I feel like seeing humanity's first contact with the Vulcans would be pretty cool if done right and it's a shame we haven't yet.

Thoughts?"
0,"I recently saw that there is this huge still not released one, but i was thinking about buying the older ones and I dont know if the skywalker saga is some sort of remake. so, is it still gonna be worth it to get the older ones even with this new one?"
1,"I did a post in a DS9 thread regarding the ages of characters as they appeared in the show, and as a result of popular demand I thought I'd do this for the other shows as well, so here goes:

**Deep Space Nine**

Bashir was 27 when DS9 started, Worf was 32 when he joined the crew, Odo was found 35 years prior to DS9, Jadzia was 28 when DS9 started, Sisko was 37 when DS9 started, O'Brien was 41 when DS9 started, the Dax symbiont is 346 when DS9 started, Kira Nerys was 26 when DS9 started.

Quark is harder as he has no official birth date, but we know that his Age of Ascension was 2351. We also don't know when Ferengi reach their Age of Ascension, but Nog tried to purchase his apprenticeship in Starfleet when he was 18, so let's assume it's roughly then. That means his date of birth is about 2333, meaning he's about 36.

**The Next Generation**

Picard is 59 when TNG starts, Riker is 29 when TNG starts, it is 26 years since Data's activation date when TNG starts, Troi is 28 when TNG starts, Tasha Yar is 27 when TNG starts, Worf is 24 when TNG starts, Geordi is 29 when TNG starts, Beverley Crusher is 40 when TNG starts, Wesley Crusher is 16 when TNG starts, Guinan is roughly 514 when TNG starts

**Voyager**

Janeway is 43 when VOY starts, Chakotay is 42 when VOY starts, Tom Paris is about 29 when VOY starts,  B'Elanna Torres is 25 when VOY starts, Seven of Nine is 24 when she is liberated in VOY, Tuvok is 107 when VOY starts, The Doctor is &lt;1 when VOY starts, Kes is 2 when VOY starts, Harry Kim is 22 when VOY starts"
0,"I'm just finishing watching the 9 movies for the first time ( only the 9th episode left ). What's some good star wars content. I know that the Mandalorian and (some) games  are good but not much more that that. 

Is the clone wars animated series good?"
0,"I have tried to make a road map for the upcoming Star Wars shows on Disney+, and Rogue Squadron. To do this I've collected the information we know, and made a couple of assumptions and figured out something that I think s at least close to what their release plan might be for the next few years. First I will list off a couple of my assumptions.

1. I assume ""The Bad Batch"" is 22 episodes. Kevin Keiner said on the Full of Sith Podcast that he had finished scoring episode 14. I first assumed we would get 12 episodes to match the last season of the Clone Wars, but him mentioning episode 14 makes me believe we will get a full 22 season.
2. I'm also assuming the first episode of ""The Bad Batch"" (being 70 minutes long) are three episodes put together. If each episode is around 22 minutes it makes sense that three is around 66 minutes (which is close to 70 minutes). This means that episode 2 airing May 7th is actually the fourth episode.
3. Between each show we will have one week off where we're getting a ""making of"" or a featurette or something like that. This assumption lines up with how Marvel does it, and I guess Disney would like the same for Star Wars. So I do think from May 4th this year we are getting something Star Wars (close to) every week.
4. No Star Wars show will overlap until at least 2023. This is just a hunch based on how many shows that are now in production. During or after 2023 I think they might have to let shows overlap, at least animation and live-action.
5. I'm guessing ""A Droid Story"" is coming out this year. It just makes sense, and it filled a gap in my rundown that I felt needed to be filled.
6. The Book of Boba Fett will be 4 episodes. This is just based on a rumor, but that is the closest thing I have to concrete information about how many episodes the show will be, so I'm using that number in this rundown.
7. I'm guessing the other Mado-related shows will be 8 episodes to fit with The Mandalorian.
8. Ewan McGregor said in an interview with ""Men’s Journal"" in 2019 that Obi-Wan Kenobi will be 6 episodes, so I'm using that number. I've heard other rumors that it's 4 episodes, but I'm trusting the man himself more than other rumors.
9. TFA, Rogue One, TLJ and TRoS was released on the third Friday of December in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019. Given that Patty Jenkins Rogue Squadron will be released in December of 2023 I'm assuming it will release the third Friday of that December as well, making its release date, December 15, 2023.

Alright! So here I will list off my assumed release dates for all episodes in the shows.

The Acolyte 101?		June 2, 2023

&amp;#x200B;

(Here we have too little information about how many episodes and which show will be released first. I'm guessing The Acolyte comes next, but I have no real information about this. We also don't know how many episodes The Acolyte will be, and all the non-Mando related shows have different lengths so far. So this is all I have until Rogue Squadron).

&amp;#x200B;

Rogue Squadron		December 15, 2023

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I have gathered. Because much of this is based on little information and just my assumptions I may be off to some degree, but I think this is close to their release plan for the next few years if all goes according to plan. Based on this rundown Obi-Wan will be released so close to May 4th that I really wanted that to line up, but unless The Making of Andor is two episodes or something like that I couldn't really get that to work. We'll see. What do you guys think?"

My hope is if they see enough people rewatch DS9 we might get a spin off."

0,"First of all, I am a relatively new Star Wars fan. I watched the prequels shortly after they we're released on DVD, but didn't really enjoy them.

What got me interested in the universe was definintely The Mandalorian. After the show, i wanted to learn more about all the characters. So i watched the prequels, sequels, and even the animated Clone Wars show. And i gotta say that they work really well as a cohesive story.

While I still had my problems with the prequel trilogy, especially the dialogue, the overall story is great and ""The Clone Wars"" expands on it brilliantly.

But when i then got to episode 7 all my excitement died. It became very obvoius that the Director was afraid of taking any risks. There are Rebels again? There is another planet destroying weapon being built? The third fucking time in three movies?
Out protagonist is living on a desert planet unaware of her powers? Wow, so original.

At this point i wasn't looking forward to Episode 8, but i continued regardless. And what the fuck was that?
They obvoiusly tried to course-correct and take the franchise in another direction, but the execution was laughably bad. I didn't mind grumpy Luke as much, but they should have explained it better. Luke wanting to slaughter his nephew in his sleep was a bit extreme. I don't buy it. 
Don't get me started on the ""this is how we win"" stuff at the end of that movie. Complete garbage.

And i don't even want to talk about episode 9. That shit felt like a fever-dream. 

The Disney movies just don't work in the  context of the other movies and i dislike them individually, too.
Sure the writing might be better than the Prequel Trilogy, but the overall story is awful.

I had the luxury to watch all the movies back to back.
If i had waited years for new Star Wars content only to be presented with this crap, i would be so disappointed. Yet, when i came here to talk about my experience, i found that most people here defend the Disney Trilogy and especially The Last Jedi, which is mind-boggling to me.

If you had fun with the Disney Trilogy, then i don't want to tell you that you are wrong. In the end, it is all subjective, but i don't understand how most of you are not massively disappointed. Star Wars with todays technology could have been amazing, yet the movies are at best mediocre."
0,"Is there anyway we can get the man Mark Hamil to host saturday night live? He is a great comedic actor and is a legend.

1,"Not sure if this is allowed here, but I recently picked up a PC game that I suspect any Trekkie / Trekker gamers would enjoy too. It's called Starcom: Nexus, and it's really cool! it's in that nameless genre of ""you're a person with a tiny space ship set loose in a big galaxy, and you can pursue a career being a trader, or pirate, or take sides in interstellar wars, or whatever you want, all while exploring and customizing your ship."" If you're an oldschool gamer, you could think of this as a modernized version of Star Control, or StarFlight, or (if you were a Mac gamer in the 90's) like the Escape Velocity series.

It's not technically a Star Trek game but it's got a *serious* Trek vibe throughout, both in the aesthetic and in a lot of the things that you might find as you scan random planets or encounter various aliens throughout the galaxy. It's definitely the kind of game where you can be hyper focused on it, micro managing everything... or you can just pick a direction in space and turn on the auto pilot and let the ship fly itself for an hour (which can be helpful at times, since it'll start to fill in the *enormous* map). Anyway, I bought it on Good Old Games (gog.com) and it's also available on other platforms like Steam. I hope you guys enjoy this too!

0,Of all the stormtrooper deaths this one in ROTJ is my favorite.  I always appreciate a fall from some non OSHA approved bridge or one getting blasted at Cloud City as soon as the door opens.  Which one is your favorite?
0,"Was it a retcon? Yea but it actually made the OT better.

Anakin WAS the chosen one who would bring balance to the force and defeat the sith for all time in ROTJ, buuuut just like most prophecies it is true but the path there isn't what you'd expect. This monkey paw prophecy has been an audience favorite since the beginning of time for a reason.

Incidentally the will of the force seemed to be wiping out the jedi and sith, and if Anakin had obeyed the jedi's no love and no attachments rule the sith would never have been defeated. Literally love of a child brought down Palpatine.

My headcanon doesn't acknowledge the events of TROS ;)"
1,"Grew up on all the TOS and TNG films. TNG was on TV while I was growing up and would watch an episode here and there. 

Last year I watched through all of TNG and loved it, I knew I would because I loved all the movies growing up. 

Anyway, I'm working on DS9 now. My initial thoughts. 

First of all, I think this show starts off a lot stronger than TNG. I'm up to episode 19 and very few episodes have been bad, compared to how rough the first couple seasons of TNG was. 

Commander Sisko - the first episode, I felt like the actor was trying too hard ? I'm sure he was under a lot of pressure being the next Captain after Picard. 

I'm sure Avery Brooks is a qualified actor but I'm waiting for something to happen with Sisko. So far I like that he's a good father and we are shown a lot of Sisko and Jake. There's also his previous relationship with Dax I guess and he's the ""Chosen One"" which I can never stand in any show but whatever. His relationship with Kira has it's interesting moments. I'm still waiting for him to grab me I guess. 

Kira - good actress, some interesting moments of where her loyalties lie.

Dax - Jesus Christ is she beautiful, it's distracting how attractive she is. Her previous lives and past friendship with Sisko is interesting I guess but I don't feel like they use her much. They keep talking about how great she is and how important she is but I feel like they aren't showing why. 

Odo and Quark - love both their characters and their relationship. I dunno if either of them will have anything more to do outside of what they currently are. 

Dr. Bashir - meh he is what he is. 

Jake - way more likable than Wesley lol I don't know what they'll do with him though. 

O'Brien - I like O'Brien and I feel like they could do more with him. Why is he such a low rank? Lol he's the chief engineer of the space station and he has 1 empty rank? 

Nog - I watched a bunch of Nog clips on youtube and it's kind of what got me started watching every episode, his arc is great and I think the actor did a great job. I wish we could of gotten Captain Nog somehow. 

I like that the show is on a space station with people coming and going. One thing that I've noticed is everyone is pretty low rank which I find interesting. There's this space station right beside this important worm hole and it's crewed by a low ranking ramshackle crew. 

Over the years of having DS9 on my to do list I've wikid it so I kind of know about Worf showing up eventually/The Dominion War and the ending kind of. 

I've heard that the Villain Gul Dukat is great and I'm waiting for him to show up. I wasn't impressed by the Cardassians in TNG so I'm excited that they are a big part of DS9 and can't wait to see how it all turns out."
0,"Or Disney Plus, I should say.

Are there any films in production? Or just shows for D+?"
0,"Why include Luke Han or Leia, if the story would intentionally crap on them, *so they don't outshine some new characters?* Why did they not preserve their legacy and make the sequels skip ahead 200 or w/e years? Why'd the New Republic and New Jedi die before they were even in the story?

Why include the OT crew in the story, if the OT crew literally all die as miserable failures? The events of the movies just taking the biggest dump on them until they've completely failed and only Rey can fix everything. Was everything actually just filler, waiting for Rey?"
1,"The USS Hera, the ship commanded by Geordi's mom, which went missing and was never found, was actually one of the first ships abducted by the Caretaker. While everyone focuses on Voyager's journey and subsequent return, the Hera is still on her way back to the Alpha Quadrant."
1," A few things from Memory Alpha:

* According to the paperwork with the [Bandai](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bandai) model kit, the *Enterprise*\-A was mothballed into [Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Alpha)'s museum fleet. Scott's comments in ""[Relics](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Relics_(episode))"" would seem to support this.
* In the comic ""[TNG Special 3](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/TNG_Special_3)"", the *Enterprise*\-A was on display at Starbase 122's Starfleet museum in   
2369 where it was visited by Scott after his rescue from the Dyson Sphere in ""[Relics](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Relics_(episode))"".

From Wikipedia:

\- ""There is no [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(Star_Trek)) information about the ship's fate beyond *Star Trek VI*. In the epilogue of [*Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_VI:_The_Undiscovered_Country), Uhura had stated they received a communication from [Starfleet Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet#Starfleet_Command) that ordered *Enterprise* to report to space dock to be decommissioned. However, she may have been speaking only of the ship's original crew members as [Captain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(Star_Trek)) [James T. Kirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk) previously stated his crew was due to stand down in three months, while [Spock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock) noted this would be his last voyage on *Enterprise* as a member of her crew; and Captain Kirk states in his closing log entry the ship ""will become the care of another crew,"" but no further information is given. 

There is the theory that the A was put into the emergency response fleet at Wolf 359, but the evidence for that is pretty fuzzy.

It might be a stretch, but, with all the possibilities open with Trek these days, man, it sure would be fun to see the old bucket of bolts make a real appearance once more. The door to that seems to be left open. Who knows, maybe someone from Paramount reads these threads. Maybe a certain bald ex-Captain/Admiral needs a ship again for an emergency mission. Maybe we all get to see her once more?"
0,"Does anyone else get irrationally annoyed at how John William's track titles are not in chronological order of each film's story?  

Like 'Duel of the Fates' being the second track on the Phantom Menace soundtrack. Or 'Grievous Speaks to Lord Sidious' inexplicably placed between 'The Immolation Scene' and 'The Birth of the Twins and Padmé's Destiny'.  

It just bugs me so much, and it's too much of a hassle to skip around tracks manually so I just leave it alone lol. (also does anyone remember the controversy back in '99 when people got spoiled by the Phantom Menace soundtrack? Mostly because news channels kept reporting on it lol. Good times)  

Anyway, what's your favourite SW soundtrack? Today I'm listening to the prequels, Rogue One and Solo for the first time.  

Last night I rewatched ROTS for the first time since its release, and I think John Williams did all the heavy lifting in that movie (followed immediately by Ian McDiarmid!).  

As for my favourite, I can't decide until I listen to all of them, but I suspect ESB will remain my favourite. It's just too iconic."
0,"While me and my partner have no intention of having children anytime soon, I have recently been introducing her to our lovely little cult of quirky space movies, and she has been enjoying it so far! 

With this, I began to wonder about the future. Obviously me and her will discuss it ourselves, but I wanted to see what your guys’ experiences were! 

How young is too young to get them into it? Do you give them an option, or just sit them down and start it, hoping they won’t hate it? 

And, what’s it like having your child dislike it? Do you hope they’ll come around eventually? Or have you accepted it? 

Would love to hear your experiences with this. Thank you for commenting!"
1,"I’m trying to watch this series again. 
I just finished Enterprise which I didn’t like at all when it first came out, but which I actually enjoyed on a rewatch. I’m trying the same thing with DS9. Same story - I found it too boring and too religion-based on my first try but so far i think it’s ok (only on episode 11 so far though). 
But could someone explain Odo’s ability to me? He just changed into a glass, which was carried on a tray into a different area. How can this be? Odo has a body mass much much greater than a simple glass and even if he was able to compress it down into something so small, it should still have the weight of a being of Odo’s size. Basically, he should follow the same rules that the T-1000 had to follow in T2."

1,"on a Star Trek kick again.   so I just watched Home Soil, and by God if this isn't one of the best episodes of Star Trek across any platform I don't know what is!!  
It is the heart of startrek!!   It is the episode where data finds inorganic life on a terraforming world and the crew has to find out how to communicate with it and make peace.  It is basically captain Picards monolog intro to the show made into an episode.  Amazing episode.  Episodes like this are why I am such a fan!!"
1,"James Doohan was a WW2 vet and lost his right middle finger storming the Normandy beaches. As such, the actor was very careful not to show his right hand clearly on screen, either hiding it with props and positioning or using hand doubles for close-up shots.

However, there are scenes in which the old wound can be seen (Troubles with Tribbles while holding an armful of the woolly scamps), and from Star Trek V on he stopped hiding it altogether (watch his hand while he's flirting with Uhura on the bridge).

This means that, while never acknowledged, it is canon that Scotty routinely lost the same finger and had it regrown or replaced with advanced medical tech.

I imagine the interaction went something like this:

Scotty: ""Engineering to Sick Bay. Medical Emergency.""

Bones: ""Scotty, is it the finger again?""

Scotty: ""Aye, but the warp core's bein' a pernickety lass today.""

Bones: ""Dammit man, that's the eleventh finger this month. You don't have to be IN the engine to flip it the bird!""

Scotty: ""I do if I want her to see me do it."""

Would love to get a discord group together, we can even use it for the sim, explore different era's like Enterprise era, I think that would be pretty fun. Make some great friends in the process. I have a lot of plot ideas, high detail, long posts, pretty chill. So if anyone is interested."
1,"After finishing TOS , TNG ,DS9 and VOY, it got me thinking how come the Federation is considered to be a particularly huge power in the Alpha quadrant 

#1 The federation got whipped in the dominion war without the Klingon and Romulan alliance doesn't it look like they d be crushed ? 

#2 The Klingons were able to annex and control most of the Cardassian systems and put the cardassians on a severe retreat. Whereas the federation- cardassian war ended in a stale mate with a treaty and border exchange that caused more problems read Maquis.

#3 Last but not least in TNG episode 'Yesterdays Enterprise' Picard admits that the war with klingons was going bad and the federation is on the brink of a colossal defeat .

Given all this ,I am a little confused as how the Federation could possibly be a huge power , just a Klingon /Cardassian assault could cause more problems ,
Maybe I haven't grasped certain facts properly"
1,"In the DS9 season 2 finale Quark tells Commander Sisko that unlike humans, the Ferengi have no history of owning slaves. However, it was established earlier s2e7 that on the Ferengi homeworld the females aren't allowed to travel, earn profit or wear clothing. Isn't that slavery?"
1,"I love all of the time travel episodes so much. 

This episode “shockwave part 1” is first time travel episode story plot of enterprise that I’ve seen so far.

Honestly it’s just making my day."

They had chips implanted in them and would follow orders without hesitation even if it was weird and seemed wrong like killing the Jedi that were good to them and fought along side. While on the other side of the war, the separatists had armies of droids programmed to do things upon command, sure thats what they were built for and droids aren’t bad, they just do whatever is programmed said Kuiil from the Mandalorian.

But lots of great moments in the ep: Troi having to take command of the bridge and clashing with Ensign Ro; Worf delivering Keiko and O'Brien's baby(!); Picard trapped in the turbolift with the kids. I think that right there softened him up towards children, after being annoyed with Wesley so many times. The very end is one of my favorite moments, when Picard says, ""You have the bridge, Number One,"" both Marissa and Riker answer in unison, ""Aye sir!"", and Riker smiles at her.

0,"Seriously, Disney has owned Star Wars for nearly a decade now. At that point, fans had been begging George Lucas to release the original films that made him a success for years, without all the stupid CGI crap. Lucas continued to add things almost for spite, but now he's not even in control of the series anymore. Disney can do whatever they want with it, and what do they do? *Maclunkey.*

Meanwhile, Warner Bros. was more than willing to spend $50 million on a re-edit for their panned flop for no other purpose than to please fan outcry after just a couple years. Now Snyder fans are really happy! I've mocked them in the past but they got what they wanted, and they're satisfied. I'm more than happy for them.

There is nothing stopping Disney from doing the same thing with Star Wars. Actually even less is stopping them. They don't even have to DO anything! Just touch up on the visuals a little bit, and boom, you've got yourself the original Star Wars trilogy. It will hardly cost them anything, and it's basically a guaranteed success. If WB can satisfy fans with the original vision of a hack director, why can't Disney?

This is SUCH easy money and it's astounding to me that it wasn't their immediate decision when they bought it. Did ZSJL make any money? I have no idea, but I can sure as hell tell you that Unspecial Star Wars will make more.

1,"I recently watched *A Piece of the Action*, and it really exceeded my expectations. Going into the episode, I was expecting campy, stupid fun, with everyone dressing up in pinstripe suits and talking in bad 1920s slang. There is a lot of that, certainly. You can’t help but laugh at the way there are just pedestrians casually walking down the street with Tommy Guns everywhere. But what really got me was how well it works on an intellectual level.

You, see, despite the goofy premise, it actually has a solid theme: the importance of being able to adapt yourself to the worldviews of others and work within their system of values, no matter how strange they seem. Even though the fact that the Iotians almost border on cartoon villains, Kirk and Spock never talk to them. On the contrary, they constantly note how ingenious the Iotians are, and quickly realize that, in their way, they have an accurate diagnosis on what’s wrong in their society and how to fix it. While they initially have a difficult time understanding the Iotians inverted system of ethics, they don’t dismiss, but rather try to work within it to devise a solution that fits the Iotians cultural norms. This might seem like a bit of a broken aesop at first, since Kirk ends up strong arming the Iotians. But what he’s really doing is playing the game as they’d want it played.

In short, it’s a wonderful example of the show’s open minded philosophy.

My only regret is that nobody ever followed up on the stinger at the end, where they left a communicator behind and joked that the Iotians might use it to invent a warp drive. How great would it have been if the Iotians had shown up 100 years later at DS9 or something. I bet they would have been a lot of fun at Quark’s"

1,"A month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ljyopr/enterprise) about starting Enterprise. I was super butthurt about everything and frankly I should have taken more time to gather my thoughts after finishing DS9 before starting Enterprise.

I am part of many Star Trek groups and generally Enterprise gets a bad opinion. Though, the people in that post convinced me to continue. 

What an excellent series that was. I really only had one instance where I was disappointed (besides the finale not showing the speech) and that was the 2 episodes of the mirror universe. Even then, it was all right. Still better than TNG season 1. I will definitely miss spending time with that crew.

After finishing TNG, I really wanted to get my brother into Trek, but, he couldn't get passed the first few episodes and I dont blame him. Then I told him DS9 is more up his alley, but him spending 7 seasons on something that makes him think of season 1 TNG didnt really work.  With Enterprises production value, only 4 seasons (I wish it was 7) and lack of Gene Roddenberry (sorry Gene fans). I think I will finally get him into Trek.

Well, I'm going to take a week to process this series and then onto Voyager. I wont say Enterprise is my favorite series, but its a series I loved so much.

0,"I’m rewatching all of the Skywalker saga for the first time since before the sequel trilogy and am currently on Revenge of the Sith, which (controversial opinion) is actually a pretty good movie. It really starts to cook once Anakin turns. The dramatic irony of knowing what must transpire in these two hours for the saga to connect is really fascinating to me. The great tragedy of this story is Anakin’s belief that by joining the Sith, he’d gain the ability to save Padmé’s life. If he’d never turned to the Dark Side at all, she wouldn’t have died. His vision of the future was true, but only because he was always going to betray the Jedi. The very thing he hoped to accomplish with his new powers would not have been necessary at all had he not turned. Most Star Wars films end on a high note and I appreciate that this one was willing to go dark, no pun intended. The dialogue and some of the direction may have been terrible but it sure is a great story, a profound tragedy."

0,"Dooku - He tells Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Republic is under the control of a Dark Lord of the Sith, so he clearly knows.

Grievous - He has spoken with Darth Sidious, so he knows that another Sith Lord exists, but he often talks about killing Palpatine, so he probably doesn't know.

Mas Amedda - In the *The Clone Wars* series, Palpatine and Amedda talk about what they should do and Palpatine says that for now, they should let democracy prevail, which is very suggestive of Amedda knowing. Also, Amedda has a suspiciously nonchalant reaction when Palpatine reoooooooooooooooooganizes the Galactic Republic into the Galactic EMpaiuh and when he fights Yoda, so I think he knows.

Maul - Not sure about this one. He says that he did not realize what Sidious had in mind to take down the Jedi and the Republic (namely, Order 66) until the clones attacked Ahsoka. So he certainly didn't know the full details of *how* Sidious would achieve his goal. However, the fact that Maul instantly realizes that Sidious is behind the clones attacking Ahsoka seems to suggest something. I think if Sidious hadn't already told Maul who he was, Maul probably figured it out when then-Queen Amidala spoke for then-Senator Palpatine to call for a Vote of No Confidence and Palpatine ended up being elected Supreme Chancellor. So this is a maybe, but I'm leaning towards yes.

Sly Moore - We don't really know much about her in comparison to the others on this list, but I think she was, like Amedda, close enough to Palpatine that he told her his secret. But this is more speculation than anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Anakin is the first Jedi to learn of Palpatine's true identity.

&amp;#x200B;

Have I missed anyone or gotten something wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I haven't seen anyone mention them yet, but I think someone might, so I'll address the Kaminoans. I think that all they knew was this: after the death of Sifo-Dyas, a person named Tyranus (who they didn't know was Dooku) took over the production of the clone army. Tyranus introduced the inhibitor chip so that if a Jedi went rogue, the clones could be told to execute Order 66 and try to kill the Jedi (although it appears inhibitor chips were not necessary for Pong Krell because no one told those clones to execute Order 66). This Tyranus person told them that because the Jedi would probably be opposed to this, it should be kept a secret at all costs. So I don't think the Kaminoans actually knew who Sidious was or what the plan was."

At least with Janeway she gets a Dear John letter and finds out he's moved on.

1,"Note: this was originally created for u/shittyDaystrum  


We know that in some small way that the Mirror Universe is linked in some small way to Transporters. This can be seen throughout the entire canon series in some way from TOS, DS9, and my belief ENT.  The first objection is that we don't see the mirror universe connected to Transporters and that we see it connected through the Mirror Universe Tholians in the Capture of the Defiant. We are not explicitly told that this is in the mirror universe in TOS... so for the sake of argument lets put that whole idea aside.   


But didn't the Mirror Universe begin way before what happened to Hoshi? I mean, we see events that were much different in history that definitely preceded Hoshi and her life... This is what made even more sense of the Episode Vanishing Point to me.  Strictly speaking... not only did she go to another place while stuck in the transporter (or in the other universe). She also went back in time. We see that there is some ability to do that if the conditions are right with Transporters in the DS9 Episode Past Tense. In this theory, she went back millions of years (to a time period where the civilization that had been dead for millions of years to shatter point that she created.  This also explains why in the  ENT episode Exile  that she had a very different idea psychic feel about her.   


What is the Mirror Universe then?   


It is a universe that Hoshi created because of her special abilities that took her back in time and created a universe that could hold all of the things that she was not. Her fear, hate anguish, suffering.. and courage. Her counterpart was right to rule on the throne because Hoshi from the Standard Universe created it."

1,On season 5 of Voyager and I still can’t believe all the situations his been put through without promotion. He’s probably the most beat up character in any Trek series that I can think of. Poor guy. I know get the running jokes this sub has hahaha.

0,"Perhaps a strange post to make, but I just wanted to outline how much I love this particular game. I remember renting it in 2009 (back when that was a thing) for the Wii as a boy. And holy shit did I love it for the Wii. As I recall, I got over half the game done in one day. I know this too because my wrist the morning after was sore in a way I would not know again until I was a teenager; you could honestly have an aerobics class with this game alone. The graphics too (probably dated by this point) were very unique to the rest of the Star Wars universe at the time; quite realistic in a sense, perhaps even 'darker' (a sizable upgrade to the very great Battlefront 2 from 2005). I grew up with the prequels, and watched the original trilogy with my dad as a young boy before this game, so to have Starkiller directly link the two via the Rebellion was brilliant in my book. Even the final scene, which I’m sure many will find corny, I nevertheless loved:

&gt;Kota: When he came to me in the bar, among all his dark thoughts, I glimpsed one bright spot. One beautiful thing he held on to, even in the end.

&gt;Juno: What? 

&gt;Kota: You.

I suppose I may as well spoil TFU2; at the end, the choice the player makes is the same choice the first Starkiller makes. If he spares Vader, he is truly the real Starkiller and the hope both the Force and Luke needed, and so he and Juno both get to live as a result. If he attempts to kill Vader, it proves he is just a defective clone, and the dark side ending is the deserved result."

1,"TNG- ""The Next Phase""  
TNG - ""Time's Arrow""
VOY - ""Distant Origin"" 
Anyone remember other episodes?

All three of these episodes deal with characters that are ""out of phase"" from our reality meaning that they can pass through walls, obects, and people.. and yet they manage to not fall through the floor and into space.  Also they somehow manage to breath air.. would they not be out of phase from oxygen as well and suffocate?

Anyone familiar with Stargate SG1 will get a laugh out of that mistake because it was addressed in an episode and the writers could not come up with an explanation for it."

tl;dr I was once a young Star Wars fan but I lost my interest and forgot majority of the lore and i'm only recently picking up the pieces again.

Anyways, I need help, I'm rewatching the movies on Disney Plus to get properly acquainted with the lore, and the Clone Wars series. I'm making a roleplay group after I'm familiar with the lore completely and I wish to know where and when I should stage my roleplay.

My cousin used to work for TV Guide and was able to get me a copy of each cover since he knew I loved the show.  TV Guide, for anyone younger, used to be for people to find out what show was on what channel before on screen guides, advanced internet and streaming/search.  I wonder if they could have fit all the current cast members with all the new shows had they done this for the 55th Anniversary and assuming TV Guide was still in print.

1,"I admit, the first episode where she insults data rubbed me the wrong way. But this was such a misunderstanding on my part.

Pulaski is such a well rounded character. She is stern and tells it like it is. So of course she’s dismissive of Data, she doesn’t understand him. We see in later seasons that she takes her job very seriously and that she is genuine in her attempting to understand data. 

She brings such depth to this season, being a voice of reason to Picard often that I just don’t see from Dr Crusher

I think Trekbros have really gone too far in hating the actor and don’t understand how great and necessary a character  she is."

0,"Just thought I’d point out while I was watching the clone wars that Anakin inadvertently defeated darth vader by helping yoda escape from the jedi council in a fighter with r2 and allowing him to learn to manifest consciousness after death, thereby giving him the knowledge needed to complete his story of training Anakin’s son on dagobah who would in turn, save the galaxy.

1,"Assignment: Earth was the last episode of season 2 of TOS, and designed as a back-door pilot for a show that didn't get picked up, and as such it exists as kind of a strange non-Trek Trek episode in the canon.

TV has changed a lot since 1968, and I was thinking it may be time to revisit the adventures of Gary Seven, Roberta Lincoln, and their strange cat Isis (although given recent history she may need to be renamed).

Of course, the idea on an alien guy and his attractive companion traveling through time to fix history has been plumbed pretty deep by *Doctor Who*, but there still may be space for such adventures in the Trek universe."
1,"Not ""bloopers,"" really, just little mistakes that made it to air. Wobbly sets, doors not working right, other small mishaps with the set pieces. Easter egg type stuff. Thanks!"
1,"I first got into Star Trek when TNG first aired on TV so I am a pretty old fan. I had watched some TOS but I always thought it was a little to cheesy for me so it never grabbed me like TNG did. I am also a fan of DS9 and Voyager. Never got around to watching Enterprise but will check it out one day. Now, I finally got around to seeing Star Trek: Discovery and aside from the fantastic production value and special effects, it was slog to get through. At no point was I excited to see the next episode. The reasons for the season long arcs were not that interesting. I’ll go through each one. 

Season 1: I’m trying to remember anything interesting about it and I am truly drawing a blank. The battles with the Klingons were cool but I thought overall it was an ok season.

Season 2: Someone from the future travels to the past to stop the AI from destroying everything. So terminator but in space. Another AI wants to kill us story and they throw in time travel as the only solution to win. Not a great season.

Season 3: Probably the one that should have turned everything around but it didn’t. Except for the new technology nothing really interesting happened and the whole reason as to why the fuel they use for space travel was destroyed was just dumb in my opinion. 

All in all, I liked the diverse cast and the different type of aliens were cool. The special effects were movie quality level in my opinion and I really enjoyed looking at the visuals of the show but the writing left a lot to be desired. I’m not sure why they called the show discovery. It should have been called Defiant but it was already taken. So far the only new trek show I have enjoyed has been Lower Decks."
1,"I have a question, this is for something I am creating/writing for fun.

I have a vulcan who has gone through Kolinar.  However she still values the crew around her, how would this play out in her actions and behavior. Those around her would say she totally cares about them, but it doesn't seem apparent.

The only thing I can think of is that she sort of does mental gymnastics, or logically she should see to what ever is bothering someone because it disrupts ship functionality. This might be an easier leap in logic because she is the commander, so part of her job.

But what would maybe make people think its more than her job, duty."

But basically, this post will require your imagination.

1,"Depending on how you look at it, the whole time loop of it is pretty great. 

First contact - 6 years after the battle of Wolf 359 the Enterprise E travels back in time to stop the Borg invading earth and preventing the first warp/first contact with the Vulcans.  

Regeneration- following the aftermath, Remains of a Borg ship is found, ending with them sending a distress signal out, which they estimate will take 400 years to reach the Borg in the Delta Quadrant.  

The Best of Both Worlds - Borg invasion of Wolf 359, Picard is captured and becomes Locutus"
1,"So I recently started a re-watch of DS9 and it was stated that no one had seen a shape shifter before Odo, and I'm remembering the one that helped Kirk and McCoy escape Rura Penthe in Star Trek 6. So did the writers forget that shape shifter? Is it a different species? Has all of Starfleet forgotten there was a race of shapeshifters? I'm confused. Hell Rene Auberjonois was in Star Trek 6 he should have been able to correct the writers mistake."
1,"I really liked the premise of the show, the idea that they were weaker, slower, and more vulnerable than just about everyone else and had to get by on wits and cutting deals. They executed that idea fairly well I think, especially with season 1 and the Xindi season. But you can really see the influence 9/11 left on it, it was interesting to revisit some of those emotions twenty years later. 

Some of the actors felt a bit forced. Cards on the table, I have never been a big Scott Bakula fan. But Trip quickly established himself as the heart and soul of the show, and I learned to love Sato and some of the others.

The writing was just ok. I kept waiting for a deeper, more emotional story line between Trip and T'Pol, or Archer and T'Pol, or anyone really, but it didn't really happen. What an excellent opportunity they had with Trip and T'Pol that never really went as far as it could. I felt Archer and Shran had more of a relationship at times than the two people who were an actual couple for awhile. 

In conclusion, if I wanted a gritty show about a scrappy set of humans fighting to explore, survive, and show us what it means to be human, I'd just watch Battlestar Galactica again."
0,"I haven’t touched on it yet, but I read Labrynth of Evil and ROTS and I thought they were excellent novels, and I love the clone wars tv show, but I often hear that the clone wars tv show retconned a bunch of stuff previously established by other authors, and people who had consumed both media were upset in throwing away all the stories( or most of them at least). For instance, I’ve read that Dooku was more interesting in legends than he was in TCW which portrayed him as cartoonishly evil. 

So my question is there a massive disparity between the two? Is the legends stuff any good?"

Hello fellow Star Wars fans, I am a student at Ursinus College who is doing a project for my Anthropology class on the subculture of the Star Wars fandom. Right now, I am trying to get information from members of the Star Wars fandom on different aspects of the culture including any common beliefs and knowledge that you all share, and any fandom activities you participate in. I have created a Google Form with questions about these topics and I would appreciate it if people could take a few minutes fill it out. This form is completely anonymous however it does ask questions about your demographics, such as age, location, and gender, which will allow me to identify trends about the types of people most involved in this fandom. Thanks for your time, and may the force be with you.

Lastly, does Q show up in anything Star Trek related other than the shows? Thanks!"
1,I as many others were dismayed when Enterprise was cancelled after just starting to really get good and continuations of old stories are nothing new in Star Trek seeing as how The Animated Series is a continuation of TOS an they have a show that is a continuation of Picard's story so is it possible that we could see a continuation of Enterprise? I think a CGI animated show in the same animation style as the last two Starship Troopers movies would fit this well.

0,"Hey there,

I have recently caught the Star Wars fever again (after RoS made me think I won't possible like the franchise again). Now - after watching The Mandalorian, the final Clone Wars season (damn, that was good), catching up with Rebels and playing Jedi: Fallen Order - I am hungry for more good Star Wars content. I have never been a comic guy, and KOTOR is already on my list. Now Books seem to be the next step, however I am not really sure which ones to read. I pretty much hate the sequels and won't enjoy reading books that are directly linked to these movies or this timeframe in general. On the other hand, I don't really want to dive into the seemingly too overwhelming rabbithole that is Legends.

Do you maybe have some tips which books could be a good entry?

I like most genres: romances, detective/crime novels, all scifi subgenres, thrillers... im very openminded. But as I said, everything sequel related is a huge turnoff for me, and I would prefer to stick to canon first. 

Theoretically I am also happy for suggestions for staples/the best of the best of Legends as long as the book doesn't contradict canon (consistency is important to me, lol) and is not much connected to other Legends stuff (like a part of a series).

I heard Thrawn is pretty good, but I think that was more about the Legends version.(?)

Thanks for your help --- may the force be with you"
1,Which movie would you watch
1,In the Picard show they said that machines would eradicate biological beings...if Picard didn’t close that dimensional portal down.  In Star Trek the Motion Picture we learn that Veger must have met a “species” of all machines. Missed opportunity to connect both storylines?
1,"Putting aside all the other complaints you might have about the latest crop of Trek shows, do you think something is  a little off about the starships? Aside from some really good views of Discovery and Enterprise, I feel like I never get a good look at the ships. Every other shot seems either artistically out of focus or you don't get a full shot of the ship. 

I've been browsing the catalog of a company you know that makes tiny starships and one thing I've noticed is how a lot of the ships of the nuEra seem to lack...dimension. The Discovery is a (arguably, I know) handsome ship, but it is kind of flat. So is the Kerala, the Shenzou, the Shran and a bunch of other. It was a design choice, I guess, but the saucers look so thin compared to, say, the Enterprise.  Even the Klingon ships (the Qoj and the Qugh classes) are just kinda flat.  Even the nacelles are just boxy and flat, which is somewhat unprecedented. 

Also, the Zheng He--the USS Copy-and-Paste from Picard--is just really weird. Now that we have more images (and a teeny tiny ship model), it is a strange, Non-Euclidean ship whose dimensions promise  eldritch horrors. From most angles, except directly above, it looks almost asymmetrical.  

I must also confess, that I've promised myself I'd never buy any of those ships, but I will browse the site just so all the ads follow me around to other sites."

My friend has bought himself a model of the USS Melbourne and i thought, as i heard that name, that it was an Excelsior class starship, but was suprised that it is an Nebula class instead.

After looking up Memory Alpha there are both ships as articles and if i get this right both of them were destroyed at Wolf 359. 

So my question is if its common that 2 Ships of the same name participate in the same battle? Wouldnt that cause confusion?"

He points to my action figures and other Star Wars stuff and wants to know the characters’ names. He also has a little picture book about “Darth Vader and son” which I have refused to read to him to avoid ruining the surprise in ESB. But he has picked up on the relationship between Luke and Vader in the pictures. 

I’m considering putting the book and all other Star Wars items up and hoping he’ll forget by the time we are ready to watch the films together. Unfortunately, he has a shockingly great memory. He remembers which grandparent gave him which gift for Christmas, etc. 

Any advice on how to proceed? Should I just give up on the big reveal?

EDIT: Thanks all for reassuring me that nothing’s spoiled. I think you’re all right, at this point it’s pretty much impossible to avoid knowing that Vader is Luke’s dad. It’s just part of the popular culture. More importantly, enjoying age-appropriate Star Wars material together is worth any “spoiler” that may happen anyway."

1,This yes is something that has bugged me ever since TNG.   Yeah the Enterprise D computer is like Cortana or Alexa always  listening.

I'm well into Season 2 and I'm enjoying myself.  They're giving the new doctor plenty of airtime and letting her grow, but I still miss Dr. Crusher.  I just finished the episode where the telekinetic genetic experiments kill those around them inadvertently via their external immune system.  


A really great premise I wish could be explored more, but I guess they will all die on that planet in quarantine.    


Wesley's sidelining is really sad.  To take a prominent piece of Season 1 and the the future of Starfleet and make him sit in a chair and nod yes and no all season is cowardly writing from vindictive writers.  I'd love to have my mind changed on this issue.

0,"I don't like the sequel films myself very much, and was upset that I never got to see my childhood re-invisioned. I recently got into reading some Star Wars books recently, as much as I hate reading. I pushed through and read *Darth Plagueis* and *The Dark Lord Trilogy* and man were they good. I don't like reading usually, but the quality of the content blew me away. I have been reading the original Thrawn trilogy lately and I am honestly in love with it. It is a near-perfect sequel trilogy. You get to see Han, Luke, Leia and Chewbacca go at it in the aftermath of the OT with a A-class villain. Timothy Zahn somehow is able to write the OT characters as if you were watching the OT movies. These books feel like a natural continuation of the OT. I am on the final volume of the trilogy and it truly has been a cinematic experience.

This isn't a sequel hate post nor is it endorsing hate to the sequels. To anyone who hates the sequel trilogy, you can check out the original Thrawn trilogy. There is no need to be upset about what could have been in the Disney sequels. Let the people who enjoyed those movies have fun and you can have fun with these novels. And yes, they are legends, but what exactly does that amount to? Legends is merely another continuity in a *fictional* universe. None of it is real anyways, and i'm sure George Lucas would agree that all that matters is that you are consuming the content that you enjoy."

However, for the time being we would like to avoid episodes which rely heavily on themes of pregnancy and related issues due to personal reasons. The Season 2 episode ""The Child"" caught us off guard, and while I now read the descriptions beforehand, I just wanted to know if you guys and gals could give me a heads up on what episodes to avoid.
I really appreciate the help, thank you"
1,"Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to really like here:  most of the cast is solid (Michelle Yeoh is always a treat!) and the new additions in season 2 are really great (Spock, Pike), the writing is usually pretty good, the visual effects are often terrific to spectacular, the serialized plot works for me, Season 2 is much improved from Season 1 (I'm just finishing Season 2), etc..  Sure, there are some flaws (yes, too much crying, the romantic arcs tend to be slow and plodding, still not sure if I like these very alien Klingons, etc.), but considering I'm only in Season 2, these are minor quibbles and most ST franchises are still finding their footing in their 2nd season.  

So why am I just 'trying to enjoy' it?  It has everything to do with the absolutely terrible way that CBS All Access is editing it.  That is, they are 'missing' the ad breaks.  When a scene is building to a climax, CBS will cut into it about 5-10 seconds too early, jarringly cutting to a several minute long commercial break (weird pharmaceuticals, and endless flogging of Paramount +), and then when DISC comes back on, we get the last 5-10 seconds of the dramatic scene we left a few minutes before, now devoid of its dramatic impact, and then that scene ends and then there is the obvious spot where a commercial break is supposed to happen.  It completely destroys the impact of so many of these scenes---Burnham is struggling and about to be killed, whoops, let's cut to a commercial, when we come back we get the last few seconds of that dramatic fight; or Pike is making a heartfelt speech and the music is swelling and bam!  jagged cut to commercials, when we come back, and we get the last few (now dramatically neutered) moments of the heartfelt speech, etc., etc..  This isn't really an issue with DISC itself as much as it is with how CBS is editing it, which completely destroys the dramatic scenes that are being built up and the pacing of the show.  It's infuriating!"
1,"I am quite new to star trek and this is my first rewatch of TNG and I again can't help to fall in love with Jean-Luc Picard. He is firm and resolute, always gives very thoughtful advice, but his character truly shines when put under critical situations. The way he chooses the words so carefully, his expressions and delivery (so brilliantly played by Patrick Stewart), has me floored again and again. The way most other shows show character deal with impossible is through some bs ex machina copout, no instead Picard has all the information we do, he just comes up with a resolution I would have never thought of even though it's staring me in the face. Symbiosis episode immediately comes to mind. A year ago the only reason I started watching TNG was [because I randomly stumbled on this clip](https://youtu.be/6zU8bw4raiE), the way he carefully chooses simple words yet brilliantly explains her the situation it's like it was written by Carl Sagan! I am right now on the episode s4e12 ""The Wounded"" and his dialogue with the Cardassian representative is yet another masterpiece. I almost want to write it down how he deals with problems, he is truly an inspirational character.

I don't want to rant about other characters, but I am bit puzzled why Picard and Guinan (and Data step below them) are so much better written than everyone else."
1,"Is there a list of transporter uses and who the operating character is. I was watching a YouTube video completely unrelated to star trek and they used the phrase ""Beam me up Scotty"" . If I recall correctly Scotty did operate the transporter on a regular basis in original series. Presuming it was a new technology at this point in time requiring the time of the lead engineer. But in tng that responsibility rarely was left to Geordie and was O'Brien's responsibility. Leading one to believe this was a mature technology. Either so simple it didn't require the lead engineer or was so specialised it regularly required a specialist. It may have just been that the main ship transporter was used so regularly it was a post that always needed to be manned at all times."
1,"They should adapt a lot from the Countdown to Trek 09 comic, which they initially advertised as being canon. That book, taken into consideration, actually makes the Hobus Supernova seem like less of  a ham-fisted narrative device, and more like a galaxy-spanning event worth fleshing out in  a well-paced, serialized TV series. It could show a lot of things which the Picard series only provided glimpses of in exposition, and adaptor modify some of the storylines from STO as well."

1,"I considered posting this to TOMT or something, but was thinking that someone here might be more likely to remember.

A parody mash-up of video and audio from TNG. I remember it started with Picard's voiceover of the Captain's log mentioning a stardate that was exceedingly long (might've been taken from when Data impersonated his voice, when he changed the password for the Enterprise in the episode Brothers). It also had Data winning a poker hand with five aces. I believe they took the scene of Dr. Crusher in the ready room from ""Naked Now"", with CGI breasts superimposed while Picard did that strange nervous laugh that was obviously added in post.

Does anyone remember this? It was in the '90s, so it was a BBS fileshare thing, obviously not a video posted online.

Any help would be most appreciated."

How about a meta approach? How about TNG is the tales of Picard, produced for the audience of his time? You could have Jean Luc further explore his mortality and humanity by him passing a screen on some faraway planet and seeing his own adventures. You could even flash into those events in the Picard universe and show Tasha Yar being killed."

Overall, I'm really liking this show so far. It's dated and often quite campy, but it's got such charm to it, the stories are interesting, and most importantly the actors have such charisma and chemistry with eachother. And even though it's set in the future, I love the 60s vibe it gives off. It's both a vision of an optimistic future and a glamorization of the style of its time. The show is... *sexy*, if you know what I mean. And I love the vibrant colors, it looks like an old Technicolor movie. Anyway, great show so far."

0,"I was taking a shower thinking of life's great mysteries I often think about what ifs, especially with Star Wars. By the way, I am not hating on the sequels I did enjoy 7 and 8, and I like what some parts of 9 did. I personally believe there is always something out there for somebody regarding with Star Wars. Thus, I was thinking back on the theories before the Rise of Skywalker came out. And I felt like this would be interesting to talk about and want to hear your opinions on my idea.

Honestly I thought Rey was going to completely go to the Dark Side. I had this idea that she became so disillusioned on her image of Luke Skywalker and has conflicted feelings. At this time Leia takes over as the mentor role for Rey. Rey throughout the film has become to impatient for answers and adventure. She has shown to quickly get angry and start going on the offensive. She is gradually getting angry at herself possibly wasting her time when she learned her parents were nobody, at her conflicted feelings of the Jedi and Luke Skywalker, at her failed attempt to turn Ben Solo to light. 

Meanwhile, Kylo Ren is at Vader's castle on Mustafar. Constantly thinking about Rey. They haven't formed a Force Connection since they last seen each other. Constantly feeling guilty over the death of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Throughout the film he tries to search for her throughout the galaxy. 

So I really thought Palpatine was just going to have a crazy flash back scenes. That take place before the Phantom Menace. I didn't think they were going to do the clone thing from Legends. I personally thought it was better done then. And if they were going to do it, I thought Matt Smith, Doctor Who, was going to play a clone of Palpatine showing he is back and younger and more powerful. And I feel like realizing this whole time Ben solo was manipulated by Palpatine. Thus pushing Kylo towards the light more. 

I would think to explain Carrie's death they would have this young Palpatine kill her, out of revenge for his death. This would also push Rey to the dark side and Poe Dameron to take over as leader of the Resistance.


I honestly felt Finn's story kind of concluded in The Last Jedi. I was disappointed because I felt they kind of written his ending a bit. Like, he finally beat Phasma and became a rebel hero. I do have ideas of what could they done with him but, I felt like that is better for a different post. What I was thinking was Finn was going to be Rey's connection to the rest of the Resistance, kind of like an Anchor for Rey. 

I recall thinking the final battle was going to take place in Coruscant. I thought it was going to connect to the Prequels more. I feel like Rey would have striked and killed Palpatine out of some intense justice for the galaxy and kill him like brutally too. This would have drawn Rey to make that cool double bladed red lightsaber and be dark. She would think she is a better than a Jedi but doesn't call herself Sith. She and a redeemed Ben Solo would finally fight as the Resistance led by Poe, Lando, Chewie and everybody.

Also no death star weapons. Idk these are just thoughts."
0,"Virtually everything that contributed to Sidious’ death at the hands of his apprentice was the result of Sidious’ own doing.

1) His destroyer, Anakin Skywalker, was the product of his and Darth Plagueis’ attempt to create life with the Force.

2) Anakin didn’t need any weapon to kill the Emperor; the Death Star’s internal architecture sufficed. Guess who decided to build the superweapon in the first place?

3) Sidious didn’t see Vader’s turn coming because he was preoccupied with Luke Skywalker. Luke was the fruit of the forbidden romance Sidious had encouraged between Anakin and Padmé in hopes of turning Anakin to the Dark Side. 

4) The Emperor was aboard the Death Star because he was using himself as bait to lure the Rebel fleet to Endor.

5) Sidious’ last act was to shamelessly renege on the promise he’d made to lure Anakin to the Dark Side: the ability to save his loved ones from dying. So confident was he that Vader was Dark forever, that he never imagined that Anakin would come back to claim what was owed him.

In the end, the last Sith Lord had no one to blame for his downfall but himself. He managed to cheat a Jedi Prophecy for some time, but his expectations were ultimately subverted."
1," We’ve all watched the transporters in ""Star Trek"" and seen them as a distant sci-fi pipe-dream. But the more we find out about quantum mechanics, the more attainable this idea becomes.

 [CGP Grey released a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nQHBAdShgYI) explaining the practical considerations and philosophical head-scratching involved in a ""Star Trek""-esque transporter. In short, it would involve the atoms that make us up to be broken down and then reassembled in a different state. Of course, the atoms would be identical to you; the way you look, the structure of your brain, even technically your thought patterns and memories. But then comes the metaphysical headache of whether that *is* you or just a copy of you. If it does just copy you, then the transporter is pretty much a fancy suicide booth.  

 Well, the plot thickens.  [MinutePhysics has released a rebuttal](https://youtu.be/dAaHHGHuy1c) that thinks it might have the answer. In their video they explain that scientists began looking at a thing called quantum teleportation in the nineties. This is the process whereby quantum information – such as the state of an atom–- could be transmitted. However, a major clause in this theory is the “no cloning theorem.” Essentially, to create a replica of a quantum state, the original must be destroyed in order to obtain all the information.

Science is still pretty shady on what exactly constitutes consciousness and what makes you “you,” so it's still hard to say. However, if it was something to do with the quantum state of certain electrons and atoms in our brain, then it doesn’t look too hopeful that “you” would survive the journey.

1,"Detmer, Owo, and co. are not the main characters. This is like complaining about not knowing any of the random characters B'ellana is shouting orders at or complaining that we don't know anything Ogawa in TNG.

The main characters of Discovery are Burnham (Duh), Saru, Stamets, Tilly, and a rotating cast of characters that include Culber (As of season 3), the rotating captains, the rotating admirals, and Adira (As of season 3 again).

Of these characters, three are bridge crew, and one (Saru as of the start of season 3 and Burnham as of the end of season 3) are in charge of their departments.

TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, and ENT are all about the bridge crew and the officers in charge of the various departments. DSC has focused on the characters who wouldn't be receiving near as much focus if they were on one of those shows. Stamets's appearnaces would only be to be shouted at by the chief of engineering, Culber's appearances would only be to administer a hypospray and maybe talk about his relationship to another crew member, and Tilly would have three episodes throughout the show focused on her and would never be talked about or talked to outside of those episodes.

There are reasons to complain about DSC, but I don't think the lack of focus on the bridge crew should be one of them."
0,"Ever heard that Start Wars is not Science Fiction, but Space Opera?  
So have I, but I didn't read the definition. I thought that it meant a grand story like an opera but set in space. 

Well, that's not the meaning at all. It's an expression first used by Wilson Tucker in 1941 for Soap Opera style Science Fiction of the worst kind! He described it as: A ""hacky, grinding, stinking, outworn, spaceship yarn"". Well, that's not how I would describe Star Wars.

It has later been redefined a few times at least. With Hartwell and Cramer defining it as: 

""...colorful, dramatic, large-scale science fiction adventure, competently and sometimes beautifully written, usually focused on a sympathetic, heroic central character and plot action, and usually set in the relatively distant future, and in space or on other worlds, characteristically optimistic in tone. It often deals with war, piracy, military virtues, and very large-scale action, large stakes.""

This sound a bit better as describing Star Wars, but it misses a few points. I would not describe it as overly optimistic. It's more about making it against all odds, but maybe that is the optimism? Also, it may well be a description of Star Wars used to define Space Opera. Any insights would be great! 

So, what are the things that make up Star Wars from a literary standpoint?  

What are the elements of the story?

What parts of the story departs from those basic elements, stands out, does not fit with the rest?

Is Space Opera really the best definition? If so, what definition is that...?"

1,"I've been thinking about this in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and the measures our society has taken to avert the risk from it. Some of the arguments made in Star Trek episodes persuade me that we may have become too risk averse. Like when Picard first encounters the borg, Q tells him ""if you can't take a little bloody nose maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondorous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross, but it's not for the timid."" And that absolutely applies to life in general as well. Maybe we should crawl back under our bed if we don't want the risk, but we'd be losing out.

Or TNG: A Matter of Time - at the end of that episode Picard is left with a choice: ""To try or not to try. To take a risk or to play it safe... I choose to try"". That's part of being human and I'd hate to see people lose that by becoming so risk averse. Like Archer said throughout ENT, they didn't send probes out into deep space to meet new species. They sent humans, or what's the point?

Then we have TNG:Tapestry when Picard is given the choice of a pathetic lonely existence or his own his death. And as we all know, he choose to die rather than to live the life he saw. It's the same choice we're given with the pandemic and it's sad to see so many people being so risk averse.

In DS9, when the changelings inflitrated Earth, Sisko's father refuses to take a blood test and I think he was right. ""You can't go around making people prove they are who they say they are. That's no way to live and I'm not gonna go along with it."" Equally I don't think you can go around asking people to prove their vaccination status or expect them to take a test.

In TOS: Return to Tomorrow, Kirk puts it best: ""Risk is our Business. That's what this starship is all. That's why we're aboard her.""

If you hate what I've said please tell me why, this is just to start discussion on the topic.

0,"As the Star Wars universe has expanded a lot of things in the OT either don't make a lot of sense anymore or are simply absent. Hell, the same can also be said to a lesser degree about the PT. Also, due to age and technology, the OT looks pretty out of place compared with everything else.

At this time we have new actors established and generally accepted in the roles of Han, Lando, Chewbacca and with (fingers crossed) Stan Shaw on deck for Luke. The only major role that would need casting is Leia. On top of that, the actors who portrayed Obi-Wan, Anakin and even Owen &amp; Beru are now at the perfect ages to play those characters in the OT era.

So much could be fixed, brought up to date and made to better fit the complete story. Characters that weren't yet thought of in 1977 could be acknowledged if not actually used (Qui-Gon, Ahsoka, Grogu, etc.). Palpatine could be more visible right from the start. Oh, and tell me you wouldn't LOVE to see Ewan &amp; Hayden go at it again on the first Death Star in another furious lightsaber duel.

Because of where we are right now, this is the perfect time to bring the OT up to the present. Doing so wouldn't change or negate the original OT as that will always exist. It would make for a more cohesive and full story.

1,"I know I'm potentially committing a great sin, but I've never ventured outside TOS aside from watching the pilot of TNG, and I was so disappointed I never touched it again. However, this was years ago, and I've grown as a person as has my attention span. Watching TOS as a kid, I always watched it out of order, picking episodes I thought would be the most entertaining. Since there's no solid season-wide plot, it works quite well. If I attempted that with TNG, would it work? Or does it have season-wide plot lines? And if I were to bounce around for a bit, watching random episodes to get a feel for the series, does anyone have any first-episode recommendations?"

Jordi goes missing trying to save his sons from an explosion but is communicating digitally from another dimension.

1,"I’m sticking this out to develop my own understanding, conscious it’s a bit of a red rag and expecting downvotes.

I have greatly enjoyed Discovery and to a lesser extent Picard.  I have defended both in this sub, and trying to be rational the main argument I react to is that DSC should be more like TNG/VOY when it’s bracketing series are ENT and TOS - with which IMO it fits much better.

But I’m increasingly conscious that I’m not going to change anyone’s view if they don’t like the show - which is of course fair enough.  That said I feel like I gained appreciation of Voyager from listening to its fans, who got me to look at its dynamics in a different way; things I thought were weaknesses, such as the ship’s lack of attrition, were not necessarily so.

Getting frustration out by venting to others is of course valid.

So my question to the vocal critics is - are you venting frustration, seeking to persuade others not to like the shows by pointing out their faults, or something else?

I expect everyone will have a different answer- but I’m curious."
1,"Just finished Voyager a few days ago and watch the desperately sad episode where 7 of 9 makes a holodeck program of voyagers crew so she can practice her socialising (it's sad because she feels she can be more human with holo characters then the real people)

Anyway, she ends up having some sort of fling with holo-Chakotay, she has to end it as its breaking some borg processor.

From what iv gathered, the holo-characters that are based on real people are generated by using transporter records, so one could assume these characters are anatomically correct...

Without beating around the bush too much... How inappropriate it is to make holo-characters of people you know for sexy time.. I mean, 7 did it, Barkley did it. I'm sure plenty of characters in Quarks holosuites are based on real people. Is it rapey or is it exceptible in the future? Thoughts?"

So, I needed to ask, can anyone here explain in a good way (without saying that teenagers dress like that) that the writers would dress her like that.

I understand that they change it like half way though, but it really made me think about why they dressed her like that.

That said... I am new to Deep Space Nine! Just a few moments ago I finished the pilot, ""Emissary"". I found the plot a bit confusing, but I thought it was a solid introduction to the cast, I found the idea of an alien who didn't understand the concept of linear time to be intriguing, and I was engaged through-out. I'm looking forward to continuing the series and already I like the protagonist Sisko. 

However - and this is the point of my post - I'm a bit confused as to some of the elements of the show's premise :) 

I know who the Cardassians and the Bajorans are, and I get the general gist of their relations - Cardassians are brutal invaders of Bajor, and Bajorians are enslaved by them. But I'll be honest, I think the last time I sat down and watched TNG was over a year ago now, so I dont remember it all terribly clearly and I think I could do with a refresher and watch the most important past episodes to bring me up to speed with the Cardassians/Bajorans story-line. I remember Ro Laren and her episode from TNG, so I think I may re-watch it as it seems like it'd be important to catch up on. 

Are there any other important TNG episodes you would recommend I go back and re-watch, before continuing on with DS9? To make sure that I'm lost and can keep up with the story, and who all the different species are and what their motivations are? 

Thanks :)"
0,"1) re-release republic commando on multiple devices, including the switch to get a new group of fans fixated on the story. Building in the fan base it currently has. 

2) see how many units they sell of this game to gauge interest, especially with the release of Bad Batch soon. It makes sense. 

3) once enough people have played through the game, they’ll let us know a sequel is in the works i image along the line.  

4) Bad Batch gets us invested in the story a little more post order 66, also the original clones had no inhibitor chips … just saying. So this makes for some very interesting plot points that may pan out in the Bad Batch … 

5) Republic Commando Sequel then releases ….. I think it’s going to happen! Thoughts??"

1,"I've recently been rewatching all the classic series and am on Voyager now (up to S4 if anyone's curious).

And in voyager, there always seems to he a huge plot point and contention to having to go through or around some anomaly or spacial region. But why never go above or bellow these regions of space?

I'm watching through episode 25, season 4 now: *One* and it slightly annoys me that in this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/j955mqh.jpg) they could easily circumvent the nebula by going above it or bellow it. 

In the episode, they state thay going around it would add an additional year to their journey but it looks so much easier to use the full 3 dimensionality of space.
I get that maybe it's a plot point, or maybe the writers themselves had trouble thinking in 3D but there's sooo many episodes that run into this exact conundrum.

I was extremely happy when star trek discovery finally seemed to eliminate this issue and use the full spacial region around themselves."

[https://unwhitewashthebadbatch.carrd.co/](https://unwhitewashthebadbatch.carrd.co/)

An excerpt from the about page:

“Whitewashing is when a creator takes a character of color and changes their features, skin, hair, or other details about them to make them appear more white/less like their racial/ethnic identity. “

“Every clone trooper is a clone of Jango Fett, who is played by a Māori man named Temuera Morrison. The Bad Batch is a group of genetically altered clone troopers who have ""desirable mutations"" that make them physically different from ""regs"" (a derogatory word for regular, unaltered clones). These clones are smarter, fight harder, are more independent, and are white. This happened to every single member of The Bad Batch. Whitewashing is racist. Genetic superiority tied to skin color or ability is racist (and ableist). The Bad Batch is racist.”

I'd like to think that, similarly to the events surrounding Paramount's Sonic film, the Star Wars community could try and make this more well known. And I'd like to think the fandom located here would be willing to help make that possible.

I've been going through Voyager again, and in S3 E4, The Doctor starts losing his memory and intellect because of all the additions he's been making to his program. In the end, they cannibalize the diagnostic program for the EMH, which, according to the diagnostic program, has the same matrix as The Doctor. It suddenly hit me that, if the doctor is a life form, a person with rights of his own, isn't the EMH diagnostic program an intelligent life as well?

The diagnostic program consents to giving up his existence so that The Doctor can live. Currently, I have a couple pretty messy questions. First, is that program aware enough to be able to consent to the procedure? Remember how the doctor viewed himself at the very beginning. Like any other hologram. And second, even if we assume that he was fully aware of the gravity of what he gave up, why didn't the show have at least a moment of pause, like it had with Tuvix?

And a side note. I love that I can watch this show and, 20 years later, still find new things I'd completely missed."

The plan is to make him feel like i care about his interests and i want to spoil him by making a topic he is the best at. My whole knowledge about Star Wars is that there are the good guys called Jedi that follow a religion called the force (?), and the evil guys like Darth Vader that follow the religion called the Dark side (?), the good guys are Luke and Yoda and some other guys, Leia is his sister and was his crush, Anakin is Darth Vader, etc. I have a very basic understanding of it.

I want to be able to at least discuss some politics, but i have no idea where to start or how to even bring it up. I want help understanding it, for complete noobs. Maybe some other topics i can bring up, other than politics. Maybe religion, relationships, discuss a popular city/species/character that i dont fully understand. I would appreciate any help with topics or questions i can ask him. I want him to feel like we are having a flowing conversation about his favourite show without stopping up.

The only things i liked that are kinda similar to SW is the specie designs, especially in the Mandalorian, and ive watched the Voltron reboot. Kinda similar maybe? Maybe some topics that connect them together?

1,Anyone know of any other pieces of music which have that kind of use of the horn?
1,"Yes, I'm aware that Worf and Data extract him from the Borg ship in TNG season 4 episode. But I  don't mean his physical escape from their company and environment. I mean, how did he break the Borgs' hold over his *spirit*? It is clarified (in the same episode) that it isn't simply a matter of removing the implants (which Beverly says would be very difficult), nor is it a matter of blocking or jamming the Borgs' signal-link with Locutus-Picard (LP), because that might be fatal to Picard. Later, after Data has tried to interface with the Borg through LP, the latter suddenly shows ""increased neural activity"". Data says it's unclear what's causing that, but Ms. Troi steps in and says, ""No, it's not! It's him, it's Picard."" LP then takes hold of Data's arm, apparently in an attempt to establish a physical link to the human world. (And it sure is ironic that he does that with Data, who is a machine.) Ms. Troi then reports to the bridge that ""Data has made first contact with Captain Picard."" Data observes that the break of the Borg's hold over Picard was not his doing, and that it was ""Captain Picard himself who has somehow managed himself to initiate contact.""

Okay, but how? Is this elaborated on in any later episodes? I have not seen all TNG episodes, so I'm not sure. What I wonder about in particular, is why others can't (or don't) escape. The Borg aren't really a race, but a collective of ""assimilated"" races. Presumably all of those races were intelligent creatures like humans, Klingons, Romulans, Vulcans, etc. If Picard could be saved, can't many of them be saved? If no, why not? What made Picard unique? If yes, shouldn't the Federation make an effort to un-Borg the Borg? And if they did, what would be the method?Does un-Borging a creature require that he/she be extracted from the Borgs' physical environment?

Just some things I was wondering about. Comments will be appreciated."
0,"As fans, we all have our own opinions on what star wars is missing or what it could do better, whether that be story, characters, or some other things alltogether. So, with that said, here’s one of my main gripes about star wars:

I get like budget stuff I guess, but Star Wars is a huge property that’s owned by disney, so its not like they dont have the money to spend on it. So I restate my question, where are all the aliens?"
1,Nothing else to add rlly haha
1,"I'm sure there are a multitude of posts like this, but I suppose I'll add my thoughts to the fray after finishing my Discovery binge. 

First off, I've been a trek fan for a long time. In order I like (excluding Disco and Picard), DS9, TNG, TOS, VOY and Enterprise. I even \*liked\* Enterprise.  I just rewatched all of them (thank you Netflix) and my DS9 love is cemented even further as is my appreciation of TNG and TOS.  To me, the characters are the most important thing, even more so the world building. All the best Trek has ultimately bloomed from the characters and their relationships. 

So I was willing to give Discovery a chance. S1 was interesting - I enjoyed the pace, a different take on the Klingons (although did they even bother retconning?) and getting to know characters like Saru. The over focus on Burnham has been well documented and I agree, although I think she had the acting chops to mostly shoulder the burden.   The spore drive was conceived by a writer that was high, no doubt - but I went with it.  Loved the inclusive and diverse nature of the crew, both in gender and in sexuality/identity.  It seemed natural and unforced, not gimmicky. 

S2 was a bit different, with a unifying story that mostly worked. (I like having a core story that's being told serially.) Pike saved the show, for me. He was a complete breath of fresh air.  I also really enjoyed seeing Saru mature as a leader and captain (in S2 and S3) He has his own distinct, laid back style which \*works\*. They added (and then deleted) an interesting character in Ariam. Again, there was a lot of style over substance, but enough substance to keep me engaged. I have a number of quibbles, but not enough for it to ruin it for me.   

S3, set 900 years in the future - THAT was an exciting prospect. Forget trying to integrate story lines within the existing canon and being boxed in by whats come before. Leap over the temporal wars, and come in with a clean slate. What an opportunity! 900 years is a long time - going back 900 years would send you to the 1100s. The difference in technology and society should have been huge, and the opportunities for storytelling infinite. 

But man, I was disappointed. Both by the story and the storytelling. Again, the Burnham show, but without strong characters like the other 2 seasons to counterbalance her.  But to me, it was a mess. A rush to solve a 150+ year mystery? The revelation of what the Burn at the end was laughable. (We spent all season to find THAT out?)  There were some nice flashes of technology, but nothing that seemed like ""magic"", as 22nd century technology would have seemed to someone from the dark ages.  Floaty nacelles and holographic combadges non-withstanding. 

And the characters. Ossyra - the big bad - turns out just to be really a thug. I was hoping that this was an opportunity to maybe explore how societies change - ala' Asmiov's Foundation series - and maybe the Federation morphs into something less righteous and more ... pragmatic? Something to show not just the technological shifts, but how \*societies\* change over almost a millenia? Again, touches of that - Vulcan's transformation, for example. (And that part was fascinating!) But Earth's San Francisco Bay looks like someone in the 1950's would have imagined 2020. 

And by Season 3 we should know more about the crew. Tig Notaro is just there for comic relief (although I do love her). I couldnt tell you - besides Detmer and Stamets and Tilly- the names of the other crew. Detmer had generic PTSD, gets over it - okay.  And the fault isnt with the actors, I think they didnt have a ton to work with.  There was room for more, if they took out completely tangential (and half-assed) story lines like Adira and the Trill.  Tilly - an \*ensign\* over everyone else for number 1?  What?   

I can deal with a bad show. But it's really disappointing that an opportunity was lost to set a bold direction.  Resurrecting the Federation isn't it.  It's like the writers sit in a room and think, ""Hey this is cool!"" without thinking it through. That's how ""Lost"" became so ""Lost"" and I'm afraid that's where Discovery is heading. (Maybe they'll wake up and it'll all be purgatory?)

But you know, despites my misgivings, I'll watch it. Because its Trek."

I feel it is more likely that they would have destroyed themselves after the dawn of their “nuclear age”, rather then survive and discover warp drive."

0,"In order to really drive home how this works out in the long run I have to take this back to the beginning so bear with me. I’m going to use what Freddie Prinze jr said on a podcast a while back then build off of it so it ties into my final point. 

When Palpatine perverted the force to an unfathomable degree the force finally decided that the Sith were no longer a manageable nuisance and needed to be dealt with. 

The force creates a “chosen one,” to be borne by Shmi Skywalker. Years later the hope of the universe is discovered by the Jedi then trained. 

Palpatine, being the cunning strategist he is knows he cannot kill Anakin otherwise the force will retaliate with something even greater. Something he truly cannot conquer. So what does Sheev do? He seduces Anakin. Throwing a wrench in the Force’s grand plan. Or so he thinks. Unbeknownst to him Anakin is still the chosen one, regardless of the plot twist.

So the force, upon seeing that there’s now TWO Sith, creates twins Luke &amp; Leia.

But Luke/Leia are babies they cannot help Anakin, nor can they effect him in the way he needs to be effected so what does the force for the time being until they grow up? It clears the path.

Jedi like Ashoka, Cal Kestis, Kanan, Ezra etc have a critical role. Their job is to eliminate roadblocks. Inquisitors, assassins, what have you. So by the time Luke is old enough it’s just him and Vader. Nobody to get in between a critical confrontation. Because Luke offers Vader the one thing he needs, the thing he turned to the dark side over. The only thing that can bring Anakin back to fulfill his destiny: FAMILY. 

Should Luke fail, then Leia is the backup plan.


Fast Forward years later.

Somehow Palpatine does it again, he flies in the face of god. He cheated when he shouldn’t have been able to.

But the force is smart. The force KNOWS Palpatine and his personality. Palpatine’s ego won’t allow him to accept defeat so out of spite he corrupts the descendant of the person who defeated him. Take that Force! Win for the Sith...or so he thinks. 

The force has a plan. This time it’s salty so it’s going to do a little spiting of it’s own. It’s going to create a dyad between Ben and not just any random girl, oh no the force wants to add insult to injury. So it makes the second half of the dyad Rey. The forgotten heir of Palpatine.

But there’s still a problem. 2 Dark siders/1 Jedi.

In order for this plan to work there needs to be two Jedi. So it sets a chain of events into motion, with the end goal of bringing Ben Solo back to the light. In order to do this a few people need to clear the roadblocks once again. 

Han needs to help. To show his son that hope is not lost. Luke needs to apologize, to remind him that hope isn’t lost in him, and Leia needs to do the same. 

That way the big player, Rey can be the final seed. Because Rey offers Ben the thing he needs most. Hope and for someone to like him for who he is. Not just view him as a legacy as Han/Leia &amp; Luke did. 

It works. The dyad unifies, and defeats Palpatine.

BUT the force being all knowing had a third option. A backup plan had Ben chose to remain loyal to the dark side. Then kill Palpatine, or choose to work with Palpatine. 

Know who/what the alternate was? The bench warmer?

Finn."

I have been heavily requesting these titles throughout last year and I am so happy to finally see them home on Disney+ in the Star Wars tab where they belong. Now all we’re missing is Star Wars: Droids the series (And also the Star Wars Holiday Special but that is a longshot).

I know the Geneva Conventions probably don’t apply in interactions between the Ferengi and Dominion, but I’m pretty sure they still violated them. Cousin Gela committed the first one by executing a POW without due process, accidentally or not. Nog committed the second one by desecrating the corpse with his neural gadget. Quark is guilty as the mission commander who failed to prevent the first and encouraged the second. However, this assumes that 1) Ferenginar is a signatory to the space-Geneva convention, and 2) that the Dominion has any such definitions or makes any distinction about how the Federation treated a Vorta that is both a traitor and supposed to have committed suicide before allowing his capture. If neither of those is true, then the only guilty one is Nog, because he's a Starfleet officer and wearing his Starfleet uniform on the mission."

0,"It's interesting to note the attitudes various Sith Lords had towards their non-Sith identities.

Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus took full advantage of their dual identities; till their dying days they went by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine and Count Dooku respectively. Doing this helped them to deceive the public - the Senate voted for *Palpatine* (not Sidious), while many Separatists believed they were following a principled former Jedi (not a Sith Lord).

On the other hand, 'Maul' was apparently Darth Maul's only name from childhood, so unlike his contemporaries he didn't need to change identities at all.

In contrast, Darth Vader *actively* tried to bury Anakin Skywalker after he got put into the suit. Initially, Vader thought of himself not as a separate person from Anakin, but rather as Anakin's fully-realised self. From his conversation with Padmé on Mustafar, we see that pre-suit Vader fully intended to hold on to much of his Anakin Skywalker life - overthrowing Sidious, keeping Padmé alive and ruling the galaxy with her by his side.

Only after he was disfigured and mutilated on Mustafar and learned that he had killed Padmé himself did Darth Vader try to stop being Anakin. All of a sudden, the 'Hero with No Fear' was no longer a persona he could wear in public. Out of shame and self-loathing, Vader tried to make a complete break with the man he had once been. Fortunately for Luke and the galaxy, he never truly succeeded.

In retrospect, Anakin's ""death"" on Mustafar may actually have saved the good in him. If Darth Vader had been able to continue being Anakin Skywalker in public just as his Master continued being Emperor Palpatine in public, the persona of Anakin may have become fully corrupted by his evil deeds. By the time of the Empire, no one made a distinction between Darth Sidious and Emperor Palpatine because there *was* no distinction!

But by falling on Mustafar, Darth Vader was essentially forced to put his Anakin Skywalker self in cold storage, where it lay dormant until Luke reactivated it 23 years later. As a result, Ben Kenobi was able to describe Anakin as a good man, while Luke had a cherished image of his father he could look up to. In this way, the goodness in Anakin was successfully preserved until it reemerged aboard the second Death Star."

TLDR; I was a big hater of rebels but stomach season 1 I promise it gets much, much better. Some of the single coolest scenes in all of star wars!"
1,"This has probably been said before but I just had the realization that most trek takes place after the other or during. IE: TOS---&gt;TNG/DS9-&gt;Voyager and ENT being relatively accurate to the history spoken about in earlier series. 

Discovery makes no sense, there's never any mention of a spore drive, the borg are fought but the federation isn't prepared for them at all in tng, their ship, technology, Kelpiens among other species that have never even been mentioned in previous canon. 

Last but not least, the characters. Pike sure, he's a notable captain, Saru, Ash Tyler(also hell what is WRONG with the rest of the klingons? If this takes place after ENT and before TOS why the hell do the klingons look like... that...)

The most egregious issue with Discovery besides the writing is that someone as skilled, outspoken and intelligent as Michael Burnham never being brought up throughout any of the previous series just screams not canon. ESPECIALLY considering the fact she's Spocks adopted sister? With the way they've been writing her throughout the series how could history forget about her? It just doesn't add up, why couldn't they just make this series in the Kelvin timeline?

1,"The Prophets/Wraiths and the Q Continuum exist outside space-time and are non-corporeal beings; the Organians are also non-corporeal but inhabit the regular space-time; it’s uncertain where Nagilum’s kind lives and what is their nature; the Douwd is definitely corporeal, as well as the Metrons. I always considered Trelane’s species much like the Organians, but it’s not sure they are from the regular space-time (although there is a non-canon work stating that Trelane is in fact a Q).

All these entities are vastly more advanced beyond any other race shown to exist in the 23th/24th/31th century. They are essentially god-like in the sense they cannot be harmed, resisted or perhaps even understood fully by even the most advanced powers in the galaxy.

Is asking which one of them is more advanced or powerful really a valid question? One can argue the Douwd or the Metron isn’t in the same league with the others because they are or seem to be corporeal, but their feats contradict it directly (remember a single lonely Douwd extinguished a spacefaring species instantly with a *thought*).

Star Wars: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... 
YouTube: Star Wars Orgin Story https://youtu.be/SVSox0qApO4
Watch it, ask yourself how did it get here.
Theory: Mace Windu during his escape from Palatine’s Jedi purge somehow crossed over to the MCU multiverse. 

Modern Day: Marvel Universe

Nick Fury has an uncanny ability to anticipate future events. 
No matter what happens to Nick Fury he’s seems to survive despite the odds. 
Nick Fury gets along with other alien races and seems to have an understanding of these race well before any one else.
Nick Fury has an eye for technology that no one else knows exist.

Mace Windu is Nick Fury in exile, much like Yoda and later Luke Skywalker. 
Realizing through the years that he had traveled to alternate Universe, Windu took the identity as Nick Furry. Sensing a dark present through the force, much like the Emperor's, Nick Fury began recruiting force sensitive individuals and guiding them to find their true potential, known as the Avengers, to protect earth and the galaxy. Rather than teach the Jedi Religion and repeat the mistakes of the past, Furry took a more hands off approach to allow the individual to naturally discover their force abilities themselves and nudged them as needed Example: Thor, force lightning. Hawkeye, force user that uses his ability to shoot. Tony Stark, force ability to communicate with technology. 
We can make a lot of parallels here with force abilities and superpowers.

By now your asking yourself how does this all come together. According to Star Wars Lore in the Old Republic the Sith Emperor who had great thirst for power and control seeking to control the galaxy under Sith rule is know as Emperor Tenebrae. By the age 10 Tenebrae had lead a path of destruction and death wiping the entire population off of his home world in a dark ritual known as force transfer. The ritual allowed him to consume all the force from all living things on the planet and short out the droids. His rule over the sith lasted 1500 years. 
In this multiverse the Emperor is Thanos. His objective is to bring balance to the universe, by wiping out half the population. V"

0,"Not sure if this has already been discussed to death, but this was my revelation following my latest viewing of ROTJ (despecialized, of course).   

And it’s pretty obvious in retrospect, but a lot of the attack infrastructure (like the felled logs which took out multiple AT-ST’s) is simply too complicated to be assembled quickly and too specifically useful against the walkers to be used for anything else, really. Those guys were planning an attack and had the resources on hand to carry it out.   
And it makes sense, the imperials were almost certainly assholes who killed individual Ewoks for sport and despoiled the natural beauty of their home. Some sort of insurgency was inevitable.  
Then, imagine a Golden God appears and appears to bless your attack and brings allies to your fight, and it became inevitable at that point.

1,"Just a thought I've always had about a potentially different direction DS9 could have gone, but didn't:

DS9 sets up a conflict between Jem'Hadar bred in the Alpha quadrant and those bred in the Gamma quadrant in the episode One Little Ship, then never mentions it again.

I'd have loved it if the Alphas decided to stop worshipping the Founders and joined the cult of the Pah Wraiths, going rogue and setting up their own faction based on freedom for the Jem'Hadar, ruled by Gul Dukat. They think they're better than the Gammas and that their Founder gods have failed them, and it's only through allying with the Pah Wraiths that they can take their place as a dominant species in the Galaxy. Maybe the Pah Wraiths can even use their timey wimey magic to cure them of addiction to the white, cementing their place as gods and giving Jem'Hadar a reason to join them.

This could have been seeded by showing strange Dominion activity like mysterious battles and destroyed outposts, and the appearance of Pah Wraith cult sites among the Jem'Hadar as the Vorta lost control of them, which would have been an intriguing little mystery to solve, with the big payoff coming at the Battle of Deep Space Nine.

Rather than having the Prophets deus ex machina the whole thing by destroying the Dominion fleet in the wormhole, they could have had a large part of the Alpha fleet go rogue in the battle and attack the Gammas as they come through, doing enough damage to neutralise their threat before warping off to Empok Nor.

It would have given Dukat something to do and the little tribe of followers he always wanted, as well as a sensible motivation beyond moustache twirling evil. It would have given the Pah Wraith threat a form rather than shady cultists and glowy balls of light, and it would have paid off all the angst about the place of the Jem'Hadar as sentient beings in their own right."

0,"When I first saw the Last Jedi I walked away not knowing if I was disappointed or if I enjoyed what I just watched. I had really gone in expecting Luke Skywalker to do amazing, badass stuff. I was really pissed at his character's treatment in the movie. This was not the Luke Skywalker of my childhood. This was not where I believed his arc should have gone.

Then I re-watched a second time, and even a third for Rise of Skywalker. After a little time had gone by found myself actually really enjoying his treatment. I think I was almost more angry at the character than I was at the writers. I was so disappointed in Luke. He had given up and become a sad version of what he used to be. And then suddenly I thought to myself, ""Wait a minute. That's actually pretty cool. He's not really your hero anymore he's a broken, angry hermit.""

That actually made the character far more interesting to me in retrospect. I think the writing was so good what I was disappointed in was not the film but Luke himself. I liked that the movie forced me to deal with that. 

Anyway, I'm babbling I just thought I would throw that out here into the Redditverse to discuss."

0,"I see a lot of complaints from people about the character “Geode”, a character written by Claudia Gray. It’s almost exclusively criticized by people who never read Into the Dark. You can argue that making a character a rock is not creative, and you might have a point if the author were unable to write this character in a way that captures a reader’s interest. Fortunately, Geode was written by Claudia Gray, and she is the type of author who can make a rock interesting. Geode becomes a source of interest and amusement as the main character is unsure if Geode is actually a living being who is navigating the ship, or just a weird prank. Gray of course doesn’t give much away about his nature, and the main character continues to be confounded as Geode will just kind of show up places, despite not witnessing his movements.  My point is that criticism of this writing choice is really just meaningless if you haven’t read the book."

Is it just me... or are starships supposed to be... ya know, air tight? Like ESPECIALLY the places that Osyraa orders the Viridian to target? And so... basically immune to any kind of biological attack? Or am I being dumb?"
0,"Considering that this is taking place immediately after Order 66 I’m not confident we will, but I’m 100% open for it.

0,"I've always seen Vader as the bad guy just from my memory watching the movies as a kid. I just rewatched 1-6 again and from the prequels mainly, I get the impression Anakin/Vader see himself as a necessary evil once he goes dark side.

For me the final nail in the coffin of my theory is how he goes and slays the Younglings in the Jedi Temple. He does it on his own. Why not just have the clones dispatch them easily? Why walk in there and do it personally? I don't think it's fair to associate it to psychopath/sociopath etc, that doesn't match his character because he's made several decisions (mainly leaning on the clone wars cartoon) that go against him being that way. I think he does it so no one else has too.

Additionally I can't think of any point in time where Vader has gone and slaughtered or killed anyone who is completely innocent. Only ever soldiers or Jedi, you could argue they are innocent, but I mean from Vader's point of view they are not. They're disruptions to the peace of the Empire."
1,"I like seeing the formation and introduction of Trek standards that are common place in other shows, I'm enjoying seeing the formative period of Star Fleet, and the fact that the actual away missions themselves cause the conflict and problems in the episodes because it's not so easy to transport somewhere, or replicate this or that, and there's not just an automatic universal translator eliminating communication issues. 

I'm sure the decline or shitness of the show will become evident to me as I go long but I don't expect to be that bothered, I find the premise fascinating as a fan of Trek and would love to know what others think of Enterprise in depth, as I love reading other's opinions on Trek. 

So far the only big peeve Ive had is I'd like some more colourful uniforms."

1,"Even during the dominion war starfleet was using ships that were from the late twenty third century.  Excellisor, miranda, class, etc.  So why decommission the constitution class.  They were really slow.  On the next generation warp scale their top speed was warp six point five.  But they probably could have improved their engines.  And they were somewhat heavily armed for their era.  The twenty third century ships still in use in the twenty fourth century may look the same but their technology and weapons had been updated.  So why decommission them.  "

0,"It's a common saying that no one hates star wars more then a star wars fan. But I cannot muster any hatred to Star Wars. Or any movie in general? I just cannot get mad about a movie. Regardless of how good or bad I think it is.

Is this a bad thing?"
0,"I know we love theorizing about Star Wars and trying to find ""leaked"" information to speculate on, but the fact of the matter is that about 95% of Star Wars channels that report ""leaked"" stuff are lying. They make up stories, leaks, and news for clicks and other similar channels and website cite them as a source to perpetuate their own clickbait. 

I know a lot of us luckily recognize this reality, but this is also a general Star Wars subreddit and I've seen a lot of people rightly confused and trying to get clarity on a variety of false rumors on here.

Just last/this week people are raging on Youtube about Brie Larson being in Star Wars, and all the information traces back to a singular source who has reported similar stories on and off for about 2 years now, claiming she's been hired and fired 4 time (sometimes by George Lucas who somehow manages to keep reinstating himself as head of Lucasfilm...) for nebulous movies/tv shows and other projects. I'm not joking. That's not even taking into account his hundreds of false leaks for TFA, TLJ, Rogue One, Mandalorian, etc which one would think would discredit him immediately.

Now of course knowing all that anyone with any degree of common sense could tell this story is false, but that's not what these other sites report. Instead they run the headline that ""Brie Larson is going to be more powerful than Darth Vader"" and everyone floods reddit either freaking out or trying to figure out if this is true or not, when the immediate response should be simple dismissal of the story. They present the source as unbiased and just as valid as any other, and for that reason you really shouldn't trust any non-official site either. They have the common sense to know their source is lying, but just don't care.

A good metric for whether a leak, reveal, or other piece of information is trustworthy is to see if it makes it to the [r/StarWarsLeaks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/)  subreddit. Sources almost always trace back to an official statement from Lucasfilm/affiliates, and the few true  ""leaks"" are treated as such, with posters being far more open to answering questions about how they came across this information. When you can't even get a post approved with a ""Probable BS"" flair, you know its likely a confirmed fabrication.

I know people like watching random channels speculate (I do to) and tell you what they've ""heard"" is going to happen in the next movie/show, but the truth is they will all lie to you, and they'll be the easiest lies they ever have to tell. All they care about is your view and whatever ridiculous story will get you it.

So please exercise a bit of scrutiny, and don't believe most of what you read/watch."
0,"Years ago, during Brian Azarello's run on Wonder  Woman, he changed her origin story to having Hypolita and Zeus bringing Diana to life from a statue of clay. To making Diana the old fashioned way.

What would fans say to having Anakin's origin story changed from Shmi being a hermaphrodite. To Anakin's father being some nefarious dark lord.

Kurtzman and McNamara say there are still “conversations” about a new  “Star Trek” series around Michelle Yeoh’s Philippa Georgiou and the  mysterious Section 31, and there are other “Trek” shows in development  that haven’t been previously announced. But they emphasized that the  current five-series slate will likely not expand further until at least one of the shows runs its course.

“We’re very careful about curating the pacing — the number of shows  at any given time — and what those shows are, so that we make sure that  it’s always exciting when there’s a new track show coming out,” says  McNamara. The rough schedule, she says, is to debut “a new ‘Trek’ a  quarter” on Paramount Plus.

0,"When all the other jedi turned their heads in denial as to what actually was going on in front of them and would eventually be their downfall he at least took the time to consider the signs of a greater plan taking place, but that just means he doesn't have his head up his ass as deep as the rest of the council. And at the end, he played his part into the war just like the rest of them.    


He was also involved in letting go Ahsoka, another of the council's mistakes , that they later had the audacity of trying to pass as a test.   


Oh, and let's not forget him leading Ezra, Kanan and Ahsoka to Malachor where they had to fight Vader, Maul and a few inquisitors, which should've been their end and it's a miracle that they got out alive.   


He almost refused to teach Luke because he was ""too old for training"" which considering that there wasn't much options for a padawan and that he was believed to be the choosen one just goes to prove that egocentric attitude that once let Palpatine execute his plan with hardly any obstacles.

1,"It is in the UK. If you saw that clip as your first experience of Trek as a potential viewer you'd never watch a minute of it.

I'm not talking about the whole episode, just the bit where the ""good guys"" kill a bunch of native people who are trying to fight back against the empire's exploitative resource extraction operation on their planet.

If literally any mention had been made of how tragic it was that they had to die so that they could infiltrate the base, I might have been able to excuse it. But there's nothing. Instead the writing just leans on the racist trope of the dumb savage whose life doesn't matter.

I found this choice by the writers to be really disappointing, especially coming out during all this BLM stuff, and it's left a very bad taste in my mouth that is making me have a hard time liking the show overall.

The episode could easily have been written differently without relying on this awful racist dumb savage trope, I have no idea how they could be so insensitive and unthinking to not realize how much this might put people off.

Am I missing anything that anyone wants to point out to me?"
1,"Nana Visitor was in her late 30s, so I guess I figured Kira was meant to be older.

0,"I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a sith legend. Darth plageius was a dark lord of the sith, so powerful and so wise, he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life.  He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be, unnatural.  He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Its ironic that he could save others from death but not himself."
1,"No, this isn't a hate post.   No, this isn't about casting, or social justice, or anything else you think it's going to be. 

What bothers me about Discovery and what fundamentally separates it from all other Star Trek shows is that the epistemology and moral compass of the show is totally missing, which are the core of Star Trek. 

On every other Star Trek show, The Original Series, Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, Picard, the crew would be present with a hard moral choice or quandry.     They'll struggle with it.  The Captain will lead this struggle, carefully weight what's happening,  apply morality and ethics and logic,  and try to do the right thing in a bad situation.  

Sometimes they make a mistake, and they end up being wrong,  but they've always worked together, in at least attempted unity as a crew (with the Captain leading them)   and what always makes them carry the day is carefully weighing what's wright and wrong, really struggling with that choice and challenging what they think is true,  and confronting their own mistakes or shortsightedness. 

on Discovery, that doesn't happen.   Instead, a problem arises, and Burham is always right.   She'll have an instant, gut-reaction to a situation, decide that she's right,  and if anyone tells her otherwise (or, god forbid,  the Captain tells her to stop and gathering information or proceed with cuation)  she'll mutiny, go lone-wolf,  dash off on her own and make unilateral decisions that affect everyone...

And always end up being right anyway.   Her recklessness and an impatience and shortsightedness always end up getting rewarded because she gets proven right.    The Captain (whoever it is)  and all her other crewmates (and maybe even every other character on the show) only exist to tell her ""no"" so she can defy them and then end up being right all along. 

It's basically a show that glorifies rushing off and making irrational decisions without all the facts.   Her first gut-reaction is always the right one and she just spends the rest of the hour slowly being proven right by the story.     This happens over and over,  every episode.    (with the only exceptions being the episodes that weren't about her) 

It feels disingenuous and unfaithful to the core ideas of Star Trek, which were about hard, careful moral choices, about teaching us (The audience)  about the virtues of patience, empathy,  keeping an open mind, and seeing the humanity and value in others, and learning from our mistakes.  

Every Burnham story instead feels like a narcissistic fantasy where only she knows the right way and every other character is just an obstacle to her being proven right. 

I'm not saying this out of ignorance, either.  I've watched just about the whole series.  I'm currently on episode 8 of the 3rd season, but who knows, maybe things will change by the end of the 3rd, but I doubt it. 

But this is the core of, the whole ""It doesn't feel like a Star Trek Show"".    It's this, not any of the other superficial stuff that people complain about.     It's that, fundamentally, this is not a show about struggling with hard moral choices or learning how to see other people as human beings who have value, like every other Star Trek show.  

Instead,  the show is a solipsistic fantasy about one character."

I'd forgotten what that was like. I watched Enterprise and I liked it well enough. I've watched Discovery and Picard, and I enjoyed them too - but I didn't find myself wanting the next episode, and I don't really care when the next series will turn up.

But is DS9 S7 episode 10 It's Only a Paper Moon the most underrated?
We see people bringing up Inner Light and the Siege of AR-558 but I think It's Only a Paper Moon ranks right up there.
In this episode we see a young Nog dealing with PTSD and traditional therapy is not working. When he turns to the holosuite we see it helps him but it also makes Vic realize how much he himself loves life and let's Nog stick around a bit too long before he realizes he has become too reliant on Nog to live but he's only hurting Nog in the long run and forces Nog to confront his inner demons and finally seek true help. The beautiful moment bewteen Vic and Nog when Nog tries to go back in but Vic won't allow it is such a great only in Trek moment. 
This episode deserves a lot more recognition for not only the message but the wonderful performances from Nog and Vic."

Some episodes weren’t that great and I felt like I had to sit through them to get to this point, but the way the writers bring the entire cast together over the previous three seasons to this point where you can really appreciate their camaraderie and dynamics just reminds me of why I love Star Trek. All encapsulated in a two part episode with wit and humour with reminders of what humanity aspires to be - standing up and doing the right thing against the odds.

My buddy said this is the order he watch them: 4, 5, 6, solo, rogue one, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 

My reasoning for starting with prequels is getting to Anakin from the start. The first time viewer already knows the Luke and Vader son and father twist and the general idea of the story. He just wants to watch them all in the most enjoyable way that makes sense. With my way, you can follow the story easier, but with my friends route, it’s a puzzle that you get to dissect. And instead of staring with the slow prequels, you just get to jump into the original. The action, lightsaber fights, and effects also get progressively better and more enjoyable with my friends route.

1,"Hello, I've just started watching the third season of DS9 where we meet ODO's species.

Now we know that Odo took his humanoïd form from the Bajoran scientist that used to study him: same haircut, facial appearance... Except a few details that he couldn't get right such as the nose or the ears.

However when he meets his species, they all take a similar aspect with the same imperfection but also the same ears for example.

Did they tried to take an appearance similar to his to gain his trust, meaning that if Odo had been found by Klingons and decided to look Klingon too, they would have appeared Klingon too? But then, as shape shifters they seem to enjoy perfectly replicating things they encounter, so why did they still look different? As in another person"

When Control takes people over it is very obviously using Borg tech. What if this is just the Borgs' next try at assimilating Earth. This would also make sense in the context of the super-advanced AI trying to destroy all sentient life in Picard. What if the future Michaels mom is trapped in is one where the Borg evolved to the point that they contacted this alternate universe AI and it wiped out all sentient life. This means that something the Discovery does in the past ends up stopping the AI and preventing the Borg from evolving to the point that they can contact the evil race thus saving all sentient life. Boom.

P.S. I am liking Discovery a lot, I don't know what people hate about it. It isn't normal Trek but it's still good and this is coming from a guy who grew up watching TNG."

Have only watched the modern movies, most of the first season of TOS, 13 episodes of Enterprise, and a handful of TNG episodes, so maybe that is it, but the others always seem to come across as angry or pouting instead of emotionless. Of course, can't expect every one to be as good as Nimoy haha, but I think the leader of the monks of P'Jem is the only other one to come as close to being emotionless. Am I the only one seeing that?"

After it ended, I started up DS9 and the beginning really scared me and made me felt dread... What happened to my perfect Gay Space communism? Everything is so dark and broken... well after 3 season I binged it, now its probably my favorite... I like TNG for different reasons so its hard to decide. 

Anyways, this is a question about Enterprise.. I just finished DS9 and decided to start Enterprise.. Im 4 episodes in and I hate it.. I hate the intro song, I hate how the crew is mostly stupid wreckless rednecks with a quarky dr and a hot Romulan. I know 3 characters names. Is this going to get interesting? I like the fact that its showing how the equipment was before gay space communism but that seems to be the only redeeming factor. 

Should I stop now and goto voyager or discovery?  is it worth it to push forward? Am I ever going to see another series as good as TNG or DS9?"

0,"I enjoy these characters and I want them to be continued in a Star Wars Rebels style TV show of just going from one place to another with small conflicts along the way. Rey can go to many Jedi and Sith temples across the galaxy, learning the history of The Force.

Finn and Poe can continue to be leaders of a NEW New Republic or any government left in the galaxy and tried to hunt down the last remaining First Order troops, Poe can be on the side of just hunting them down while Finn tried to convinced Poe that Stormtroopers should be redeemed or at least have rights to be part of the NEW New Republic.

Rose can live a quiet life while also helping the formation of another government with the memories of her sister guiding her across the galaxy.

And Ben isn't really necessary, but he can be brought back as voices or something like what happened to Kanan in Rebels and just screw around with the crew. K I'll admit, I'm one of those people on the Reylo camp especially after Lego Star Wars Holiday Special when Rey said goodbye to Ben.

The cast can be Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, and BB-8. With Chewie, and Maz as supporting characters, while R2 and 3PO become the recurring characters just when the plot needed them.

There's also doesn't have to be a single goal in the show, we never settle down and just enjoy the ride in the galaxy, there's always a conflict that we should get to and we never see the sights when the galaxy is not in any large conflict, other than the pod racing and multiple cantina scenes.

I would like a Slice of Life esque Star Wars adventure, why not? Maybe one episode they went back into Pod Racing, and the next it's about traveling to a Jedi temple on a green planet. Of course it shouldn't just be another anthology show like Clone Wars season 1-3, but having seemingly unrelated stories to be connected in the midpoint or season finales would be cool to watch."

1,"Hi, I am from mexico,  I just got paramount + just to find out there is no star trek, anyone knows why ?"
1,"Discovery and Picard are much higher in budget than TNG/DS9/VOY could ever hope for, but with that, there's been more of an emphasis on explosions, on-location scenes, and generally bigger visuals.

Does Star Trek need this?

Discovery's budget is roughly $8 million per episode. TNG's budget was $1.3 million an episode. I'd argue that TNG has some considerably more memorable episodes than Discovery or Picard (And I happen to like Discovery!) due to the writing.

I'm not saying slash a Trek show to a million an episode. Any new show wouldn't get very far on a million an episode these days, but I do think if the budget was tighter, it'd result in relying more heavily on solid writing, rather than punctuating the story with something grandiose.

Thoughts?"

I don't know much about him, except that he's from one of the older series and there's that meme of him with his hand up about to yell something. Anyway, should I watch any of these old eps or movies beforehand to get acquainted with the characters &amp; story, or will I be alright to just start it with any background?

0,"We know that Star wars (the original trilogy) is considered iconic,legendary and groundbreaking  because of its unique storytelling paying homage to the science fiction film serials of the 1930s  and unique special effects, but there are two trilogies that never receive the ovation like the original ,the prequels and the sequels 

The prequels trilogy which is created by George Lucas  explains the origin of Anakin becoming  Darth vader and the rise of the empire ,It is unique because of its storytelling including the villain like Darth sidious and it even led to spinoffs related to the prequel trilogy that takes place in the clone wars like the clone wars animated series.However, the prequel trilogy is known for its flaws such as Jar-Jar binks ,the characteristic behavior of anakin skywalker in episode 1-3,too much political overtones,the midi-chlorian part  and poor CGI effects in episode 1 

&amp;#x200B;

The sequel trilogy under Disney spearheaded by Kathleen Kennedy and directed by JJ Abrams and  Rian Johnson is the continuation of the saga where it involves new characters battling against a new enemy called the new order  ,It is known for its unique storytelling like its predecessors  with better special effects and even  a cool villain like  Kylo ren .However, the sequel trilogy is known for its flaws it copies the storyline of the original trilogy,ruins what makes the original trilogy special,some of the plot lines in the sequel trilogy remain unresolved,some think that the protagonist Rey is a Mary sue and the production team didn't come up with the plot of the sequel trilogy from start to finish from the very beginning which is why Disney decided to move on from the sequel trilogy and focus on the high republic billions of years before the prequel trilogy. 

So in this thread we are going to discuss why both the star wars prequel and sequel trilogy never receive the same success of the original trilogy"

0,"In my fanfiction, I have a Dathomirian Jedi. She's still a youngling at the time of this event, but is it possible she could have a similar feeling to what Luke felt on Dagobah before he went to Bespin? And if she told the Order about what she foresaw, would they do anything, and what could the outcome be if they did? It's a shame she's too young to attend the battle, though.

The most obvious possibility I see is capturing/killing Grievous way earlier, maybe get some information about Dooku's motives. But how would it affect the relationship between the Jedi and Opress &amp; Ventress, if at all? Future connotations would also obviously include a lot less hostility from Merrin towards Cal Kestis, which might possibly include finding the Astrium significantly earlier, and that could even lead to safely obtaining the Bogano holocron long before the Empire discovers the planet, meaning the holocron never gets stolen. That wouldn't exactly change the end result, due to the vision in the mirror... But, you know, it would make an overall difference outside of that, right?

In any case, I'd love to know exactly what would happen if the Jedi knew about the Battle of Dathomir, depending on whether they would interfere."

1," I started my journey in Star Trek last year seeing the two seasons available for Discovery, then I started TOS (in its glorious slow pace, something I came to admire), ENT (and all its history of origin for the Federation) and it was in the third DIS season was when things changed my perception. I loved the first two and now that I have acquired an experience in this universe I saw how something started to bother me, Burham being Spock's sister. It seems that it was something that was only put in the series to serve as a lure for people who saw only the new films or who had a reasonable knowledge of ST. Do not get me wrong please, I think the series has very good points and it was a great way to be reborn ST in this new era, but Michael didn’t need to BE Spock’s sister, this is just a silly retcon to get attention through media. Okay, I ignored it and moved on, I started watching TNG (I'm loving all the dynamics that the team has and its subhistories) and some days I'm seeing LD and well ... after everything I've seen from Star Trek, that definitely not, of course I understand that this is an animation with an emphasis on comedy and I agree that it has wonderful jokes, but most seem to be something straight from the last season of Rick and Morty? (The one where they made Rick become a God why, yes? \[and the fans\]) (disclaimer: i still watch Rick and Morty, but the way the show is turning in the last season is not good) Returning, the main characters mostly spoil the series entirely with a model of humor and jokes worthy of a bully or a teen comedy movie ""nerdie"". The Cerritos and the design of both the characters and the ""costumes"" are incredible but the people are urgh. I'm sorry I came here to complain, I just wish I could be heard and of course be able to be opposed if someone has a different view than I thought. Thank you for reading this far, have a long and prosperous life!   
P.s. English is not my main language so i use google translator."
1,"As an non US viewer, i am a little more sensitive to identify the cases of 'human values' = 'USA values' presented in the episodes. 99% is just a little odd but the Xindi Attack is the mother of all 'Humanity is the USA' since Independence Day. I can't rub off the felling of watching American Sniper in the beginning of the season. Is very well documented that TOS was a child of its time but in the early 2000s i thought the writers would be more clever not to go for such a reactionary direction with the show. Before watching ENT i was in the impression the first season would be the worst but i gonna put this season as the worst for me.
PS.: I like the show and loved the 4th Season. Is a un-ironically real shame the show was canceled."
1,"Seriously, him and his team have done such an incredible job on the expanse (which is easily the only good sci-fi show going these days) 

With the Expanse ending after its 6th season I think it’d be a great idea to get him and as many of his team as possible over to Star Trek."

[This is where I got the idea for the original panels from Dr. Sci-fi](http://drscifi.com/blog/dswall)
2 4x8’ 1/4” birch plywood panels
10 2x4s
4 2x2s
64 feet of led lights
2 4x8’ panels of 2447 white translucent acrylic
2 4x’ foot 3/4” sandeply plywood
2.5” and 2” cutting drill bits (I don’t know the proper name)
Jig saw
Hand saw
Plug in drill
Orbital sander 
1.26” neodymium magnets
1 gallon each (in order of decreasing darkness) Behr Binary Star, Intergalactic, Zero Gravity, Millenium Silver) paints
For the main panels I found a pdf template online. I then decided I wanted some depth so I attached this 3/4” plywood to the back walls via the studs by screwing them in. The angular bulkheads are attached to the main panels by strong magnets on top and just set next to them on the bottom. This way I can access the lights fairly easily. There is a 2x4 frame behind each large panel anchored into the wall studs. 

Things I’ve learned while doing this (I have hardly any carpentry skills):

Make sure your 2x4s are straight when you buy them. I didn’t and it made things complicated. 

When using a jigsaw on plywood, have the surface you want to be smooth facing away from you. The blade will tear up the surface facing you. 

Make a diagram on how you want to create things
I used a free computer program. 
Birch plywood is smooth but has a lot of holes that need to be filled or can cause cracking 

Countersink your magnets if possible for a more flush look (I need to go back and do this)

Most of all have fun and if you have a child, this is a great project to work on together!"

0,"I am writing a script for a StarWars related idea. LMK if anyone is interested.  


I want to make a (preferrably animated) series or film about a younger Count Dooku. Showing his training by Yoda (maybe doing a scene where Yoda takes young Dooku to get his lightsaber crystal).  Dooku wrestles with the ideas of the Jedi and thinks many of them are good, but sees himself are more morally grey.  I am writing a parallel with Dooku and Anakin.  (I have a Yaddle cameo.  Giving us a little bit more about the Child's race.)  


Anakin, having one of the best jedi (Obi-Wan) as his mentor really helped him stay on the light side longer than he might have.  And Qui-Gon giving his life for Anakin to be able to be trained was self-less.  In my story, Dooku is taught by Yoda, and then receives a perfectly selfless apprentice, (Qui-Gon) which completely makes him see the good in everything.  Qui-Gon shows him that the Jedi ARE the better option.  


But then Qui-Gon dies at the end of Phantom Menace.  I want this to be the instigating force that causes Dooku to see the sith as the better option, gaining the moniker Darth Tyrannus.  The series or film would also show his choice of Ventress as a dark apprentice highlighting the difference between his reasons for choosing her and Qui-Gon.  


this could be a great way to add a layer of drama to the events of the prequel trilogy.  Christopher Lee's voice was enough to warrant all of this  :P  


I am open to finish this if i see any interest.  #DaveFiloni #Disney #StarWars #CloneWars #CountDooku"
1,"So I downloaded the ST:TOS theme and screensaver for my Roku.  The screensaver is just a slideshow of art and production stills from the show.  However there's this one pic that keeps coming up that makes me wonder every time.  In the scene Scotty is manning the Transporter controls and Kirk, McCoy, and some unnamed crewman are on the opposite side of the controls with their backs to the transporter platform.  It looks like Kirk is getting ready to say something to Scotty.  However in the foreground (on Kirk's right) is McCoy and he's not paying attention to the rest, he's looking off to the side like he's lost in thought and has like a half-grin on his face.  I keep wondering what is he grinning about?  It must be a still from an episode but which one?"

So I just finished Dark Lord of the Sith comic series by Charles Soule. In the last issue, Vader is in Mustafar and enters something like World Between Worlds. His soul travels through this ""world"" and it shows all of his life, including a pregnant Shmi with Palpatine in the background. This to me implied Palpatine was involved with Anakin's creation somehow, which would mean his life was pre-determined to turn to the dark side, right? Or did Anakin just fall to the dark side because of his own choices, the arrogance and treatment by the Jedi Council, etc? 

Charles Soule called this part like a message from the Dark Side. Like, hey Anakin, your life was destined to turn this way. Forget about the past, forget about Padme, you can never save her, just embrace being Vader, it's your destiny."
1,"Hello all. I'm wondering if anyone has figured out how long groups episodes are shown for on Pluto TV's Star Trek chanel. I haven't watched it much in a month or so but it's a chanel I like to have on in the ""background"" as I do some other things. For a while I thought that they were showing old TNG episodes in blocks of several episodes that would get repeated for days and weeks on end then I wasn't so sure. 

Today I turned it on briefly and noticed the same episodes as before. I'm not complaining I just want a better idea of how it works. Also, will they be showing DS9 eventually...Voyager etc too? I know it has shown Star Trek movies and The Captains documentary before (repeating every so often too). 

I have Paramount+ so I can watch the stuff whenever anyway but I like the nature of the Pluto TV station too, like I said before, as background. I'm just looking for more info if anyone has it. Thanks.🖖"

0,"I have this weird obcession with this TV show I imagined for Star Wars and was wondering if anyone else has their own shows they would like to see. Could be some concept or a fully developed idea with casting and everything. Here's mine

**Star Wars: Destroyer** \- 4 episodes mini-series with a dark tone (I'm picturing the cinematographer of HBO's Chernobyl). 

6 months after the destruction of Death Star II and the death of Emperor Palpatine the Empire is in turmoil. The Imperial Star Destroyer Resolution has been forced to retreat over and over again and morale is low. Captain Jeffrey Wright (I don't have names for the characters) is considering if the Imperial cause is still worth it, and just wants to do well for his crew. First Officer Michael Fassbender had a sister on the Death Star and is more committed than ever to the war. 

They then receive a secret transmission for a top secret mission. They are to travel to this isolated Star System where a rebel ship is stranded and destroy it. They are to leave no survivors. They are to pick up a elite squad of Death Troopers who have been particularly trained to deal with this specific and undisclosed threat. The head of the squadron is lieutenant Wes Chatham (Amos from the Expanse) and tensions grow between his men and the Stormtrooper garrison within the ship. 

As tensions escalate and morale drops, will the Resolution even reach its destination in one piece? And who exactly is this rebel they have been tasked with killing?"
0,"Obi-Wan throughout all forms of media really has the best rogues gallery when compared to other main characters. 

While not extensive, he has some pretty formidable reoccurring enemies:

General Grevious: Obi-Wan was equally the best and worst person to fight him. His defensive style made him perfect to face Grevious in saber combat, but weaker force connection made it harder to just attack Grevious with the force.

Dooku: Qui-Gon Jinn connection. Regularly face each other throughout clone wars and movies.

Anakin/Vader: Do I need to explain? The opponent he’s fought the least, but also the most emotional conflict.

Maul: “Man too angry to die.” A constant thorn in Obi-Wan’s side."
0,"I know they've been out for awhile, but I recently had a friend who hadn't seen any Star Wars movies other than TFA, so we've been slowly watching them when we can. I was having some discussions with some of my friends as to which sequel is the best, and I wanted to hear more opinions on Reddit. 

First off, I'd like to say that I enjoy TLJ and loathe TRoS. I've noticed that a lot of people hate TLJ because ""it doesn't setup for TRoS"", but TLJ was actually planning on a different script for Episode 9. So I honestly feel that is the fault of TRoS more than anything. 

I also get that a lot of people are upset about Luke's character in TLJ, but I think that it makes sense due to the buildup of TFA. When watching TFA, I was thinking, *Why is Luke not showing up to help with the First Order? They just obliterated billions of people, and Luke didn't sense all that death?* The only explanation I could think of for Luke not appearing in TFA is because he's disconnected himself from the Force or he's busy doing something more important (what would be more important than saving billions of people, I don't know).

I guess I could go on to express my feelings of TRoS, but I guess I'll leave it there. I suppose this post is more about my defense of TLJ, but oh well."
1,"Does anyone know why this episode wasn't an actual Dominion War story? There was a built-in enemy for the episode and instead they use the Romulans? And not only that, but the Romulans steal a Starfleet vessel, getting into a rather destructive skirmish with Starfleet, and then not long after, join the war on the Federation's side? It doesn't mesh well with the rest of the DW arc. 

I'm sure some producer or network exec said the story should have an established Alpha Quadrant race, but even so, I would think the solution would be obvious. Make the enemy the Cardassians. They're established not only as an Alpha Quadrant race, but also as an enemy for the characters on Voyager. 

The half-hearted reference by EMH Mark II about being at war with the Dominion but now we're fighting the Romulans always feels jarring to me, even though the rest of the episode is pretty stellar."

2) how did it not run into voyager like all the time as it went just as far as them? 

3) how did they get that far? I assume both of the voyagers couldn’t have gotten a borg trans warp coil.

I’d really like opinions on what order we should watch the movies in, given she doesn’t know the storyline. I’m leaning towards starting at episode 1 for maximum emotional rollercoaster ride, but SIL recently watched the movies for the first time and thinks we should follow the release order. WHAT DO YOU RECKON?!"
1,"Let's say the people of a planet were tired of the constant war and chaos in space.  Because space is a nightmare.  There are very few episode in star trek where they go somewhere and they aren't shot at.  And then you have the natural hazards and space anomalies that make space a nightmare.  Space anomalies that pop up out of nowhere and drive people insane, crazy space entities, whacky transporter malfunctions that most likely wouldn't happen in normal circumstances, etc.  And then of course you have the borg and dominion.  People from the other side of the galaxy that leave destruction everywhere they go.  So let's say they took one look at starfleet's mission reports and decided to adopt a siege mentality.  Because space is crazy.

So they build the best warships and the best planetary defense system that they could.  They build weapon platforms in orbit and surface to space cannons on the ground.  And if they could acquire the technology a planetary shield.  And a minefield.  A cloaked minefield  So that anyone who approached their planet would hit mines and be destroyed.  They could leave one way clear of mines so that their ships and friendly ships could still leave.  And move the mines every now and then to change it so no one finds out about it.   Do you think this is a valid strategy for keeping the hostile aliens at bay.  Would it work against the borg or dominion.  Let me know in the comments."
0,"May people have critizized the Prequels, hate them, and said that the story and dialogue was terrible. 

And I hear and respect that, and I see why you do very well, but here is why it actually isn't as bad as you think. 

This is my defence of the Prequels. Hopefully I'll change your mind. Maybe I won't. But here is explaining everything stupid in the Prequels, and how it's actually masterfully conveyed:

The story despite being wonky is actually brilliant when you see how it fits in with the original Trillogy. And not the whole Yoda fighting with Chewbacka and other bits of fan service but the actual main story is brilliant.

The 1st movie shows us the Prequel Era. It shows politics, how the universe worked back then, what the jedi were like and many other exotic planets such as Naboo. We are informed of the Prophecy and the Chosen One and that anakin is the key. Its not a perfect movie but it shows us all about the politics which is crucial to the story and the chosen one prophecy.

Second movie - extremely important to Anakin's arc as well as some others. We get to see beautiful neon planets that are just amazing, fantastic scenery and environment as well as an amazing atmosphere. It focuses on Anakin and Padme's awkward yet string relationship flourish. 

Now I know what you're thinking - the writing for that was terrible, but actually it wasn't, or at least kind of wasn't, as George done that on purpose to convey how Anakin has never dated anyone before and was a former slave. In a way, he nailed that awkward dialogue and Hayden Christiansen Done a wicked on portraying it.

Anyway we see Anakin witness the death of his mother, which is such an Underrated scene. That was the Birth of Vader, his first coming, Anakin's first turn towards the dark side. He slaughtered the Sand people showing his Vader come loose, and then is comforted by Padme.

In the novelization of this it explains that despite Anakin seeming very mentally channged and having issues she loved him becuase of how honest and open he was to her. So that whole ""Not just the men, but the woman and the children too"" scene was a great display of that, and that is ironically when she truly fell in love with him for not lying and being open.

We then see the birth of the Clones and Jango Fett and see the battle of genesis, which even people who didn't like the movie have to admit was awesome to see.

Next we have Revenge of the Sith. It's not my favourite Star Wars movie, but it's a brilliant underrated piece of work. I mean it's messy, and it was rushed because it was the living defenition of George wanting to climax this fantastic story with only one movie which didn't go smoothly, but we'll address that later*.

It starts with Anakin's trial that mimics Vader's final confrontation with Luke, and the emperor urging Anakin to kill Dooku. This was a excellent test of anakin loyalty, and where Luke would provail Anakin would fail and kill Dooku, coming more to the dark side.

The Anakin sees visions of Padme's death, his whole motive in the movie. This is why his mother dying in Episode 2 was so important. He felt he couldn't save her and would do anything not to lose padme too. He  wouild be manipulated by Palpatine who uses anakin's emotions to turn him dark. At the same time anakin sees he is being treated unfairly by the jedi and feel like they have abandoned him because of his urgency to save padme.

So the movie plays out how it does. Anakin finds out palps is a sith Lord, reports it to Mace. Obi-Wan 1 shots Grievus, a fine addition to Kenobis kill count  collection and Yoda helps the wookies invasion. This is important not becuase of anything to do with wookies but to show why Yoda wasn't present on the council when they confronted Palpatine.

When they did he obviously kills them. Yeah, the scene could of been a lot better and there have been many explanations to why the jedi masters died so fast but its not the highlight of the movie.

Right, so Anakin shows up and sees Mace deflecting the soon to be Emperor's Force Lightning. And this next scene is so misunderstood.

Anakin doesn't randomly turn to the darkside and betrays the jedi in 3 seconds, it's all about a choice.

What Anakin saw was the jedi who only got in his way, the person who denied him master** (yes, that scene was important too, I'll get to that) or the person who could save the one thing he cared about. Mace was gonna stop him from saving padme, and ultimately Anakin never made a choice. He literally just acted on impulse and stopped mace, who was then ""killed"" by Palps.

Anakin is now unsure of Everything. He realised what he has done and before he can comprehend it Palpatine uses padme to sway him to the dark side, and accepts. He never wanted to be a sith Lord, he just wanted to save padme and be happy. But there is more now.

At the Emperors side he could overthrow him, save padme and rule the galaxy. That's all he'd of ever wanted and explains Darth Vader's random offer to Luke in THE iconic scene.

He accepts and even murders Younglings to achive this goal. He then comes to padme.

Now I admit this scene seems pretty stupid when you see it. Anakin taking to padme and her just rejecting him, but let's think about it.

His whole life flipped upside down 5 times after mace. That's like if you decide to accidently kill the present and form a coup, you're whole life has changed.

His emotions were racing and he saw this golden light of Everything he's ever wanted and without question was trying to get to it. He was irrational, put of his mind, he couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He was extremely conflicted between 5 different things at once, and his brain physicaly couldn't handle all that's happening.

Then padme rejects him. The light is gone. His whole motivation is gone, and he's too confused and conflicted to see why, he literally was blind to himself  from greed.

This is where it begins. Anakin's rampage. He literally loses it.

He chockes padme, duels Obi-Wan in the greatest duel in Star Wars history, not to mention the most emotional by far.

This whole battle he's blinded by his lust for power and having it all crumble aways. He can't think properly and ends up with all his limbs chopped off.

Meanwhile this while time Palpatine has geniusly activated Order 66, and has taken over the senate.

This is what the PHANTOM MENACE was for. It showed EXACTLY how Palpatine became a Galactic Emperor and took over the Senate, a fantastic twist. He duels Yoda in a duel that leads to Yodas exile (again, could of been handled better but were running low on time and the original Trillogy has to be set up in every way.)

Then the epilogue. Luke and Leia delivered in both ways, Anakin becomes Vader truly and Anakin is now dead.

This scene is exactly what I've been saying. Anakin was SO overwhelmed he couldn't even remember his conversation with padme, his mind was just so twisted and conflicted its like he was drunk. He shouts ""NOOOOOOO!"" in horror of his actions and now having lose EVERYTHING he just gives up and severs the emperor.

Let's expand on this now. So the movie is done. If you haven't noticed a lot of it didn't make sense because lack of context. George wanted to tell the story but didn't have enough time but settled for this.

*Then the clone wars released and fixed so much.

One of the bets things it showed to contribute to this movie was the council.

Specifically when Ahsoka was found guilty for the bombing of the Temple.

Remember that really badly written line ""From my point of view the jedi are evil"" that came randomly from anakin's mouth and no-one knew Why?

This is a good example. The clone wars showed how the council treated Anakin and gave insight to why he was this way.

So that combined with him being put of his mind from rage, greed and betrayal, let's call it anakin's rage daze, this explains his absurd behaviour and dialogue.

Look at Padme and Obi-Wan's reaction. They are both confused with what the heck anakin is talking about because they don't know about what actually happened to Anakin.

**In the novelization of thr movie it explained Anakin wanted the master rank to enter masters-only section of the Jedi archives about ways to save padme.

This explains the whole ""Its outrageous, it's unfair"" which want part of anakin's daise, but his anger against the council for not helping save padme, making him hate the council more.

And yes, I know, George didn't plan all this during making the Prequels because he was so caught up with just telling the story.

3 movies wasn't enough to show the whole plot and the clone wars bridged the gap between this and fixed that lack of context.

All of this isn't exactly explaied much in the films, so everyone who's reading this and hate the Prequels again I understand why, but look at the context here. It wasn't stupid, besides Jar Jar, it just want told fully.

This build a Star Wars Universe that wasn't done in the original Trillogy. I truly do love the Prequels.

Yes they could have been done a lot better, yes they have many flawed but they were planned, but it want all made for money (besides Jar Jar).

And for one of my best arguments of what they are great: Their impact on the Original Trillogy.

No, I'm not tailing about you all complaining they made Vader whiney, or made Yoda a super skilled lightsaber warrior which you all hated for some reason and made Yoda and Chewie know each other. Not that impact.

I'm talking about Return of thr Jedi. I'm taking about everything in that film with Luke and Vader. The Prequel knocked it out of thr Park with tieing it in.

Luke trying to redeem Vader, fighting him, dueling him trying to bring him to the light, all amazing on their own but with the Prequels it feels so... Complete.

It makes so much more sense.

On the original Trillogy when the film released no-one knew who really anakin was besides Lukes jedi father and later revealed to be Vader himself. This all seemed like a good plot point but not something thrle fans understood 100%.

With the relase of Revenge of the Sith, take a look at all I've said.

Anakin's entire struggle with the dark side, his betrayal by those he loved and his tragic decent to become vader. Think about how we feel sorry for anakin, how he's been tormented his whole life to live as Darth Vader, a slave to Palpatine.

Then we see Luke talk to anakin, bring him back, almost calling to Episode 3 anakin. I can't describe in words now fantastically this fits in together.

Like I know George has a vision for it all but jesus christ, the way it feels like Luke is speaking to Hayden Christians Anakin years before he was cast as the role is amazing. Luke bring Anakin back and even makes him fulfil the prophecy which all makes sense now.

In the End Anakin, not vader, years before Anakin's debut fulfils the propechy. With Anakin's whole story written in the Prequels it finally comes to a climactic end with Vader's sacrafice, taking off the mask, almost a love letter to the Prequels. The way Episode 6 played out it was almost like the Prequels did come before.

In the end we finally see Anakin free, years before we we saw how important that was, and Episode 6 truly tired up all loose ends showing even if you didn't like the Prequels they are so essential to the plot of thr original Trillogy that's what makes it even better."

0,"Anakin would have become 10x more powerful than Vader if he hadn’t turned to the dark side. Turning to the dark side is a weakness, because only the weak cannot resist it. That’s why Obi-Wan beat Anakin in Revenge of the Sith, he was stronger and could resist the dark side, he only lost later in ANH because he was very old. Also that explains how Luke could beat him in ROTJ. The light side is stronger, so if he stayed in the light he would have become stronger. The light always wins.

1,"This might be an unpopular opinion and I'll probably get downvoted for this. I've been re-watching Star Trek TNG and DS9 for over a decade now and I never really paid much attention to how morally questionable Lwaxana Troi's behavior is. I'd always loved it when she came on the show. It was always a hoot watching Deana get all embarrassed by her. I immensely enjoyed episodes where her character would make an appearance.

This re-watch around I've been watching the show a bit more critically and it dawns on me how unpleasant of an individual she is. I know she's a character written for a show in the 90s as comic relief(and some serious ones too) and maybe I'm reading too much into this.

She's portrayed as this lovable and empowered woman who's a Federation ambassador and the mother of a beloved character. She's the auntie we all love. She's had a lot of powerful and fantastic moments on the shows which is all great. But.... she doesn't respect the personal boundaries of people. It seems that consent as a concept is completely lost to her. 

She reads people's minds using her Betazoid telepathy without their consent which is a massive violation of privacy. I have social anxiety and this is the kind of person that I'd dread running into IRL. In fact, I've known people like this who brush off their behavior like some personality quirk even if it's seriously affecting the mental health of people around them. 

In TNG, she's constantly hitting on Picard, reading his mind, and making him visibly uncomfortable. She makes inappropriate comments towards crew members and doesn't seem to have a filter. She can't take a hint which is even worse as she's a telepath and she can literally know and feel what someone is thinking.

A lot of the times Deana is mortified. Maybe there's a double standard. Imagine if your older father visited your place of work and started hitting on your boss and other younger co-workers. He would immediately be seen as a total creep and even kicked out of the place.

In DS9, Odo was seriously freaked out by her advances to the point that he had to complain to Sisko, who then completely trivialized it like it wasn't even an issue. She was practically harassing him and following him around the station. Odo was literally pleading to be left alone. I know the episode had a happy ending but I don't like the message that it sends. That it's okay to wear down someone until they give into your advances.

She's been racist towards Worf on more than one occasion. She even says that Klingon brains are too primitive to be capable of telepathy. As if telepathy is an indicator for a species' sophistication. She's clearly elitist about being a Betazoid and some kind of telepathy supremacist. Deana even rebukes her that it's common courtesy not to communicate in telepathy when there are non-telepaths around. She completely disregards it.

The shame is that I really liked her character before and these moments are really ruining it for me. I feel like skipping the parts wherever she comes on. What are your thoughts on this? Am I nitpicking this or does anybody else feel this way too?"

This episode has been one of my favourites so far. Although I'm not a religious person, they way they depict Neelix's crumbling faith was well done and made me sympathise. It's nice seeing the actor of Neelix getting more serious moments.

The issue with the episode is the introduction of the life saving Borg technology.  
I am not done with Voyager yet, but there is probably a 90% chance someone will die at one point and the Borg technology will be conveniently forgotten about."
1,They happened to be giving this episode on TV today and I decided to watch it while I was doing something else. It’s not one I particularly enjoy but it has something that I never realized before.

* There is also a biology sciencey comment that Stamets works in, about Fungi being the recyclers of the universe, when he's talking about seeing Hugh.
* Using the redshift to help determine the position of the signal - again, real science.
* It deals with religion in a pretty mature way.
* Wish fulfillment, in the scene of Pike talking to Jacob.
* There is no intentional villain
* Burnham does not save the day, instead it's ""May"" / Tilly. It's a bit embarrassing that the rest of Discovery's crew sat there for an hour and was still coming up with ideas like ""let's shoot the asteroids"". Like c'mon, use the deflector dish or something.
* The ship shots are unusual, and that's a good thing. There are some novel shots of Discovery that are very interesting.
* Both Owosekun and Detmer get at least some level of overt participation in the solutions on the planet and in space respectively. Airiam is mentioned by name iirc. Bryce and Rhys don't do much beyond acting as an extension of their station.
* Though the plot is still ""everyone on the planet is gonna die"", there is at least a logical reason for why Discovery happens to be there when that is the case.
* Also, though it's totally minor, it's nice that there is some justification behind Owosekun (a bridge officer) being selected for an away mission."

0,"In RoTS Yoda tells Kenobi that he will not send him to kill Darth Sidious because he isn't strong enough to engage him and he would die a very slow and painful death. I am going to lay out the reasons why I think Yoda was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

1. His lightsaber forms. He used forms 3 and 4, with Mace Windu even acknowledging that Obi-Wan wasn't just a master of Soresu, but THE master. His defense was impenetrable and many have stated ""Defense just prolongs the inevitable"" as a point against Obi-Wan but he used forms 3 and 4 hand in hand. He would defend himself long enough to tire his enemy out and use Ataru to strike when he saw the opportunity. Obi-Wan's style has proven to be very lethal in pure 1 on 1 combat. 
2. His combat. He is no stranger to Sith Lords. We know he knows how to block force lightning and he has faced and successfully defeated more Sith than any other Jedi in the last 1000 years. We saw this when he blocked Dooku's lightning with his lightsaber. He was also even able to defeat Anakin in his prime and on top of that, we saw his strength in the force even rivaled Anakin's when they attempted to force push each other at the same time and Anakin was the strongest force user in the Jedi order at the time. Anytime Obi-Wan lost a duel it was with other people involved (Anakin). We saw how lethal his style was when he went out and had a very clean 10n1 fight with Grevious, even being able to hold off his insane 20 strikes a second with 4 lightsabers. He's also a quick thinker and pretty clever, as we saw he was able to instantly search for and find a weakness in General Greivous (his hands). He would have no trouble searching for exploits with anyone he faced as he was defending the entire time. Obi-Wan never attacked first, he was purely defensive so when he confronted Palpatine, it was either Sidious striking first (Which if he did, he would have already lost) or they just would not have fought until Yoda arrived in which if that happened, Palpatine would have been truly f\*cked. 
3. Palpatine's weakness. He was over-confident. It was so strong it blinded him and even Luke was able to use this as an exploit against him. Palpatine was shocked at the defeat of Anakin, he didn't think for a second Obi-Wan could have defeated him. So there is no doubt he would have seriously underestimated Obi-Wan which would have been his downfall. Obi-Wan most likely would not have picked up on this and used it against him in-fight however, it would only have been one of many factors leading to Sidious' loss. 

The only instance I can see where Palpatine could have defeated Obi-Wan is if Obi-Wan successfully disarmed him and as he went to strike him down Palpatine would catch him off guard and use his force lightning. We know this is a common Sith tactic, both Dooku and Palpatine have done this. (Dooku &gt; Ventress - Sidious &gt; Windu). As far as lightsaber combat goes however, Obi-Wan would have won. I understand Palpatine mastered all 7 forms of lightsaber combat but defensive cannot fight defensive, and Obi-Wan would never have fought offensively. Either Palpatine would take the offense or they just would not have fought and because of Obi-Wan's mastery of Soresu, Palpatine would have lost the second he stroke first. I have no doubt it would be a very, very long battle but it takes more energy to offensively attack than it does to defend. All Obi-Wan would have to do is just wait for his moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I think Obi-Wan would have defeated Darth Sidious."

1,"One of my favorite idiosyncracies of our beloved franchise is despite looking forward to our future, the show is still a product of the time it was made in.

Some of my favorites include:

- P2P communication: Writers came up with sub-space as a way to communicate over vast distances almost instantaneously, but did not scale it down to a shipboard wifi network. Sure you could send messages or date from one console to the next, but Riker is still handing over a padd (""his"" padd?) to Picard for approval instead of a wireless interaction.

- Media and Social Media: The Doctor totes his holoimager around like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Meanwhile, the show ended a few years before the short rise and fall of the digital point and shoot (supplanted almost immediately by both the iPhone and also affordable, higher scale photography gear for the masses). Does anyone in Trek have anything similar to the imager? Or do they find them pointless where you could create your own landscape in the holodeck, or internal sensors can create a more accurate, higher quality image. After all, how do they monitor security footage? Similarly, people communicated face to face a lot, which is much easier in a contained space like Voyager. But what about if Geordi wants to slide into DMs from some woman from Risa--does he have to wait for a dedicated comm window for them to chat? Is the long distance relationship kind of difficult or dead? Today it's hard to fathom *not* texting anyone or being informed about their lives via social media. Or what if B'Lanna wants to mess with Vorik--can she text him on his padd or console?

LowerDecks has kind of retconned this, showing Mariner frequently messaging using her padd

-  Holodecks and personal entertainment: I liken holodeck time like a trip to the movies--between all their work plus the aliens that make their lives difficult, its a nice getaway that would have a much more immersive experience than maybe 2D media or whatever hobbies they have (although the holodeck could harbor any hobby you can think of)...when you can get it. Two holodecks for 120ish people on Voyager? There's enough hours in a week for everyone, but everyone still has to work and sleep, so maybe there aren't. Do I have to wait two weeks for my next recurring holodeck time? Am I limited to what I can do in my quarters? Wait, what can I do in my quarters anyway? Considering there are holoemitters in sick bay (and only recently too), maybe having emitters for each quarters on their own power grid would be akin to having access to streaming, or having a gaming rig."
0,"Hello There.

It appears on my feed videos from the youtuber Mike Zeroh, where he talks about news of star wars that seems that falls from the sky. Every day he relases videos with ""privileged information"" from LucasFilm and Disney. The first time I watched the video I though ""wow, this is shocking"", but then I gave a look to other videos and I understood that everything of that is pure scam  to get views. Still he has so many view per video that  puts me triggered. 

Anybody follows this youtuber here?"

1,"Several years ago there was a Risa Social Media platform. Originally it was just STO players and such. I was there for the first couple years. I created the first DS9 group and rewatch on the site. After a while it got tired and boring with only the same people and no new ideas to be found.so I took a break thinking I'd eventually return. I was thinking about some of the people I knew and thought it would be nice to catch up with them. Turns out it's now exclusive to the Amazon app store and there are no reviews that are even remotely recent.

My best guess is that CBS killed it rather than it growing and improving. The site predated the death of the fan fic, among other losses suffered by the lawsuit I won't rehash. I wasn't there for its downfall, so I'm just wondering what exactly happened and when it lost its structural integrity."
0,I just realised that all 3 of the Original Trios arcs are based around how they cope with becoming old. Han retreats back to his youth. Luke resents his youth and Leia embraces her age.

1,"So I was born in the 60s and saw a few reruns of Star Trek in the 70s growing up, but they didn’t capture my attention much. I never understood what the draw was. Anyway, recently I was nostalgic about the 80s and watched Dynasty with Joan Collins which I never managed to finish watching back in the day because I went off to college and didn’t have a TV or time. That’s when I found out she appeared in an episode in Star Trek which I found and watched. I didn’t get it the first time and had to watch it a few more times. I really enjoyed it. Now I know that the only scifi movies or shows I like are ones that make me think, like Blade Runner or Electric Dreams, not the ones about conquering aliens or wars between battleships. I have some questions:

Is this the reason The City on the Edge of Forever is a fan favorite of the entire franchise? That it makes you think?

Why did Spock initially assume McCoy was the one who would save Edith and prevent her death, and not Kirk? They all disrupted the timeline and Kirk would’ve been more likely since he was in love with her.

What other episode of Star Trek do you think would appeal to me, in terms of being more cerebral? I’d like to watch it."

1,"My single favourite instalment of Star Trek is Undiscovered Country. I love it to bits. I love the performances, I love the writing, the music, the atmosphere. Yes, I'll just say it: It's better than Wrath of Khan. FIGHT ME.

But, there is one scene that has always bugged the crap out of me:

UFP President Ra-ghoratreii getting briefed on Operation Retrive, a proposed rescue of Kirk and McCory from Rura Penthe, in his office. An operation that would illegally violate Klingon sovereignty and would quite likely result in the loss of Klingon life, in order to rescue men who have been convicted of assassinating the Klingon head of state. Something that, if it got out, would be absolutely construed by the Klingons as an act of war. And he is doing this incredibly risky thing IN FRONT OF THE ROMULAN AMBASSADOR.

Now, apparently this scene was cut from the theatrical version but it was put back in for home release so as far as I'm concerned it's canon.

So, is this just one dumb scene that nobody thought through logically? Yes, yes it is. And we can either accept that or come up with an insanely elaborate head canon to explain it away. Well, are we Trek fans or are we Trek fans?

So here's my theory: Starting at some point between their last TOS appearence in ""The Enterprise Incident"" and ""Undiscovered Country"" the Federation and the Romulans were not enemies. In fact, they were in a full bore military alliance.

There's little evidence of this, granted, but there's no evidence to contradict it either, as a result of the Romulans being used so sparingly in the movie era. The only Romulans seen in the films prior to Nanclus is Caithlin Dar, the quarter human Romulan representative on Nimbus 3. But that proves that the Romulans were at least engaging with the Federation on a diplomatic level, and that there had been some migration between the two nations in this period so I think it strengthens the argument for a Federation/Romulan alliance rather than weakens it.

Here's a few things that might be explained by a Romulan/Federation military alliance in the 23rd century:

1) Why Romulan aggression doesn't seem to be a worry throughout the TOS movie era.

2) Why the Federation apparently made no effort to develop cloaking technology between acquiring a cloaking device in the Enterprise Incident and signing the treaty of Algernon **43 years later**. Maybe it was a condition of their alliance with the Romulans?

3) Why the Klingons felt they had to militarise to the point that they caused the collapse of Praxis. They've been outflanked by a combined alliance of the Federation and Romulans, just as the USSR was when Nixon went to China (as the ancient Vulcan proverb goes).

4) Why the hell the Romulan ambassador is just chilling in the Federation president's office while this highly illegal operation is being outlined. Because how are those Starfleet troops planning on getting to Rura Penthe? In a cloaked ship, courtesy of their Romulan allies. Nanclus is there because he's an ally, and he's in on the heist."

0,"I have been making my way through a lot of the Star Wars novels out there recently. I read the original Thrawn trilogy and loved it (Heir, Dark Force, Last Command). I read the first in the Bane series (Path of Destruction) and thought that was pretty great too. I have already purchased the second two in the Bane series, but I wanted to take a break from the Sith and read something a bit less dark, hence: Light of the Jedi. 

I'm about a third of the way done with it, but I think it's about to get moved to my DNF pile, which is sad. I find that I just don't care enough about any of the characters or the story happening. And it's so weird because I've actually gotten emotional enough to cry twice in this so far, but I'm just not feeling compelled to finish. I'm not curious about what's going to happen, I only want to make sure I don't miss any big events or characters I should know about for other stories. 

I've been thinking about it, and I'm wondering if it's the source of conflict that's getting me down. So far it just feels too much like a natural disaster story, and the Jedi are all stepping up to try and help people and being a great heroic body of people, but the enemy isn't sentient or deviant yet, and maybe that's what's missing for me? Also, I don't know who the main characters actually are. Who am I supposed to be connecting with? Because a third of the way through, I don't feel particularly connected to anyone in the story. 

So my question is: should I keep going? Are these characters going to grow on me soon? Are we really all the republic? Because for the record, that line is waaaaaaaay overused so far and it's starting to cross over into the annoying category in my head."

0,"I came up with this question right after making some OC's in Hero Forge. One of them is a former sith padawan that, after reuniting with his brother, decided to join him in the Jedi Order. He rebuilds his lightsaber and makes a pair from it. One uses his purified Kyber crystal and the other has a purple one. The idea behind this color choices is to represent that despite finding redemption, there is still remnants of the dark side in him trying to seduce him back. However, due to the nature of the lightsaber colors being usually associated with the wielder (green for consulars, blue for knights, and so forth), I don't know how ""lore friendly"" this is possible. I know of, at least, 3 characters that fit in this case. Which is Pong Krell, Ahsoka Tano before acquiring her white sabers and Revan. So I can't tell if it's just a rare exception or if it's a case of honoring a deceased master or friend by wielding his lightsaber in conjunction with his own. What do you guys think?"

You have propably read these types of posts a hundred times but im gonna keep it short:

I have been watching The Hollywood Reporter's top 25 TNG episodes (never watched anything star trek before), not with the intention to get hooked along the way, just to have a fun time. The episodes included are:

\- Encounter at Farpoint

 \- Skin of Evil

\- Conspiracy

\- The Measure of a Man

\- Deja Q

\- Yesterday's Enterprise

\- The Offspring

\- Sarek

\- The Best of Both Worlds

\- Family

\- The Drumhead

\- Redemption

\- Darmok

\- Disaster

\- The Outcast

\- Cause and Effect

\- I, Borg

\- The Inner Light

\- Relics

\- Chain of Command

\- Trapesty

\- Frame of Mind

\- Paralells

\- Lower Decks

\- All good things

Things that surprised me: 1 I like Q and episodes with alternative timelines (something I thought I was gonna hate). 2 I like all the main characters.

Things that were really bad: 1 Klingons, they are so ugly and cheap looking it's hilarious. 2 If those three are season 1's best, then I understand why that season gets alot of (deserved) hate. 3 It looks awful in many places which I should have seen coming but sometimes it was hard to watch.

Overall it was pretty fun, not planning to watch everything (someday I probably will because I liked the characters, but not in some time). Before this adventure ends however I was wondering if there is one episode that you think I should watch before me and TNG part ways?"

1,"I had thought of a story involving Picard during the Dominion War.  It would start of with him at a starbase near the front getting briefed on a dangerous but important mission, like securing a system that'll cut off the Breen from the rest of the Dominion or something.

Picard first objects that shouldn't an admiral or commodore command a small fleet.

The admiral then tells him it's a joint mission with the Romulans, and they only agreed to Starfleet commanding it if it was Picard.

Picard asks how is this being considered.  The admiral answers Starfleet can't spare enough ships from other sectors and the Romulans are the only ones nearby.  

He also says that only one Romulan officer supported the idea of a joint mission, and again, on the condition that Picard be the ranking Starfleet officer.  That Romulan officer will be Picard's co-commander for the mission.

At this point Picard asks who it is.  The Admiral starts going on ""Captain it's extremely important that this be handled-""

""Dammit Admiral!  Just what double-crossing Tal Shiar infiltrator am I supposed to work with on this mission?!""

The door opens.  It's Tomalak with his devious smile.  ""Jolan Tru...Picard."""

0,"So I've just finished re-watching the sequel trilogy, and one of the things that bugged me the most throughout all three films was the severe waste of potential for certain character developments. 

For me the most glaring examples are Phasma, the Knights of Ren, Rose and Jannah. There is so much potential to flesh these characters out in a meaningful way that would make their various confrontations on screen just that much more impactful. 

Then I thought that these films are created by one of the largest and most successful film companies on the planet and written by some of the most well respected and experienced film-makers in Hollywood. Surely they would know how to write characters and develop them meaningfully...they're not lacking experience of that.

Then it got me thinking about star wars in general and how it's not only a film franchise but a media franchise and they always want to create more books/comics/toys/videogames etc. 

With this in mind could the lack of character development have been intentional so that Disney/lucasfilms could tell their stories in other forms of media? Or was it just bad writing?"

Than Odan Urr created the Jedi library on Ossus in 5000 bby but I’m only if that was actually a headquarter/temple than finally 1000 years later the Jedi temple was created on coruscant so can somebody fill in the gaps for me. Between them leaving Ossus in 20000 bby and the pius dea crusades. Them once again returning to the republic in 11000 bby and the temple on coruscant being created in 4000 bby.

1,"There is this whole episode dedicated to Data, where he goes down on a planet where the radiation is too much for the human crew to handle, to tell it's settlers that they cannot survive an ""alien"" attack. You mean to tell me that this is a ""skippable"" episode? I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I absolutely loved Data in this!

I have fond fond childhood memories of ONLY the first seasons, because TV4, the network who aired it, only aired a few eps of the first, possibly the 2nd as well.

In this season we see how and Q gave his powers to Riker in one episode

Sure, some dialog in the Q -&gt; Powers - Riker, like; ""Is this sex?"" Worf: ""Yes! But I have no place for it in my life now!"" meanwhile hitting or being hit by a female klingon, is a bit on the, eh, tamer side, perhaps... but does it spoil an entire FASCINATING episode? Heck no! :)

I was 10 when these episode aired, in Sweden. And they only showed one or two seasons of episodes, and then claimed they would be back after ""a short while"". That is TV lingo for ""half an eternity"", or in this case: NEVER :(

Luckily for me, after 3 years or so, another network picked up the series :)

BUT, for the LONGEST TIME, I only knew star trek the next generation for it's first season (possibly 2, my memory may be incorrect). And I just LOVED IT!

&amp;#x200B;

It's in these eps where we get to met the traveller, who takes the enterprise to ""the very end of the universe, or the very beginning of it"". I was just FASCINATED.

A lot of people seem to think that a TNG episode needs to have our minds blown each and every time, and while I agree that that is sure a great thing when it happens, I was just PSYCHED for the RIDE that these first few TNG episodes gave me.

What a ride, what a ride :) The quality of the pacing, editing, the cinematic feel to it. Just WHAT was going to happen NEXT on this EPIC scifi series? I had seen NOTHING like it, ever, and this was back in 1990 in Sweden. (Yes, we usually got series 3 years later than in the US).

1,"I resisted watching the animated series until I learned that Majel Barrett, Leonard Nimoy, and Will Shatner along with the original crew did the voices for the cartoon! Starting to get into it.."
1,"1. Discovery just became the single most important asset in the known galaxy in the 32nd century. The most obvious reason is its Spore Drive. Firstly, the fact that it can instantly travel anywhere is game-changing at any period of time. Secondly, in view of the scarcity in the 32nd century, the Spore Drive presents an alternative and viable means of travel. This alone increased the Discovery's importance many times over. The thing that fascinates me about the drive is that, based on my understanding, it isn't as much of a technological advancement, as it is an innovative utilization, in that it does not create or produce anything new, but merely passes through an already existing pathway (Mycelial Network). It would be the equivalent of, say, us running out of fossil fuels, then finding out that our ancient ancestors travelled through continents by riding giant eagles. However, in my opinion, the drive is only the second most important of Discovery's features

2. What I believe is the principal value of Discovery is the Sphere Data, which contains at least 100,000 years of information. I'm surprised this isn't something that was recognized by anyone this season, given that its preservation was the reason they travelled into the future. While the Federation has had almost a thousand years of significant advancement, that amount of time is still but a small fraction of the knowledge within the sphere. It could have data on alternative fuel types, or maybe other galaxy wide transportation methods used by older civilizations. I'm sure it can provide more guidance other than team-building techniques and secret locations of temporal doorways.

3. I'm actually not surprised that the Vulcans left the Federation. They have always had a sense of self-superiority and disdain towards other races, most notably the unpredictable humans, behind that veneer of emotionless faces. Spock himself was a victim of prejudice from pure Vulcans because of his human heritage. They co-founded the Federation mostly out of utility, and I think when they realized after The Burn that it was more work than it was worth, (I sense a small ""I told you so"" moment) they did the logical thing and simply left.

4. Also I'd like to see how Tellar Prime is doing. It is the only Federation founding world unaccounted for. Earth was practically abandoned; the Andorians formed a syndicate; and the Vulcans yeeted out.

5. The encounter on Earth was refreshing, where issues were actually resolved through means beyond the firing of phasers. 

6. Discovery's entry to the new Starfleet headquarters is a bit cringey. The recurring  trait of the crew is their inability to perform professionally. In that scene, they were portrayed similar to how school children would in the Smithsonian. A basic rule is ""show, don't tell"". The perfect example is in the 2009 Kelvin timeline movie, when Bones and Kirk were in the shuttle, flying towards the Enterprise. The music, the cinematography, and the stunned silence of the characters served to paint the epic proportions of the space vessels.

7. Michael's romance was handled really well in this season. The trouble that could be encountered in any show, is the presence of chemistry, of connection, between the two characters. The ideal romance is one that does not make you want to tear your eyes off everytime you see them have a moment. I honestly felt that Michael and Tyler as a couple were a bit off. For me, Michael and Book were actually charming to watch.

8. Philippa's diagnostics actually had more implications than was shown. According to the old scientist guy, every molecule fights to go back to the time it originated, as they were only meant to exist in a certain universe, with a certain time. I think that, while Philippa was the most severely affected because of her unique circumstances, the rest of Discovery's crew is not yet off the hook. We might see the issue arise in the next season. 

9. I was afraid at first that Admiral Vance was just gonna be a viciously corrupt, or alternatively, a dangerously self-righteous starfleet admiral. His advice to Saru, and how he handled Ossyra showed otherwise. I like how most of his scenes subtly demonstrate his soundness, wisdom, experience, and dedication to duty.

10. I also admire the season's well-portrayed antagonists. Zareh was the typical bully: smug, haughty, and abusive. The actor did an excellent job of instantly making the character as having the most punchable face in the entire series. Ossyra, however, cunning and manipulative, was a true threat. It's a pity that Georgiou was taken before Ossyra entered the picture. A fight between the two of them, either commanding their ships, or hand-to-hand, is a show I'd give all the dilithium in the galaxy to watch. It would have been like Napoleon and Wellington.

11. Going back to the Sphere, it is quite odd how easily the ship's systems were overtaken, considering that it is the same one that basically took control of all Discovery's systems in season 2. It shouldnt be possible that it could just be gone into hiding so simply.

12. Tilly, as smart and capable as she is, is not fit for a commanding position. Saru is correct, that she has the heart, but she needs a lot more refinement to be able to focus properly during crises.

13. I'm quite sure the Ni'var would have had the sufficient data from their multiple and widely dispersed SB19 sensors to come up with the same results Discovery had. Any minute differences recorded by the mere three black boxes recovered by Michael should also reflect in the recordings of the Ni'var sensors, unless they were unusually lax in their analysis.

14. I have mixed feelings about the cause of The Burn. I feel like it is off and anti-climactic, considering everything the Federation went through like the Borg, the Dominion, Temporal wars, and other yet unnamed conflicts which undoubtedly happened in the last hundreds of years. On the other hand, it was also apt in many aspects. the cause was so small and insignificant, in a galactic sense, that only it could have brought the Federation down. And while the whole galaxy could discount it as trivial, for Su'kal, it represented his whole world. 

15. One more thing I love is the overall theme of the season, which is connection, that the right move is to reach out and establish connections, instead of closing yourself in. We were shown examples as in the cases of Earth, Trill, and Ni'var, who shut themselves out of the galaxy. However, like Saru's dinner, and Su'kal's opening to the outside, reaching out made them stronger in the face of difficulties.

16. I am pleasantly surprised by Michael and Saru's swift reversal of roles. It was heavily hinted that Michael no longer felt beholden to starfleet, and that her brief taste of freedom from the carrying the weight of an entire ship changed her significantly. I thought that by the end of the season, she would leave Discovery to help rebuild the Federation in her own way, away from the rigidity of the regulations. However, at the end, it was she who found her way further in the organization, and it was Saru who ""needed the time"" to reflect upon his next choices.

17. I do hope we get to see more of the new Starfleet ships in the next season. We barely get more than a jumbled view of them. I hope there is an Enterprise somewhere, like Enterprise-X, although that would imply an Enterprise-W, which doesn't really work. 

18. Furthermore, I hope we get to see more of the individual crew. the problem with the bridge crew is that they're always grouped together, it's easy to make them forgettable. Detmer and Owo did get a few moments of their own, but it's still not enough to consider them memorable.

19. Also, try to find a new catchphrase for jumping to warp lol."

1,"It’s been a few weeks now since Disco’s season finale so I feel like I shouldn’t be spoiling anything for most people. 

With that said, the entire season was a stretch. I mean common, the burn that apparently killed millions and disrupted FTL travel for billions more was caused by a single, for all intents and purposes, normal being. I tolerated that but honestly what kind of really put me off was that turbo lift scene near the end. I mean seriously, I know this ships are supposed to be massive but, Disco is microscopic compared to the Ent-D and we saw nothing on that scale in TNG, even on the ships schematics on the consoles, there is nothing that implies a space like this exists. I know this was shown on the Kelvin Ent but that doesn’t excuse the physical dimensions provided for the ship vs the on-screen implied dimensions.

Maybe I’m just being nit picky but I feel that trek has taken too many random one-off scenarios to answer certain problems (“resurrection” serum for Kirk, advanced tech for voyager, picards new android body, etc).

I know it’s all fiction but I feel like there is such a thing like fiction in fiction and the writers have used it too many times over the years as plot devices, a means to a quick ending, visual effects, etc. I would like to see less one solutions that are never talked about again or writing that is reflective of provided canon information and I would like to think I’m not the only one."

1,"Watching the Voyager episode Scientific Method, I realized that it’s just a repeat of TNG Where Silence Has Lease.  The crew is being used as lab rats by aliens.  When the aliens are exposed, the captain is told that some of the crew may die.  When a crew member dies in front Janeway and Picard, both captains decide to destroy the ship and kill everyone to end the experiment rather than continue to be manipulated.  Janeway flies between two pulsars which Tuvok gives them a 1 in 20 chance to survive and Picard sets the self-destruct, but the solution is really the same with the aliens giving up.

1,"Season 3 of Discovery was highly anticipated because it opened a whole new timeline for the franchise, farther in the future than ever. But also because of the possibility of Saru, who is really a popular character in the show, perhaps even more than its protagonist Michael Burnham, being promoted to captain (which he was) and further developed as a character, and that’s what was somewhat disappointing.

He was portrayed as a weak captain, undecided and shy (inconsistently with his changes in season 2), a poor judge of character and intentions (inconsistently with his whole arc), lacking objectivity in his perspective (even though he demonstrated an impressive capacity fot self control that even improved that during his previous arc) and almost a token to highlight Burnham’s talents by opposition.

It almost seems like the writers, seeing how much Saru is loved by the fandom, gave what they want and then proceeded to “subvert our expectations” (a quote that will always taint Rian Johnson’s legacy, but I digress) in order to sell Michael as the true captain for Discovery, since she is the protagonist of the show.

The problem is, Michael already has amazing feats but even her purposed flaws work for her in the end with no accountability, no character growth, bordering on blockbuster action hero, which is great for a couple hours of entertainment but IMO doesn’t work so good in a TV series format, or at least in Trek (imho).

While weakening Saru so he also becomes an action blockbuster trope - the by-the-book character to be always outshined and schooled by the ingenuity and wit of our great heros - may disappoint a bit the fans who were eager to see captain Saru in all his glory.

Moreover, it seems that the character was sidelined for the next season. I simply don’t see another character as charismatic. They show will surely need one."
1,"I have been thinking a lot lately about how there is so much discourse and frankly, a lot of unreasonable hate towards people who are fans of Disco. I for one cannot stand the show, I can fully admit that I haven't given it a fair chance. Having said that, I found the first two episodes to be unwatchable but powered through them anyway. I couldn't stop finding things to hate/nitpick about it. I wanted it to be good. I got excited hearing about it being put into production. But I dislike the design of the ship, I don't think any of the bridge crew would make it through Starfleet Academy based on their behavior. There are other things I did not care for but I don't want this post to be a list of things to hate on. That is not helpful. Before anyone says ""Oh you just have to get through \*Number\* of episodes, I would like to say that I shouldn't have to watch a show until I get Stockholm syndrome in order to find it enjoyable. I am not expecting every episode to be great tv or amazing Star Trek, Code of Honor happened after all. I shouldn't be held hostage by a show until I think its good. Now I did also watch the episode 5 of season 1, where they notoriously drop a couple F bombs. While that's fine with me I do feel that kind of robs something from Star Trek, after all people are supposed to just be better right? I found the whole scene where they drop the F bomb to be really weird. It felt like the writers had a misunderstanding of this type of scene that has been done in trek for years. People standing around a console talking out their plan as a plot device to keep the viewer informed. But who were they talking to? They all clearly understood the plan already, normally at least one person in the scene is having the plan explained to them so its not quite so weird. It makes sense, the characters are talking to each other. In this scene they just talk at the air and state the plan, for no ones benefit. Now even if the characters are supposed to be flushing out a plan with each other I did not feel that it read that way. Normally I won't fault an actor for a bad script, but this scene I think it was a team effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having said all of this, it took me years to come around on Enterprise. I enjoy it now, but I was very critical of it when it came out but now it is a good series I enjoy. The writing was ok, the characters were underdeveloped and underused, some of the episodes were not that great but overall I think it has a lot going for it. I wonder if one day in several years from now when Disco is over I might end up enjoying it. But honestly after hearing about how there is a school of though that Disco lacks re-watchability I also wonder if maybe I will just forget it exists, like Star Trek Beyond. Which until a couple days ago I forgot about completely. 

If someone would like to recommend some good stand alone episodes of Discovery I could give those a shot. There are great stand alone episodes of every series that I will recommend to people if they don't want to watch decades of tv."
1,"My wife and I watched “Tenet” tonight and over on the r/tenet sticky thread, someone posted the transcript to [this podcast] (https://johnaugust.com/2016/scriptnotes-ep-269-mystery-vs-confusion-transcript) which I thought perfectly captures (one of) the problems with the writing on “Discovery” and “Picard.” 

We’ve talked at length on this sub about how the Abrams school of filmmaking loves mystery boxes but hates ever resolving them. The term “mystery boxes” is really good at summarizing the actual writing device/crutch Abrams et al. love to use, but the phrase itself doesn’t do much to explain, from a tradecraft perspective, why Team Abrams utilizes them so darn ineffectively. 

The podcast gives numerous examples and hypothetical situations of how to deploy mystery to engage the audience well. It explains *why* mystery can be such an engaging narrative tool and when not to use it — and what can occur when mystery is deployed improperly. 

I hope some of the show writers see this, because it seems like they could use it."

1,"Ok hear me out. We recently got a look at the bridge crew of Star Trek: Prodigy. In case you haven't seen it: [https://i.imgur.com/h46CQan.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/h46CQan.jpg)  


Probably the most striking thing about this image is that I didn't have the foggiest idea what species any of these people are. Now every Star Trek has introduced a new race or two in the main cast before but I don't think anybody expected this. I'm interested to see where it goes but the comments to the OP that brought this to my attention recognized 2 species. One is the big rock guy from beta cannon, cool but not important. But what I want to focus on today is 2nd from the left. The general consensus seems to be that that guy is a Talaxian, and I agree.

We know this series takes place sometime during Janeway's lifetime. I know there's a theory floating around that it's the far future and she's a hologram but given the title of this post you can imagine I'm ganna ignore that idea here. There's just not really evidence for it.

From this article: [https://www.startrek.com/news/breaking-star-trek-prodigy-first-look](https://www.startrek.com/news/breaking-star-trek-prodigy-first-look), we also know this group of ""six young outcasts ***know nothing*** about the ship they have ***commandeered***... but over the course of their adventures together, they will each be ***introduced*** to Starfleet and the ideals it represents. Kate Mulgrew was previously announced as reprising the iconic role of Captain Kathryn Janeway to ***lead*** this brand new *Prodigy* bridge crew.""

Now if this series takes place in the alpha/beta quadrant near Federation space how do you NOT know anything about the Federation or Starfleet? Clearly these people are aware of other alien races, and the Talaxians should probably know about Starfleet if this is a post-Voyager show. Especially if they can get to the Alpha/Beta quadrant somehow. And there's the key, we know they can't. Or at least we can be VERY confidant that they can't do that.

Voyager, S7ep25, Endgame. The USS Voyager returns home to Earth in the year 2394 (5 years after ST: Picard). This means at the absolute earliest Starfleet developed the technology to reach the Delta quadrant in 2394 to get Voyager and bring them home. Except, 2404, Janeway goes back in time after 10 years dedicated to trying to get Voyager home early. And what does she do? (Warn Janeway about an attack on Mars/Roulan supernova? Wait no that's a topic for another thread.) Does she just hand young Janeway the schematics to a transwarp drive or whatever advanced propulsion was developed to get home? No because none exists. And that's with old Janeway dedicated with trying to get Voyager home. In the ""real"" timeline I doubt anyone in the Federation is trying to reach the Delta quadrant. The Romulan supernova would have taken up everybody's time and the great journey to the Delta Quadrant isn't mentioned in Picard.

Plus this is Captain Janeway we're talking about. Captain ""I never violated the Prime Directive"" Janeway. If there was any way she could return a commandeered Starfleet vassal to Earth she would do it. Or at least contact the Federation. So why didn't she? Why is she out on this ship alone with 6 kids?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in the mid 24th century a Federation starship goes missing, presumed destroyed. (Bonus points if it's one we know like the one Geordi's mom was on.) In reality it was taken by the caretaker and ended up somewhere in the Delta quadrant, crew dead. Either it is stolen and makes it's way to the Prodigy crew or it never made it all the way to the array and lands near their system. But somehow between the years of 2371 and 2377 it does. Meanwhile Captain Janeway has been in the Delta Quadrant for 1-7 years now and is on a solo mission to the planet McGuffin to secure parts to finally be able to replicate photon torpedoes or something who cares. She will be away from Voyager and out of coms range for some time and will rendezvous with them at a scheduled date weeks in the future.

However everything changes when she finds the unbelievable: another Federation starship, noticeably older the Voyager. She is even more dismayed to find a crew of teenagers form unknown species, save for a Talaxian. Clearly this crew is not from the Federation. She knows she can't have a Federation starship crewed by six random teenagers  in the Delta quadrant. ""The Federation stands for something. It stands for ideals an principles which embrace cooperation and mutual freedom for all life forms. They don't let just anybody serve on these ships."" she tells the crew. And they do not understand. The Delta Quadrant is a harsh and fractured quadrant (much like a lot of the world these days). These kids have no reference for these ideals. Cooperation? Trust? Something more then themselves? What could all that mean? All they've ever known is a life of hardship and having to work hard for everything you need, not be given it.

Janeway knows she can't take the kids with her, and she can't just leave them out here. So she decides to stay with them and take the ship to Voyager or their homeworld or whatever. But the journey will take awhile, and along the way ""they will each be introduced to Starfleet and the ideals it represents."" By the end of the first season the kids learn the value of friendship and cooperation and what it means to be part of something like the Federation. Meanwhile Janeway realizes the Federation isn't about Starfleet or training or even being a Federation citizen. It is about ideals and core values that these kids have come to embrace and live by. She feels confident leaving them with their ship in the knowledge they will represent the Federation just as well as any Starfleet crew she has ever seen. Janeway returns to Voyager, End season 1.

The entire season took place in one of the gaps between Voyager episodes where they reference species and events we never saw.


Edit: Forgot to mention that rencent interview where it was leaked The Outrageous Okona would be in Prodigy. In reality it looks like the actor mispoke and confused Lower Decks and Prodigy. If he didnt that kinda breaks this theory but Im ganna, like many, assume he ment Lower Decks"

I don't like film, or really anything the sequel trilogy stands for but that's a debate for another time. My little amounts of praise for the films include a few small scenes and the characters of Ben Solo &amp; Finn, I do enjoy a few of the duels and this is one of them. It is just a simple duel which I enjoy, I don't feel much emotion when watching it but its entertaining and I like it. The rain makes it feel like a spectacle and there aren't really any complaints with it except them starting to pull lightsabers, which was rather iffy but aside from that, it's a good duel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first duel in Star Wars, though there wasn't really much action in it, it's more the emotion in it which makes it great. Obi Wan confronting his old student and then sacrificing himself in honor of his new hope Luke Skywalker, really a great introduction to lightsaber dueling.

Again I don't like the sequels but that's aside the point. All in all I like this duel because it's one of those simple duels that never becomes boring. Also Kylo &amp; Finn are the only characters from the trilogy that I like and it's an interesting concept seeing a non force sensitive character battle a Sith with a lightsaber with the 2 of them just trying to overpower each other. It's really short this one part of the final duel but still ok.

Dooku vs the 2 Jedi he bested in the end duel of Episode II is a pretty good opening fight for the finale of the Prequels. While the one in Episode II was not good this one improves in everyway, the choreography is on point and there is emotion in it and shows how much Anakin has improved with the lightsaber. And we get to see Anakin getting a big dose of the darkside when he beheads Dooku the man who cut off his arm but like...the best thing to come of this duel is no doubt....*""Dew it"".*

No words besides *""I am your father""* and the duel is great.

A great follow up to the dual from Empire Strikes Back, so much emotion behind it, its fun to watch and it goes along with the Endor battle perfectly. It also conveys Luke starting to struggle with the Dark Side in a very convincing way, but then ends with him swearing his allegiance to the Jedi, great duel.  

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Qui Gon Jinn &amp; Obi Wan Kenobi vs Darth Maul (Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace).**

*Processing img aq52q38obvr61...*

Now I didn't experience this back in '99 because I wasn't born yet but I still love seeing it, this is the first film in the films where we get to see the old Jedi v Sith talked about in the OT going at it (if you dont count the one on tatooine). But it also has an emotional ending and an ambiguous fate for the villain. Also seeing the dual bladed lightsaber is an absolute treat.

This is literally a perfect lightsaber duel for me, fact paced action, force abilities, emotion, its an absolute spectacle, there is no shortage of action, I actually like the fact that its long because that's what we I expect from the most anticipated duel in the entire saga. Some people have deemed this one horrible because of the over the top action with them on the lava but honestly that's the kinda stuff I want in my duels. Honestly I couldn't care if its a bit long because its still really good and never stops being fun to watch.

I kind of like the idea that he doesn't. Not out of kindness but simple logic. The Stormtroopers just follow orders, so the blame for failure would typically be on those who give the orders or fail in their part of his plans, thus why he kills the admirals and those in charge of the troopers."

0,"Hear me out here.  So George Lucas jokingly subtitled his Episode II script ""Jar Jars Great Adventure,"" as a middle finger to his critics, but he still clearly felt the pressure to significantly reduce the character's appearance in comparison to the first film.  

I was re-watching AOTC recently when a thought struck me.  There's a huge gap between the scene when Padme entrusts Jar Jar with her position on the Senate, and the scene later on where Jar Jar proposes to grant Palpatine emergency powers.  There's a brief moment in between where we see Jar Jar being influenced by the passive aggressive comments made by Palpatine and Mas Amedda that call into question his decisiveness.  And that's it.

Let me be clear by saying that Lucas succeeded in utilizing Jar Jar (a prominent character from the first film) to set in motion a key plot point, but because it isn't explored fully it just raises more questions.  Key being: why would Padme appoint someone so incompetent to such a vaulted political position?

So dello felegates, meesa propose this...  

In the scene where Padme appoints Jar Jar her representative on the Senate, they part ways, she walks towards Anakin and he says, 'Jar Jar?  A Senator?"" (Calling into question her judgement - essentially saying what the entire audience is saying.)  And she responds, ""He's great at paperwork,"" or ""you should see him filibuster.""  Anything that would poke fun at the elephant in the room.  We know Jar Jar is inept, BUT turns out he's actually a surprisingly competent politician.  This slight narrative change would be unexpected, changing our perceptions of a character we judged prematurely, AND support Padme's reasoning for choosing him over the countless other politicians in her sphere.  

From there, my second change would be to add Jar Jar's story in the Senate to the remaining portion of the film, cross cutting from Anakin's story, to Kenobi, to Jar Jar.  I really feel that’s something missing in this film.  We see Jar Jar get all this power, and then like an hour later he screws it up.  What the hell happened in between?

One workaround would be to insert a few scenes of Jar Jar in his new position, showing some of the pressure that being a (new) Senetor entails, with the added pressure of being incredibly clumsy. Most of us feel like Jar Jar when we enter a new line of work.  Maybe we have a learning disability, or we’re super awkward in front of new people.  The fact is, most people hired into a new position are pretty awesome at what they do were they not hindered by some of these baked-in personality traits.  What if Jar Jar's story was woven into Ep II, exploring a Gungun trying to overcome his weaknesses and take on a role HE knows he’s capable of, but others think he'll mess up.  It’s a story element that might actually act to enrich the character and redeem him from the one-note comic relief of the first film.  

On top of that, it keeps Jar Jar a relevant and critical part of the overarching prequel narrative, which was George's plan from the start.  Still trying to figure out how he would factor into Episode III so I open the discussion if anyone has any suggestions."
0,"At the moment we have Madalorian and the upcoming 'High Republic' as well as an animated series.

And of course more movies on the way, whatever they may be. So, I'm curious how some of you feel about the future of the franchise, burnt out? excited? pesimistic? etc.

Personally, I've been a fan for years, I'm 25 and was introduced with the prequels, after that I was sucked in and watched and read anything I could've.

The recent trilogy was highly dissapointing to me and to be honest I kind of pretend they don't exist, horrible story between the 3 and so much destruction of logic within the SW universe of which I really enjoyed delving into, especially with the EU.

So, my personal take would be that I'm kind of excited about the future of the franchise but I'll never feel the same about it like I did once, it's become something else and as unfortunate as it is I've come to accept it.

Anyway, am interested in your thoughts!"
0,"So I think we all know the scene I'm refering to towards the end of ROTS, when Anakin force chokes Padme.

Guess what I'm wondering is exactly why did he do that?

Like yeah I get it, he was angry, and yea I understand that he had fallen to the dark side at that point (meaning any anger he feels would come out 10X worse).

But seriously man?

Force choking your pregnant wife, the woman you've done all this awful stuff to save in your mind, just because she argues with you a little?

Seems a bit............extreme to me that he would go that far????

Like did the dark side and the awful things he had done make him an unstable mess or something?

Really not sure how to rationalise this."

I can't help but think that candidates like Bane, Kreia, Sion, Nihilus, Exar Kun, Naga Sadow, Sidious, Durge, &amp; Grievous were to come out victorious over their rivals since they have yet to form a proper and genuine one unlike going up against random people whom they are not acquainted with for no reason.

1,"&gt; You say ""Computer, read me a bedtime story about a Ferengi.""
""The Story of the Self-Mutilated Ferengi,"" the computer begins.
Once upon a time on the planet Ferenginar, a young Ferengi named Gint grew up in a poor family. His father often told him stories of the legendary Ferengi dream: to earn 1,000,000 strips of gold-pressed latinum in one's lifetime. Gint soon grew up, and, inspired by his father's stories, set out to make his own fortune.
Gint began as a peddler, traveling around Ferenginar selling various goods. He was quite successful, and soon he had earned 500,000 strips of gold-pressed latinum. Gint returned home to his family with his 500,000 strips of gold-pressed latinum. His father was so proud of him that he wept.
Unfortunately, Gint had spent all of his hard-earned latinum on various luxurious items and investments, and by the time he returned, he had only 100 strips of gold-pressed latinum left. His father was so angry at him for spending all of his hard-earned money on luxuries that he disowned Gint as his son.
Gint was devastated. He had no choice but to become a beggar on the streets of Ferenginar. He begged Ferengi citizens for spare change, but they all shunned him. After all, he had wasted his chance at becoming a self-made man.
THE END.
""Computer,"" you say, ""is there a moral to this story?""
""Yes,"" the computer says. ""There is. The moral of this story is that you should never try to become a self-made man, because the Ferengi Government will always take advantage of you.""

0,"This has been explained to me before and it was a pretty decent explanation, but I can't remember for the life of me what we talked about or why the Kaminoans didn't take blood samples from the clones to clone from. I think it had something to do with the cloned DNA being lower quality/diluted, so if they kept making clones out of cloned DNA the clones would become steadily worse and more prone to things such as clone madness or deformities as the DNA went down the generations of clones, but I feel like the Kaminoans could've just edited the genetic sequence to solve those problems.

1,"Hi all,

I’ve been recently rewatching some of my favourite Voyager episodes, after binging Stargate for the past year or so for the first time. 
One episode in particular has bothered me for 20 years, Season 4’s ‘Waking Moments’. 
During the course of the episode, we are made aware that Chakotay thought he had woken up after his lucid dream with the alien. However some time later, he wakes up properly and the EMH advises he has been asleep for almost 2 days. Fair enough. 
Later on, Janeway, B’Elanna and Tuvok are becoming aware that they are dreaming and are prowling around the ship. Ok, no problem. 
Chakotay at some stage goes to the bridge to do sensor scans, and sees the moon on the main screen. He starts saying ‘this isn’t real’, and Tom Paris, Janeway and the EMH are present, and say ‘of course it is’, ‘you’re paranoid’ etc. Then they physically restrain him. Then he wakes up again due to the EMH giving him a stimulant.   
My question is where did this Tom Paris, Janeway and EMH come from? The EMH can’t be in the collective dream, as only the live crew members can participate. What this a completely disconnected lucid dream Chakotay was having? As soon as he wakes up, you see dreaming Janeway resuming her walking around Voyager with Tuvok and B’Elanna. So that Janeway was not in the last Chakotay dream, just prior to him waking up and then beaming down to the aliens cave. 
I hope that my question is somewhat clear, yes it maybe some disconnected dream that just Chakotay was having, but why? To me, this part wasn’t explained. It would have been better for the aliens to have intervened and say you’re mistaken that this is a dream. 
Thanks all."

I'm sure when he woke up with the mask on after he literally just got  bested by his master he didn't think oh I'm better than obi-wan now.

I would also be happy if they don't meet, I think either way would work. I'd love it if the show is just obi wan sat around a camp fire having flash backs, something simple, something that shows us content we didn't see or re-vis the clone wars TV show in Live action."

1,"Why do they come up with shows and movies  only to change stuff? Star Trek has plenty of universe to draw from so why can’t these people make a good trek?  New trek doesn’t have the trek spirit.  It’s just a nice looking shell with no substance. Bad writing, bad casting and this obsession with woke politics screws everything up. But they don’t seem to notice people don’t like it.  

They keep trying to appeal to a new audience.  Who ever is behind that should be fired!  The old audience was fine and willing to pay big money for good trek.  As far as I know the same people who would like trek are still being born today (People who like science and technology and dream about the future ect).  So the audience lives but they don’t want to cater to us. That’s stupid. 

If they just would do what the fans want, they would make big money.  Man I wish I had the capital to make real trek. It’s not hard to come up with a good plot using the established universe. I would get the most dedicated fans to help make sure things were canon and fit. 

STD is pure trash and I can barely stand to watch it.  It looks like someone who watched one episode of trek and said they can make a show. Then Picard 🤦‍♂️.  Everyone treated him like trash. He still had the syndrome even though he knew about it for decades. Then you kill him im off and make seven randomly gay. Then you had this weird incest thing happening with the romulans.  They had perfect opportunity to swap out Brent for another actor to play Data if he didn’t want to. But nope he dead too. It tried but that wasn’t trek either. Bad graphics with copy and paste  with Rikers ships. The main hero ship looks ugly and is a silly name. Universe is Too dark and federation sucks. Where is the hope?  This ain’t the way (Mandalorian reference lol)

The point of all this is I wish they would do what we want Instead of changing things cause they think it’s cool. It didn’t need to change much. Just add some good Villians and battles to what was already there. But the spirit of trek must be there. Fan films suck but the spirit is alive. If we could find someone who understands, it would be awesome. End rant..."

0,"The Death Star Costed 1 Quintillion credits, It could destory planets in a single shot at barely full power.

But a B1 BD costs only 1,800 credits. The Death Star was easily destroyed, and so was the Second Death Star.

But the Clone Wars lasted a few Years with at least several Million Battle Droids. 

If we divide 1 Quintillion by 1,800, We get 5.5555556e+14 B1 Battle Droids (I used a Calculator for obvious reasons) that could have been manufactured, Even if Droids can't get programming that is more effective than organics, A Supermassive army of droids can conquer territory very quickly with cannonfoughter tactics and massive attacks. But I rest my case, Rebels and the New Republic could bomb the hell out of Bases with B1 battle droids and the Empire would loose Millions instantly if Factories are destroyed.

What do you think?"
1,"A few days ago, I started watched TOS for the first time. My exposure to Star Trek before was limited to the J. J. Abrams movies, which I think are good movies if taken on their own, but from what I gather they're not really true to what Star Trek is about.

I've decided to go with airdate order (I've been told it doesn't matter because the episodes are all standalone, and Netflix uses airdate order so it's easy) and I skipped ""The Cage"" (at least for now) because it was an unaired pilot that had a different Enterprise crew. I've just finished watching the eighth aired episode, ""Miri"". 

So far, I really like this show. I generally struggle with older TV (and by ""older"", I mean pre-Twin Peaks), but TOS is proving to be an exception to that. Even if the episodes are standalone (which is fine, I just prefer serialized shows, or at least partly-serialized ones like Buffy or The X-Files), I love how TOS uses science fiction stories to explore the human condition -- and that sort of psychologically-driven storytelling is what I look for in any TV show I watch. 

I also absolutely love the cast (especially William Shatner, who I always assumed was a hammy actor, but he's really impressing me so far) and I'm really digging the 60s aesthetic of it. Even though the show is set in the future, it's very much a product of the late 60s and I've always been attracted to the style and fashion of that era. And sure, the flipside of that is that it can be dated at times, but for the most part I think it holds up really well and it's remarkably progressive for something from that era.

I think the best example is Captain Kirk himself. The Abrams movies gave the impression that Kirk was a womanizing prick, a depiction of 60s masculinity that might seem problematic these days (like Connery's Bond). But he's really not, Kirk is an outstanding captain who has as much respect for his crew as they have for him. He's an uplifting, inspirational character to watch, and also a total badass, but not in a way that makes him seem like an asshole. The revisionist depiction of Kirk is in my opinion the biggest fault of Abrams' movies. I just really love Kirk, he's easily my favourite character so far, and Shatner does a great job in the role. 

My only real criticism so far is that the supporting characters (Uhura, Sulu, Yeoman Rand, etc...) don't really have that much focus or development. It's nice to have them there and they've all had a few moments to shine, but they don't really seem to do that much. The show is focused on Kirk, Spock, and McCoy -- who are interesting characters, make no mistake, but I guess I'd like a more ensemble cast. That's probably my only criticism of the show though, and it's a minor one at that. 

Anyway, here's my thoughts on the eight episodes I've watched so far:

* **""The Man Trap""** \-- a decent first episode. Obviously not a real pilot, but nonetheless it was a good introduction to the series. The lighthearted animosity between Spock and McCoy was well-established and the salt monster was entertaining enough, although derivative of 50s monster movies. I liked the ethical issues posed by a dying and lonely member of a near-extinct species just trying to survive by any means necessary. It's an interesting question, and it helps elevate what otherwise would be a disposable monster story. 
* **""Charlie X""** \-- the 60s are strong with this one. I don't know if it's the bright colors, the uniforms, Charlie's whole demeanor, or Uhura singing (fantastic, by the way), but this felt very much a product of the 60s, which in my book is a good thing. There's some interesting questions about the confusion of adolescence and how it's akin to being a child in an adult's body, and Charlie acting inappropriately with Yeoman Rand was handled pretty well for the 60s. But Charlie himself is a weak link, he's not a very interesting character and he drags the whole episode down.   
* **""Where No Man Has Gone Before""** \-- the first truly great episode. The title  emphasizes the vastness of space and how anything beyond our imagination can be out there. There's a cosmic horror to this one, and the idea that a fallible human mind (i.e. one that still craves self-preservation above all else) would become a monster if granted an indestructible body is both a terrifying and fascinating concept. And Shatner knocks it out of the park, especially when trying to convince Dehner that Mitchell cannot be trusted with his new powers. 
* **""The Naked Time""** \-- a virus spreading through the ship has an uncanny relevance now. The virus acting like intoxication is weird and leads to some goofy moments, but there's interesting stuff here. The crewman becoming disillusioned with the Enterprise's mission is solid because it reflects how in real-life exploratory missions were little more than plunderers. By removing the crew's conscience, we see that there's a darker side to the human desire to explore and discover, and that further highlights the nobility of the Enterprise's mission. 
* **""The Enemy Within""** \-- probably my favorite episode so far. It felt like the synthesis of the ideas that series has being dealing with up to now -- especially that everyone has a dark side, and that being a good person is not about purging that darkness but rather tempering it with more positive attributes. The idea of literally splitting up Kirk's light and dark sides and demonstrating how neither of them can survive on their own is absolute genius. This is a great script, and Shatner takes full advantage of his chance to shine here. 
* **""Mudd's Women""** \-- on the flipside, this is probably the weakest of the episodes I've watched so far. Harry Mudd was entertaining enough, an intergalactic pimp who's somehow both sleazy and hilariously bumbling, but the story was incredibly stupid and seemed to be based in some incredibly regressive ideas about gender roles. And yeah, this show is from the 60s and a certain degree of dated ideas can be tolerated, but TOS has been above this sort of thing so far. The script is just lazy and the ending is bafflingly dumb. This one's pretty shit, to be honest. 
* **""What Are Little Girls Made Of?""** \-- oh man, I loved this episode until the final 15 minutes. The idea that being human, even with all the flaws that entails, is better than being a machine is one of my favorite concepts in science fiction. And once again, like with ""The Enemy Within"", we get a Kirk doppelganger to highlight what it is that makes Kirk the leader he is. This episode does such a good job these ideas until the ending, which drops all the interesting ideas and just focuses on delivering a ""shocking"" twist. It's such a disappointing waste of potential. 
* **""Miri""** \-- a solid episode, not up there with my favourites so far but still entertaining and thought-provoking. I love the idea that the consequence of experimenting with eternal life is that a group of children are unable to grow into adults -- i.e. not coming to terms with ageing means that you can never mature. But what was with the planet being an exact doppelganger of Earth? I suppose the point was to illustrate that the civilization was identical to ours, but the fact that Earth has a twin deep in space is a bizarre thing to leave unexplained. 

So yeah, I'm quickly becoming obsessed with this show. TOS is dated, sure, but I don't think it's *outdated*, if you know what I mean. While it's obviously a product of its time (for better and for worse), there's also a timelessness about it and I certainly think that the ethical and moral issues that it raises remain relevant questions for our society to ask. And that, I gather, is the whole point of Star Trek."
1,"The Complete Robot by Isaac Asimov is a collection of his robot stories.  Distinctive is that his robots are always benevolent and never break the 3 laws. Asimove did hate the Frankenstein monster troop about robots.

What was the motive to include The Complete Robot, its not a random prop book, but a active choice. Is it to insult Asimov? Lack of real SF-knowledge, Asimov did write about robots lets put it in, becsue we to write robot stories. Do you have any idea what they was thinking?"

0,"“Crystal Crisis on Utapau” is a 4-episode arc of unfinished story reels from “Star Wars: The Clone Wars”

The only place to view this arc is if you have the Blu-Ray release of Season 6 of “The Clone Wars”.

People have reuploaded them on YouTube, but they get taken down by Disney. LucasFilm has even removed the episodes off of StarWars.Com

Why haven’t Disney and LucasFilm added this 4-episode arc on the EXTRAS tab on “The Clone Wars” on Disney+? This would make this story easily accessible, plus this story is completely CANON.

Better yet, what if LucasFilm Animation fully animates this arc and makes it an exclusive Disney+ special movie? That be a great way to keep subscriptions and pad out the Star Wars library with more content!

The story reels were in the same state as the “Bad Batch arc” before they got finished! Please Disney, LucasFilm, and Dave Filoni! Save the “Crystal Crisis arc” from being forgotten and lost to time, make it widely accessible so others may view it again or for the first time!"

0,"I personally love this movie. From the beginning to the end. I admit that the first time I saw it, it was just a low-quality Star Wars, but after each time I saw it, I fell in love with it more and more and I found a reason for it.

The film is full of great sequences and elements, beautiful decisions, amazing tributes, but the film itself has a big flaw in connecting these good points together. Mostly due to excessive speed and poor film editing. (it's amazing how someone who edited TFA with one of the bests edits ever, edited this too. that makes me think about something like The JJ cut.)

After reading the TRoS novel, it became the best Star Wars for me. And why? Because now I could make good connections between those elements. Now the logic of the film was not empty for me, now the emotional burden of the sequences was induced in me, now the short and aimless action of the film had become meaningful and beautiful for me.

I am interested in the Star Wars novel and I always read several at the same time. And I really recommend reading the novelization of this movie to all of you. It made me really fall in love with the movie itself.

I know that not all Star Wars fans read novels, but even without the novel, over time they fill in the blanks with their minds and understand the meanings of the film.

That's why I think the next 5 years will be like this movie even without reading the novel. I very much hope that the story after TRoS will be told as soon as possible.

I have loved TFA for a long time and I always knew it as one of the best SW ever. I really enjoyed TLJ and although I admit that it is an amazing movie, I am dissatisfied with some of its decisions and it was a little bit boring for me, but I still like it. And now, after seeing TRoS 18 times and reading the novel, I consider it the best sequel movie and my favorite SW of all.

It's absolutely right that many people do not like the film or call it weak, but I liked it and I hope they are happy that I can enjoy it and every time I see it, I get more meanings and points from it.

I would love to see your thoughts on this. peace guys. :)"

I have loved *Solo* since the first time I saw it. It's fun, it's fast-paced, it basically checks of all the boxes I wanted a Han Solo movie to check off - meeting Chewbacca, meeting Lando, winning the Millennium Falcon in a Sabacc game (which, by the way, I loved the little twist of the winning game not happening right away), making the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs (well, if you round down, anyway) - it introduced some great new characters, it featured a cameo from a beloved old villain, it showed that not every Star Wars movie needs to feature a crisis of galactic proportions involving some combination of space wizards, gargantuan battle stations, and enormous armies... I could go on and on, but I think you get my point.

If anything, I think that the one flaw with the movie was not anything about the movie itself, but rather its release date. Having it come out so soon after TLJ and its polarized reaction (to put it generously) really hurt it, especially given all the drama involving the movie's directors. If *Solo*'s release date had been delayed to Christmas 2018, there would have been more time for Ron Howard to polish the movie, and it could have been given a proper marketing push instead of the rushed job it ended up receiving. Having a new Star Wars movie every Christmas was really fun while it lasted, and I think we'd still be getting that (well, the current state of movie theaters notwithstanding) had *Solo* been given a bit more breathing room. Instead, it really felt like Lucasfilm hit the brakes really hard with their plans for Star Wars movies after *Solo* basically tanked at the box office."

1,"I wish I could take you all back in time with me... to what it was like to watch TNG's 'Q Who' first-run.

Some people like new Star Trek, some don't like it. Most fans watch it regardless. The more things change, the more they stay the same. It was much the same as the Second Renaissance played its course after TNG went off the air, as fans split in online response to DS9 and Voyager. It's fine; it's all fine. This is the Third Renaissance. I enjoy it all on a meta-fan level now, after years and years, regardless of some of the details and specifics.

Yay! Star Trek again!

Now, step back, if you will... to 1989.

When TNG was new, it was on uncertain footing. Syndicated first-run television was a new experiment, a successful one that would later give fruit to a whole host of television hits of the 90's including Hercules and Xena and the like as well and Deep Space Nine and Voyager. Original Star Trek had enjoyed such a successful run in syndication during the First Renaissance partly due to the expansion of local televisions stations into the then-new syndicated rerun market, but also because it was entirely produced, and thus costless, to Paramount. A successful movie series (with modest movie budgets for science fiction) had been launched, but it had yet to be proven if a more expensive first-run independent science fiction television series could WIN OUT... with fans of the existing syndicated reruns they had watched for years, and in a financial sense balancing the revenue from the local stations buying the show against its cost of production.

The Ferenghi had bombed out as an effective villain, stooping and scheming and snapping their improbable laser-whips; it couldn't be denied. Q had lost some of his edge in his attempt to recruit Riker into the continuum in his previous appearance as well: begging for permission from the Continuum to do more Q things after Picard tricked him out of the agreement, leaving him stammering like a Kirk-Era AI stuck on a paradox. So, when a second season (tight uniforms!) TNG episode quietly crept onto the screen with an unusually subdued soundtrack, there was little indication of the wild ride a cold, alien, and independently-omnipotent Q would give us.

I won't belabor the point further. Watch the episode again, of course. It goes down real well all by itself, even separate from a full watch-through. I do it every now and then.

With the teasers from the Picard Season 2 trailer, I'm looking forward to seeing that old Q again: the Q that went away for a while until 'All Good Things,' and then settled down into a comfy Voyager family cruise, probably taking care of John de Lancie's mortgage; more power to him.

We saw the Borg again in New Trek, 3rd Renn Trek, I guess. They were almost really scary there for a minute, weren't they? But they wound up mostly a tease. Then again, I did like the implication that the plot didn't dare fully unleash then: at that point they become the main threat if they are true to their nature. And with Seven front-and-center, the Queen concept was key to how they were depicted. You know, people online bagged on how they were used in 2nd Renn Trek too: the feeling was they were a bit overplayed in the last four or five seasons of Voyager. Like TNG's 'Best of Both World,' Voyager's 'Scorpion' wound up a third season peak featuring the Borg reaching heights the series wouldn't hit again, IMO. Other Borg episodes were... fine.

We just had First Contact Day which is a fine idea if--like Paramount+ itself--a little late and not yet dripping with originality beside the featured content itself. Anyway, some people bagged on 'Star Trek: First Contact' at the time of its release for introducing the Queen concept in the first place.

There are fair points to be made for how the Borg concept was diluted and made less threatening. But, really, only 'Q Who' shows the purest, most undiluted form of the Borg; an unstoppable hive-mind concept originally designed to be an insectoid species by (shortly thereafter controversially departed) produce Maurice Hurley, and wisely modified to reflect the fears we naturally have of technology, the loss of our individuality among the mob's consensus, and ""the Singularity."" As much as fans love 'Best of Both Worlds,' and as much as that epic two-parter deserves that love for being amazing epic television that basically took all the uncertainty heading into the 3rd season of TNG and turned it into the Second Renaissance, it was the first dilution of the Borg concept. 

In 'Best of Both Worlds,' the Borg wanted Picard, specifically. When they captured and assimilated him, they improbably gave him a name, ""Locutus."" They put him front and center in all communications. This is a smart thing for the television writers and producers to do, to put the prowess of Patrick Stewart on screen and play the reversal and betrayal. It's great character work and great television that helped launch an era.

But maybe some part of me still hopes the Borg are refreshed again some day, back to the finest, purest original concept evoked in the post title quote. Perhaps after all these defeats due to having an assimilated representative, or even a Queen, they might decide to modify their network to be more like the real distributed internet and less like the South Park Giant Central Router internet. As cybernetic organisms, it's not unlikely they could merely install and upgrade and modify their routines: no negotiation... no regard of individuality at all... you're just RAW MATERIAL to them... resistance indeed futile.

But, if not, that's fine with me too. Yay! Star Trek again!"

The first order was made from the ashes of the empire. And after episode 6 the empire was never destroyed. Sure the second Death Star was destroyed and their Star destroyers were gone but outside of the the battle of jakku and some skirmishes the empire just disappeared. Because it was being reformed into the empire by snoke. And kylo believed that Vader’s biggest mistake was falling to the light. And he wants to finish what Vader started, bringing order to the galaxy with the first order. I think the same goes for starkiller base. for one it’s built on Ilum where kyber crystals were mined to power the Death Star, so just building the new station on the planet is different than the Death Star. And tfa even says,”it’s another Death Star.” But I think it makes sense that the first order would continue the empires goal."

I've never seen any of the films so last night I asked him to pick one at random for us to watch and it ended up being Insurrection.

But if you hate TLJ bc it kills Luke’s character from the OT... then I ask.

Do the prequels kill Yoda’s character from the OT? Because watch Empire and ROTJ and tell me after hearing Yoda in those films that he was a war general killing machine in the prequels. He goes from: “For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.” to being an all out war general. I’m going to go ahead and guess that “it doesn’t matter” because the war mainly consists of clones and droids. But I would argue that based off of the OT, Yoda would never be involved in war in the first place.

Yes, Yoda acknowledges he failed greatly during that time. So maybe that explains it. But why can’t Luke fail? Why can’t he have a period of time where he makes drastic mistakes?

It seems like double standard to me just because people love Luke more, maybe I’m wrong. I would love for someone to give me a compelling reason why they feel otherwise. Lets keep it respectful."
1,"I know there is unofficial canon as to how the eugenics wars timeline fits without our own timeline, but I think Discovery could be the one show that attempts to fill in this plot hole. 

Discovery in season 3 is after the temporal cold war, but the events of the temporal cold war are blurry at best. If there were any types or humans that would cause havoc in the humans ranks during a temporal cold war it could be Napoleon-esc genetically modified beings like we saw in Khan, or part of section 31. Two things that Bashir has ties to from Ds9.

Bashir would be perfect as that vessel to tell the story of the people who would have fought those who would try to effect the timeline. Many episodes involve Bashir talking about the importance of protecting the timeline, and had content with section 31 and the time agents. Along with his high security clearance in star fleet it all makes him a possible choice.

There are multiple ways Bashir could be a part of this distant future as well. Being a time traveler stuck in the future is doable, but that is already the Discovery's plot arc. More interesting to me is that Bashir met with Dr. Zimmerman, and was scanned as a possible Emergency Medical Hologram replacement model. As holographs were being advocated for rights like other sentient beings in the post Voyager canon, a Julien Bashir hologram seems plausible to me."
1,"I very liked Deep Space Nine, one of the best Star Trek show ever, but always feeled that the end was rushed. I liked that the show unfolds many species and galactic powers we just seen for the duration of an episode. The Cardassians, Bajor’s occupation, the Ferengi and so on, we get to know more and more about them.

One of my favorites were the Ferengi, the always latinum crawing con artists, the merchant who become clever to scam their customer and the businessmen who evermore wants to profit from everything. You understood what motivates and drives them, basically in the surface its greed and making more money. In the Ferengi civilization the most meaningful goal in life is earning profit, in their culture you worth as much as you have. We see their believes and concepts about this philosophy like the Great Material Continuum, buying your place in the afterlife, their strict law to always pursue profit with every business and the famous Rules of Acquisition.

The ferengi characters in the show are very interesting and captivating. Quark as he tries to run a profitable business and be a ferengi role model, but in the same time have a dilemma to listening to his consciousness and feeling remorse. Nog as he growing up and choose to left behind the ferengi pursue for profit lifestyle for meaningful happiness and live a worthwhile life but still valuing his culture. And Rom who is a little slow, lack self-confidence and dont have any talent earning latinum is basically a ferengi failure, but a brilliant engineer and can fix almost anything.

There was some very good episodes focusing on the ferengi culture and the characters is tangled shenanigans for money or pursuing others things. I liked the episodes with Brunt and Quark encounters with the FCA, the Grant Nagus Zek and that everyone tries to be his successor and many more things. Or those episodes like when Pel a female ferengi disguise herself as a male to earn profit or Quark mom Ishka illegally makes profit was very entertaining.

I exceptionally loved the episode Profit and Lace where the Grant Nagus Zek and his lover Ishka goes to DS9 because they needed to flee from Ferenginar. Zek just made a new law allowing females to wear clothes, but this decision brought with it several problems from the ferengi males point of view. If females can wear clothes they can go outside, if they can go outside they can work and if they can work they can earn profit. But in the episode they explain it with using logic and reason why its a good thing for the ferengi economy, not just stating that by the human standards its unethical. Presenting the situaton from the ferengi point of view, that if females can work they will earn profit and also will spend money too. Many employer gets a lot of new employee they can get to use to earn more profit and a lot of merchants can sell a lot of female product with high value. As Ishka is said the females are more than 50% of the population of the planet and finally they can start to pull their own weight. Females can work and earn profit, employers gets a new working force and merchants a lot of new customers. Literally everyone wins!

My problem is in with the last few episodes! There was a few very progressive movements and recently significant social reforms in the ferengi homeworld. Welfare programs, starting fundings and charity for poors, whats totally alien from the ferengi people and culture. Surely Quark dont like this, but even the Grant Nagus is position is weakened to reverse these things. So the ferengi rapidly changing big time, maybe changing a little too fast. There was no logical explanation for these changes in the ferengi values, aside from the writers clear message to the audience about progressing our real world society. But what is a good message about ourselves completely makes no sense in the point of view about the ferengi people, culture and economy.

They dont even try to explaine this rapid shift with some logic, like how these progressions help the ferengi to do what they do the best, earn more profit. Maybe something like making a new Rule of Acquisition: „You can scam someone just only once, but you can earn profit from someone for a lifetime.” Making a clear message that ripped-off costumers will not come back, but with fair trade you can earn so much more money. Yes, the ferengi basically a loose caricature of the 21 century people who are overly obsessed with money and owning things. Nothing wrong with this or sending a few ethical message to the viewer, but changing their entire defining trait through 1 or 2 episode without clear explanation is a really big problem. Just show me why the ferengi people and society wants or needs these radical changes, and its driven by reasons not just human moral and ethical values.

My last problem that Zek choose Rom as his successor as the new Grant Nagus and the leader of all ferengi! Dont get me wrong I like Rom is character! Despite his dumb characterisation maybe he could be a fair and respected leader, just not a good one for ferengi! Honestly he dont showed any competent leadership or business capabilities, maximum making his not so successful strike in Quark is bar the only thing I can think of. I think it could have been a good episode on its own, Ishka manipulate Zek to choose his son Rom as the next Nagus but Quark for obvious reasons disagree and wants to prove he is the right choice. They start bickering about it and earn Zek is good side, but then Pel returns to also become the Nagus. But she shows up with a little fleet of goods from the gamma quadrant where she made a very big fortune with business. In the end of the episode Ishka convince Zek to choose Pel, dont because she is a female but because she proven to be more suitable to the role of the Nagus.

I think with making them more closer to the human standards the ferengi will lose their indentity. Just like Tuvok said in the episode Flashback humans thinks they are the center of the universe and everyone needs to be more like them. Or remind me about Eddington is comparison the federation and its influence on other cultures to the borg assimilation. But what do you think? You also see as the series end was rushed? The ferengi deserve another leader than Rom? Or you satisfied with everything?"

1," 📷[**Richard Marks**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Richard-Marks-11), a long time sci-fi fan who reads far too many books and watches far too much tv[Answered July 30, 2016](https://www.quora.com/Are-fuses-lost-technology-in-Star-Trek-Why-do-consoles-explode/answer/Richard-Marks-11)

The basic answer is that consoles explode because it makes it look like exciting and dangerous things are happening on the ship. But that explanation is boring, so lets look at why a console would shower people with sparks and blow up.

Strange as it may seem, it is possible to make a console/object explode even with a working fuse. The reason why is because of the way a fuse works.

\*A picture of a fuse\*

This is a fuse, just like you would find in any piece of electrical equipment. The way a fuse works is that in a normal state of operation, and under the fuses rated amperage, nothing happens. But when there is a power surge, the amperage going through the fuse shoots up like crazy heating up that filament and causing it to break.

[Fuse (electrical)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical))

Now the time it takes for a fuse to reach that breaking point is determined by different factors, but the important thing to realize is that it may not happen instantly. Additionally, the break caused by the overheating may not be all that large, which is also important.

What happens when a ship is hit is that vast energies are sent like shockwaves through the electrical system. Those energies may be from the phaser directly hitting the ship, or (more likely in my opinion) from the vast energies the ship has to use to create the shielding used to protect the ship from the energy blast. The sudden cessation of which would cause a generator to over power. Where ever it comes from that energy has to go somewhere, and it will spread through the electrical systems blowing fuses along the way.

Now remember that a fuse is nothing more than a piece of metal designed to melt when a certain amperage limit is reached. This melting happens very quickly, but is not instant. Also due to the high energy levels, it is also possible for the electricity to jump the small gap that is created. And once past the fuse, it will invariably start to impact the next object on the circuit in a negative manner. This can cause the panels on the starship to explode.

This is also why it is recommended that you turn off electrical equipment like TV’s and PC’s during a lightning storm, it is possible for a lightning strike to get past all of the circuit breakers and fuses in your house and destroy such electrical equipment."
1,"Well it is quite confusing for me, I don't know, I might be wrong. Though Vulcan is a desert planet with scarce food and water supplies. There evolution has made them strong to withstand this and be able to go days without eating or drinking. Though it is also said they have a faster metabolism than humans and expel toxins from their bodies faster. That already bumps together but that may be due to some sort of thing their bodies have to separate the toxins from food and water. My question is actually  why do they consume so much. I have seen T'Pol consumes human amounts of food muiltiple times a day with Archer. It makes sense if she does it to follow our custom at eating at certain times but she eats our amount of food. T'pol is really skinny though where would she put the big amounts of food she consumes. She does not need that much food yet she eats a lot.

1,"This is my first post on this sub and I'll be talking about what says in the title. I know that y'all probably don't care about this, but I got nothing else to do, so I'm going to share it anyways, K? 😊

I was born in 2001 (so I'm currently 19) and I never watched Star Trek when I was a kid because I always assumed it was a ""nerdy"" rip-off of Star Wars or something, which is a very cringe statement in retrospect. I sort of ""discovered"" the franchise in 2016 (when I was 15) by accident during a Google search for a school assignment. The movie that I stumbled upon was JJ Abrams' Star Trek (2009).

I was bored so I decided to watch it and I loved it! I then watched Into Darkness. And then Beyond in cinemas! I'm lucky I discovered this trilogy soon enough to be able to watch its last entry in cinemas. I feel sad that I wasn't able to watch the previous two movies in cinemas. Anyways, after all of that, this trilogy became my ""special interest."" This means that I would spend a lot of time thinking about it and making cringy art and fanfics, binging any video and podcast remotely related to them, and constantly talking about it with my friends at school.

When I started listening to podcasts about these specific movies, I accidentally absorbed and learned a lot of information about the rest of the franchise as well, leading me to get out of my comfort zone and watch more Trek outside of the Kelvin timeline. I watched Wrath of Khan to compare it to Into Darkness. Needless to say that it was a lot better and now it's my second favorite of the movies. Beyond is still my number one favorite. But I might be a little biased because it is the only Trek movie I watched in cinemas. I didn't watch The Motion Picture first because I kept hearing it was boring. I eventually watched it and while it wasn't my favorite, I still liked it just fine. Then I watched the rest of the movies prior to 2009, followed by the Star Trek Discovery and Lower Decks TV shows.

I've recently started to check out each one of the older TV shows before Discovery and Lower Decks. I've watched around 10 episodes of each of the shows just to try, and I honestly don't see myself finishing these shows, not because I don't like them, but because I usually never finish TV shows. Especially those that are TOO long for me. I think that my ADHD might have something to do with that, but we'll see...

Star Trek is now one of my favorite series right now. I love the characters, the starships, the stories, and the different iterations of it. And while it is true that I have outgrown JJ Abrams' Star Trek trilogy when I started to watch more objectively better iterations, I still hold this movie trilogy with a lot of fondness in my heart because I wouldn't be the Star Trek fan that I'm now without 'em.

I know that these movies are HEAVILY despised by a lot of Trekkies, and I now understand why. However, I firmly believe that these movies are a great entry point for people who are new to the franchise. They are accessible, fun to watch, and introduce you to the basic elements of Star Trek.

Welp. There it is. I hope that in the future I can get more involved in this community. Love y'all! ❤️"
1,"I haven't seen every episode of every series, but I've seen all of TOS, all the movies, lots of TNG and a decent amount of DS9.

Seems like no one is ever watching TV or a movie. Plenty of reading, socializing, holodecking, etc. But you never see anyone watching TV."
0,"Just kinda confuses me, a lot could have been prevented, same with obi and yoda, where were they for Luke and Or Kylo. 

And Ik yoda was there for Luke when he burnt down the tree, but like before that? When Luke wanted to kill his nephew? You don’t think Anakin, Obi, or Yoda should have stepped in and said something?"
1,"So, I was pretty excited about it, and there some very good and interesting bits.

I really enjoyed Aaron Eisenberg’s scenes. He was absolutely incredible. It felt like I could have watched 5 hours of interviews with him.

I enjoyed learning various things such as the relationship between the actors Avery Brooks and Cirroc Lofton, who played Ben and Jake Sisko. Avery took Cirroc to his first Lakers game and introduced him to friends as one of his children. I also found it interesting that Michael Piller, a senior writer, introduced a process for screen play submissions for episodes, which helped to jump start a few writer’s careers.

I enjoyed seeing the remastered visuals for the space battle they shot.

However, there were a number of issues that I had with it.

It was way too pompous and self-serving. It felt like it was done so Ira could pat himself on the back, and circlejerk with others. I understand that it was Ira’s project, but it was way over the top.

They talked about why Terry Farrell left, and it was awful. It was mentioned that “some producer said if it weren’t for DS9 she would  be working at K-MART.” and quickly covered it up. Terry cried as she was talking about it, and it was difficult to watch especially to see how they covered for the producer. Rick Berman and his chamber-pot boys were the ones that harassed her about working at K-MART. She was also sexually harassed by Rick Berman. It was jarring.

The self-serving nature of the documentary also repeatedly touched on how progressive and feminist various aspects of the show were, which fell flat with the blatantly awkward coverup they did with Terry.

The documentary also only briefly mentioned Babylon 5 in some angry fan mail that Aaron Eisenberg read. It’s safe to say that the serialized nature of DS9 as well as the shows religious and numerous other elements stem from the Babylon 5 Bible that Straczynski used in his pitch to Paramount."
1,"I mean, the movie with clone-Romulan Picard outright took away all pretext and made it blatantly sexual. 

There was another with the psychic historians, another where Troi and her mother were abducted and forced to be naked... I mean, I'm not crazy, right?"

Has he always used the colour scheme that we know today? Or did he go through some other variations in his earlier years? Similar to Jango in the Open Seasons comics"
1,"That was a warship.  The andromeda (from the show andromeda) was powerful enough to go up against hundreds of ships.  It had an insane amount of fire power.  It makes the scimitar look lightly armed.  It was two or three times the size of a galaxy class ship but more then ten, fifteen, maybe even twenty times more powerful.  It also had nova weapons and planet destroying weapons and other unconventional weapons.  But usually it's conventional weapons were more then enough.  The andromeda could level a planet's surface in two minutes.  If the federation built ships like that it's enemies would think twice about going to war with them.

Even the borg would be foolish to engage a ship like that.  The federation has built smaller warships.  But imagine what they could accomplish if they built a ship designed for war that was two or three times the size of a galaxy class ship that had all the weapons they could put on it.  If a ship like that had gotten lost in the delta quadrant it would have a pretty easy trip home.  Because very few hostile aliens would have the balls to mess with it.  So should the federation build warships like the andromeda.  Let me know what you think in the comments."
1,"I was ten watching ""All Good Things"" in 94 when TNG concluded. It was really only in my teens did I realize that P.S. and subsequently the character of J.L.P. was considerably younger than my young mind had thought. I honestly thought Captain Picard was in his 60s, with a nearly 30 year age difference between him and Commander Riker. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you watched TNG as a kid, how old did you think Captain Picard was?"
1,"Star Trek Insurrection should’ve been about the Dominion Invasion/liberation of Betazed. Make Troi a prominent role and with Picards and Odo’s relationship with her mother, have Odo, O’Brien, and Worf be temporary assigned to the Enterprise for the liberation of Betazed. This would have also have the opportunity to have a ""Hard PG-13"" movie showing the Dominion war."
0,"Hello 

I bought the Deagostini Millennium Falcon and I'm building it at the moment. 

 The associated booklet speaks of a website that contains reference images of the studio model. 

 Unfortunately I cannot open the page.  

Has anyone of you downloaded the pictures and can they make them available to me?  Maybe via Dropbox?  


Thank you in advance Philipp"
0,Do you think with Dooku now needing to get off the ship they were on in Revenge of The Sith do you think they would have been successful in bringing him to Coruscant? If they do succeed in bringing Dooku to Coruscant how much would the story change?
0,"EDIT: Ok i was just reminded about Plagueis so for the purposes of the discussion he's gone to. No more Sith trickery!

So a thought experiment I came up with. Let's remove Palpatine from the Star Wars universe. He doesn't exist. Now how does that change things in terms of galactic politics?

I think things still occur in a similar fashion. The issues that were plaguing the Republic (Senate corruption, wealth gap between Core and Outer Rim) were not issues Palpatine created, he just took advantage of them for his own goals. But the rot was already there in the Republic. I know it's no longer canon but the book ""Tarkin"" does a good job of showing the political scene leading up to the Clone Wars. I think a civil war would happen though with different leadership on the succeeding planets end. It would probably be more a grassroots led effort without as much corporate backing. I guess that would depend on the leader of course. Is there someone as charismatic as Dokku as the face? For that end does Dokku still fall even without Palpatine around? 

I think a war still occurs and there are three key things to keep in mind.

1. This time the Jedi are aware.

Without Palpatine using the dark side to blind the Jedi they have a better  grasp of things and are able to make better decisions. Perhaps they can still prevent a war. However if not then we go to number 2.

2. This time no surprise army for the Republic ie the Clones

Without Palpatine manipulating events does Sifo-Dyas have the foresight of galactic war that leads to the clone army? It's possible but it's also possible he does not. So where does that lead things if a war starts. No clones so the Republic has to form its own army from scratch either through enrollment or conscription. On the other side with no Dokku and Palpatine working the corporations like the Techno-Union there is no droid army. If the leader of the oppositon in this alternate timeline is a grass roots man of the people type then they wouldn't take corporate help, most likely.

3. The war can be bloodier and more in the Core's backyard.

I will confess I am only on season 2 of Clone Wars so maybe there are more attacks later on. But it seems like most of the action is taking place in the Outer Rim Sieges. Coruscant is isolated, the clones do the killing and dying, not the people. So the war isn't something they need to worry about, aside from an occasional Zillo Beast. This is because we have Palpatine working things from both ends to serve his own needs.

In an alternate timeline with a different enemy and leader that may not be the case. A alternative opposition group might be more willing to engage in terrorist actions or even direct attacks on Core worlds, maybe even Coruscant itself.

Anyway, just a few ideas I had of how I timeline with no Palpy might play out. I'm curious as to what others think."

He loves Clone Wars and his fav character is Asoka, and looking for a spot to get posters.  I have been to all the classic spots, but wondering if anyone has any secret spots to pick some up or recommendations.  Thanks in advance.  

P.S. I am in Canada and would rather order from Canada, but if I found something I loved I'd order from US."
1,Is it just me or my Netflix or is the color grading for this episode absolutely abysmal? Everything looks so washed out :/
1,"A long time ago I read a Voyager novel that I am now trying to find again.  Janeway gets separated from Voyager and ends up on an alien ship as a bottom-rung crew member.  The ship (and others in the story) used ""tile"" technology to power their warp jumps; they would need to loiter near a star until the tiles absorbed enough power to enable a single jump, each one risking getting stuck in the middle of nowhere if there was a breakdown.  Her initial job assignment was as a ""tile scrubber"" which she resented at first, then came to a more stoic mindset about the job, embracing it.  Eventually she rose up the ranks while teaching them new tactics and helping to fight their local war.  In the end, she is reunited with Voyager."

1,After season one Dr. Crusher was replaced by Dr. Pulaski and now in season 3 Dr. Pulaski has been replaced by Dr. Crusher. The internet isn't giving me much. Does anyone know why they made these changes without giving either character some form of goodbye?
1,My wife and I were arguing about this as we are both hoping to see cetacean ops in the next season of Lower Decks. I argued that they were full officers and that the universal translator would allow us to communicate with the cetaceans. She countered with the fact that other “lower animals” of earth have been seen where the universal translator is useless (ie. Spot) and thus they would be more like a K-9 unit. We furthered wondered if cetacean ops would be limited to earth cetaceans or alien ones as well.
1,"**Don't read this if you haven't watched the entire series!!**

There's so much potential for what they left off with. Cardassia is basically in ruins, its people trying to rebuild their society after the dominion attacks. The dark side of the Federation and Star Fleet has been exposed, the Dominion is changing into something we can't really fathom at the moment, Ferengenar (Ferenginar?) is progressing as a society after being stagnant for so long, and who knows what's happening with the Klingons and Romulans. There are so many storylines they could follow with this, and they could maybe even touch on them all in varying degrees, but here's what I'd wanna see.

The series should have two main focuses: the rebuilding of Cardassia, and reforms happening within the Federation (maybe even a large number of planets wanting to secede). I wouldn't want the same characters from DS9, I'd want some new characters to be explored. But there would maybe have to be one or two characters brought back as main ones. 

Garak, I think, is one of them. He'd probably be pretty important in the rebuilding of Cardassia, as he was very influential in the resistance and even seemed to lead on after Damar was killed, so it'd make sense to bring him back as a main character in the Cardassia storyline. I'm not sure who another would be, but others may have nice ideas for that (go ahead and say who you think should be brought back 😀). Possibly Kira, as well. Though, they'd have to resolve the issue of Cardassian hatred of Bajorans 😅

But it'd be cool to see the Federation in an even more desperate state than they were in during the war, as if it's golden age just came to an end. I don't know what the story would look like exactly, but there's so much that could be done. Heck, they could even weave in a storyline about the changes to the dominion after Odo helped the founders to trust solids again. It'd be cool to see what would come of the Jem-hadar (not sure how to spell it) and the... Well, i forgot the name of the species, but they're the ones with the mushroom hair, blue eyes, and xylophone ears (and Weyoun was one of them).

This'll probably never happen, but it'd be really cool to see. I'd pay for another one of these streaming services (which I hate that this is becoming a trend now, by the way) just to watch this series."

1,"The Picard series is built around the idea that after a huge disaster at Mars, the Federation abandons plans to assist in the evacuation of Romulus. They suggest that helping the Romulans was already unpopular among some Federation worlds and this was the push that led them to 'let them die' as it were. However. . . . are we not forgetting the events of Star Trek 2009?

The Federation actually put together what must have been a massive research and development project to design and implement a radical plan to save Romulus. Not just it's people, but the entire system, and with it, it's empire. Despite the loss of so many ships and lives, the Federation was actually willing to invest huge resources to intervene to help it's main rival, something that Picard (both the man and series) seems to ignore. It was only through some unforeseen circumstances that Spock was too late to save them.

Have I missed something?"
0,Personally I think the Russo brothers would be a good choice.
0,"Stormtroopers are poor shooters, they can rebel and defect, i just don’t understand why the empire would replace the battle hardened, order obeying clones that almost wiped out every Jedi?"
1,"I've been putting my mind lately to different possible ways to watch Star Trek. There are issues around airdate, production date, chronological order, and series order. None of them truly capture all of what I'm looking for in a watch order: one that shows the story in the order it was mostly intended to be seen, without too much switching between series, and keeping a sequence meant to convey meaning.

I've put together a somewhat unconventional list. It's neither airdate nor production date nor series order, but takes elements of all of them. I'll describe it below with reasons for each switch, and then place a massive table with the whole list.

Like gagh, it's a little squirmy. But not too squirmy.

* The Cage

 * Even though it didn't air until the 1980s on TV, it's Trek's start and so the start of our journey

* TOS in production order

 * I think on the balance, production order better captures the creator's intent than air order, especially in season 1 where Where No Man Has Gone Before very clearly takes place before the rest of the season.

* TAS in airdate order

 * there wasn't much reason to put these in production order, and I think it's easier since this is the order they appear in DVDs and streaming

* Films 1-6

 * While 5 &amp; 6 aired during TNG, I feel they continue and wrap up the story of Kirk and crew, and should be stuck together

* TNG Encounter at Farpoint through to Chain of Command, Part 2

 * Using airdate for simplicity. I think there are some good arguments about production order for season 1, because it puts 11001001 before The Big Goodbye, but overall I think airdate works best.

 * Chain of Command was written intentionally to re-introduce the Cardassians and set the stage for DS9. Switching to DS9 here means that when DS9 character Quark and Bashir show up in season 6 and 7 of TNG we will have met them first on their own shows

* DS9 Emissary to Blood Oath

 * Using airdate here. The only real controverys is with respect to Past Prologue vs A Man Alone, and honestly it doesn't really matter. Past season 1, airdate I think always represents the writer's intent.

* TNG Ship in a Bottle to Journey's End

 * We have switched back to TNG to give greater context to the emergence of the Maquis

* DS9 The Maquis, Part I &amp; Part II

* TNG Firstborn to All Good Things...

* Star Trek Generations

 * Although it does take place a bit later, there's no reason to seperate it from the rest of TNG here

* DS9 Bloodlines to Past Tense, Part II

 * We are stopping here to pivot to Voyager. I wanted to stop at a natural pausing point in DS9 and also think about the state of the Federation when Voyager is lost. Things like the status of the Maquis, how much they'd know about the Dominion, etc.

* VOY Caretaker to Coda

 * The Borg do not appear on Voyager until after the film First Contact, which made some changes to them as a threat and as a people. So we pause now to wait for that film.

* DS9 Life Support to Ascent

 * Stopping here mostly because I didn't want to rob First Contact of its introduction of the new uniforms, and because if we go much further in DS9, it'll spoiled when it's mentioned by In Purgatory's Shadow

* Star Trek: First Contact

* Voyager: Unity to Waking Moments

 * Stopping here because going further spoils the outbreak of the Dominion War

* DS9 Rapture to Inquisition

 * Stopping here so that when the EMH IV says 'the Romulans aren't in the war' it is still true

* VOY Message in a Bottle to The Voyager Conspiracy

 * I like this run a lot, because it goes from Voyager's first quick contact with home until just before regular contact. Pathfinder clearly takes place post-war, so we're pausing until after DS9

* DS9 In the Pale Moonlight to It's Only a Paper Moon

 * Also a run I like thematically. This is a 'cost of war' chunk. 

* Star Trek: Insurrection

 * Placement is somewhat controversial. I think this is a good place for it because, Worf is mostly absent from It's Only a Paper Moon, it's a relative lull the war, and it comes before the Son'a get mentioned in DS9

* DS9 Prodigal Daughter to What You Leave Behind

* VOY Pathfinder to Endgame

* Star Trek Nemesis

 * Although it was released mid-ENT, I think it's better here as we wrap up this era of Trek and also conclude Janeway's story (at least in live action...)

* ENT by airdate

* The Kelvin Films (ST09, STID, STB)

* Discovery season 1

* Short Treks season 1

* Discovery season 2

* Short Treks season 2

* Picard season 1

 * Placing Picard before DSC 3 I think adds necessary context to the Ni'var episode

* Lower Decks season 1

* Discovery season 3

#Thoughts?"
1,"Gotta say I was extremely underwhelmed and disappointed. The Quark’s Bar glasses and coasters are awesome and I’ll totally use them a lot, but everything is king of useless junk. Like a tea infuser? Really?"
0,I began wondering this after blasting out to AC/DC and other 80s songs that fit under the retro category and thought that these songs could easily fit in the Star Wars universe.
1,"So that thing in the back of their head they wear............what's the meaning of it? Does it have a name?

Is it similar to how some jewish wear that head thing?"
1,"Got to the flashback scene of Michael on Vulcan, as Sarek’s pupil.

GF: “So is she a Vulcan?”

Me: “Check her ears.”

GF: “Big but not pointy... so what, she’s a replacement Spock?”

Me: (trying not to divulge too much) “Not quite...” 

GF: “So is she Vulcan?” 

Me: “I got the impression she was human... but there’s *something* there.”

GF: “So she’s autistic?”

I nearly choked."
0,"Count Dooku vs Luke. Who would win?

Me and my brother got into an argument about who would win and he isn't letting up. Could you guys give your opinions about this matchup? Thanks"
1,"Hi All,

Long time lurker, first time poster and insane Trekkie. So, I've been re-watching DS9 and paying closer attention to the Ferengi episodes. This question goes out to those of you that run your own businesses. Towards the end of last year, I decided to start up my own business doing IT Support / Computer Repairs which has made me look at all aspects of running a business, including profit!
Question - how long would you last if you ran your business according to the Rules of Acquisition? Would you see an increase in profit / revenue?

Mike"
0,"In Maul’s time of being an apprentice to Palpatine, Maul wasn’t technically a Sith Lord quite yet as Plagueis was still alive during Episode 1. And with the rule of 2, there can only be 2 Sith Lords and as Darth is a title only given to a Sith Lord, why did maul have it?"
0,"When Yoda speaks and does the verb-subject swap, how is that translated into non-english languages?  I know that not all languages follow the same sentence structure as english.  Is his speech in other ways altered?"
0,"So like everyone else on this sub I’ve seen the prequels like a million times. This recent time around I started from episode 1 and watched 2 the next day and 3 the day after. Honestly 1 and 2 hits about the same bc of the nostalgia but I will say haydens acting is so cringe and it’s hard to get around at times. 3 kinda fell short bc of the acting too, just wish they were more animated at times. Also the cgi on all 3 has not aged well and interrupted the immersion. Also the choreography of certain scenes.. It really kind of made me sad bc the acting and bad cgi at times ruined the old feeling of awe and wonder I had when I used to watch them. Props on natalie Portman being an amazing actress playing padme though. Ewan magregor also killed it as obi wan although I wished he was a little more expressive at times. Overall, still enjoyed the rewatches and I love The prequels and Star Wars in general so much but goddamn time can be a sunovanbitch.. id like to know everyone else’s thoughts on the prequels from their most recent rewatch. 

Ps: one detail I noticed that I somehow never did before or maybe just forgot about was when obi wan said “so uncivilized” i always thought he was referring to general grevious upon killing him but he was actually referring to the blaster 😂"
0,Well Your Wrong he actually help import children into slavery (apparently)
1, A lot of the science is clearly made up jargon but to make it sound like you know what you are talking about in a certain way it seems like that would take a lot of work.  LeVar Burton certainly had a lot of this type of dialog but he always manages to make it sound like he knows what he is talking about.  I don't think a lot of actors could
1,So I just finished a rewatch of Cause and Effect and I was wondering  if there is any lore or articles on how the federation debriefs a ship from another time. The Bozman was lost for 80 years so perhaps there is a reaclimation period for situations like this.
1,"As a retro PC collector, I have recorded my entire collection of Star Trek MIDI music with an OPL3 sound card and uploaded it to YouTube.

Dial-up connection, small hard drive capacities, poor computer performance – these were one of the reasons why besides MP3 files, MIDI music was popular in the 90s. Compared to MP3s, MIDI files were only fraction of the size, making them ideal for downloads even with slow internet speeds.

However, you won’t be able to play MIDI music just like that anymore, and if you would in fact manage to play it somehow, it would sound different compared to the computer you had under your desk when you were younger. While playing an MP3 file produces the same sound on any machine, MIDI files are interpreted differently by different sound cards, depending on the specific chip soldered on the card. Of course, if your PC is able to play MIDI music, it will sound different – the tunes will be the same, but the sound will be different.

And so, the only truly reliable way to ensure truly authentic playback of MIDI music, is old hardware. However, that is becoming rarer and rarer over time. Surprisingly, I was able to find only 3 recordings of Star Trek MIDI music of this type on YouTube, and to avoid it being lost forever, I have played it on a PC from 1995 with the right chip on the sound card (OPL3) and uploaded it to YouTube for anyone to enjoy even on modern hardware.

And if you ask why there’s no Insurrection, Enterprise and all the other good stuff... well, kids, this collection is from time when First Contact and Voyager were the newest of the newest.

Let the ultimate retro begin!

1,"They watch (or re-watch) a Voyager episode and talk about it. It's currently an ongoing podcast. So far, I listened to the one about Voyager pilot and... had to ... ""Threshold"". It was really interesting to hear the logistics behind the different transformation stages straight from the actors point of view. Some find it boring, but I really like hearing about these kind of things. Makes me want to re-watch Voyager episode and then listen to the next pilot."
0,"Set in the Legends/Expanded universe continuity sometime after the events of *Return of the Jedi*, our heroes from the original trilogy are sent by the New Republic to Endor for diplomatic purposes. Accompanying them are Cindel Towani and Noa Briqualon from the tv movie, *Ewoks: The Battle for Endor*. While Leia and the others help with diplomatic business at Bright Tree Village, Luke trains a new generation of Jedi. Suddenly, Bright Tree Village is attacked by a band of Sanyassan marauders. Our heroes come to the rescue, resulting in the marauders retreating after majority of their party is killed by blasters and lightsabers, but not before kidnapping Cindel. One of the marauders is injured and is interrogated by our heroes with Chewbacca holding him in place. He explains that he and his men were under orders from the son of the late King Terak, King Zakul, and his second-in-command, the Nighsister, Charal, who was able to regain human form after having a blacksmith repair the Talisman of the Raven. Before deciding to launch an attack on the Marauders stronghold, Wicket and Noa tell our heroes about her previous encounter with with them and Charal.

Back at the marauder's stronghold, King Zakul expresses his anger at Cindel, blaming her for the death of his father despite it Wicket being responsible. He and Charal are also visited by members of the Imperial Remnant who offer to help them and the marauders leave Endor. As part of the deal, Charal is made empress and is given an experimental four pronged super star destroyer called the Raven to serve as her flagship. As they are about to leave, New Republic forces attack the stronghold. The Mauraders army are able to hold off the New Republic forces long for Charal, Zakul, and other maraders to escape on an imperial shuttle, taking Cindel with them.

After the attack on the stronghold, Luke and the others, now accompanied by Teek, return to the Millennium Falcon to discuss a plan to rescue Cindel. R2-D2 picks up a transmission from the Raven. The message is from now Empress Charal who demands that the New Republic surrender to the Remnant. After contacting Coruscant, Luke

The New Republic fleet launches an attack the Raven and the star destroyers accompanying it. Once they've landed in the hanger, Luke, accompanied by Wicket, Teek, and Noa rush to the throne room, where Cindel is locked in a cage and is being tortured by Charal and Zakul. Kakul tries to kill Luke with his machete, only for the blade to be sliced in half by the Jedi's lightsaber. The sanyassan is in shock for five seconds before he is killed by Luke. The Jedi then orders Charal to surrender and release Cindel. The Nightsister refuses and surprises Luke by revealing her own lightsaber that she's kept hidden for some time. Luke and Charal engage in a duel while Wicket, Teek, and Noa free Cindel. Luke is able to put up a good fight but is overpowered as he is unfamiliar with Nightsister magic. Charal is about o kill the Jedi only for Cindel to grab Noa's gun and repeatingly shoot at the Nightsister, killing her. The five are able to escape just before the Raven is destroyed.

The story ends with goodbyes between the heroes."

1,"I really didn't like this plot. He was a Starfleet officer, supposed to be schooled in and uphold the highest ideals in discipline, morals, self-sacrifice  etc. etc. but yet makes an exceptionally selfish decision to blow up a facility which could result in hundreds of deaths (I always thought the official number they gave, 42 deaths, was way too low for a building that size) just to save his daughter's life? 

 Even if Khan threatened to kill him, his wife, and daughter if he refused he should have pretended to go through with it and then secretly alert Starfleet who could have evacuated his family. Instead he chose to murder a bunch of innocent lives, killed himself because he couldn't live with the shame, and scarred his daughter for life when she grows up and finds out what her father did."

0, They sure didn’t really have a purpose after that since even the empire found them to be impressive and such. It’s also weird trying to live a normal life after that knowing you went through talk that training and you were the guard of one of worst people to ever exist.
1,"Watching Tomorrow is Yesterday, which in every other respect is a great episode, has weird sort of end to it.  As they are heading back home via on return trip around the sun they help their passengers out by beaming them into themselves!  This is so they won't remember their time on the Enterprise.  That just seems weird to me, and given what we are told about transporters I don't think should be able to work. However it does so it useful to know in the future if someone from the the past gets too much knowledge just remember to beam them into themselves so they forget. 

On a second note when this episode was in draft form it was originally going to follow The Naked Time, that is why that one also had the strange ending.  However since they moved when the episode happened they needed a different way to accidently go into the past.   This means Captain Kirk discovered TWO methods of time travel completely by accident! What a captain!

1,"So I just watched this episode for the first time, yeah I know, and I have seen this episode in many top 5's and has always been highly regarded. I do agree that the episode is a lot of fun but I had an issue with the way the problem was resolved. Spoilers ahead.



So they are able to send a signal back to Data with the 3's which indicated to listen to the suggestion Riker gave, but how would they have known that Riker had the correct idea? When it comes down to the final decision before the ship explodes, how would they even remember that it was a decision between Riker and Data's suggestion if they ""die"" immediately afterwards. Furthermore, they sent this message of ""3"" back before they got into this decision that decided the fate of the ship....so if they already knew to send back ""3"" and listen to Riker, why did they not listen to Riker the same day they sent back the signal?"

0,"Get ready to read, but I assure you, I will give you some insight and characterization to a clone you may've not even heard about or at least don't remember. He was only in 2 episodes in the show after all. So please, for Denal's sake, who died valiantly after almost defeating Cad Bane, read this post...


Look Denal was one of the OG Clones of the 501st, and was a Veteran Trooper, a baddass much like Rex. Survived multiple battles alongside Rex and Anakin. Literally kinda more skilled than Rex, but only in two areas. Shooting a DC-15a and hacking &amp; splicing computers. Rex is a master with a DC-17 Blaster Pistol but Denal is JUST as good with a Dc-15a, he's probably better with it than Cody. DENAL COULD PROBABLY SURPASS CODY IN SKILL GIVEN THE TIME. Let's be honest here bois, that is fact. Denal shoots his blaster VERY fast and he has survived an encounter with Grievous, not many Clones without plot-armor can say that. Finally Denal talked about having experience with hacking, as he asked Rex if he could open the locked door they were at. So that means he has some experience in hacking and splicing which we know Rex has none in that area.

Denal is more OG than Fives, Echo, Hardcase, Jesse, Kix or any other member of the 501st you spit at me. The only person that can maybe be more OG is that Clone who was apart of Torrent Company in the movie and came back in Season 7 and almost  died from the fury of Maul (Forgot his name), but lets be honest. With how skilled at surviving or almost surviving... (Flashback to him almost defeating Cad Bane *Crys a single tear*) impossible encounters there is a GOOD chance one of the clone survivors of Torrent Company in the movie was actually Denal, so he is still the most OG clone. I would NOT be surprised if he was one of the clones with Anakin in the towers on Cristophsis. Almost guaranteed actually, given how bad the situation and how good Denal is at getting out of bad situations. 

Now let's be honest here bois, Denal was no doubt ARC trooper level, only survivor of the that Listening Post in Duel of the Droids (forgot its name again and too lazy to look it up) and Rex doesn't count, he's Rex after all... (And neither does that Clone Pilot, he wasn't there for literally any of it. Wouldn't be surprised if his name was Coward or something). Sad thing is he never got out of the Phase 1 armor Era, which had no newly trained ARC Troopers, like Fives &amp; Echo. The only ARCs in the Phase 1 Era were either Null-Class or Commanders or Captains like Rex and Cody. Only during Phase 2 was regular clone troopers that proved to be exceptional in combat selected to be trained to be ARC Troopers. So Denal never had the chance.

There is no doubt, and this even isn't opinion, that Denal would've made ARC Trooper WAY before the bois did (Fives &amp; Echo) if he just barely survived his fateful encounter with Cad Bane or didn't go at all (Wait I'm a fanfiction writer... I could write his survival...?). Denal's veterancy would've no doubt proved incredibly useful during the Citadel and on Umbara. He and Rex could've probably taken on a squad of Citadel Commando droids by themselves, and on Umbara Denal would be kind of a middle ground between Krell &amp; Dogma and Rex, Fives, Hardcase, and Jesse. Let me explain, Denal seems like a no-nonsense and somewhat of a by-the-book type of Clone much like Cody, but does have some independent and risky natures, like Rex. He's in the gray area for the Clones, which is kinda rare. Denal's not like Cody and Dogma who follow orders without question yet he is similar, and he's not like the risky and incredibly independent Rex and Fives (And technically Hardcase, he is an extreme of the example), yet again... very similar. In the 501st that is a rare thing, given that you always have extremes of each example, Dogma never questioned his orders and only wanted to serve the GAR and the Jedi. Hardcase said f*ck that shit and just essentially ignored Krell's suicidal orders and questioned him around every turn. You can't find many 501st Clones in the ""gray"" area, even Rex isn't one like you might expect. Rex is an always follow orders kind of guy but when it comes to suicidal and idiotic plans or assaults he will question it until the end of time, and he only gives in to the idiotic plans because he's so loyal and in the end a Clone, who is bred specifically for utmost loyalty (Anakin's plans don't count, Rex'll always do those without question). 

Now this may trigger you a bit... Denal is such a 501st veteran and been with Rex for so long that we'd likely see Denal as Rex's second instead of Fives. Fives is best bro yes, i am in no way in hell denying that (If i was I'd be a heretic). But just think about it. Fives only became apart of the 501st because of the Rishi Moon incident, and was quite a bit after Denal mainly did his thing (I believe, i may be wrong). So when Fives became a idk... PFC or PVT, Denal was most likely a Sergeant or Lieutenant by then (At the time of the Duel of the Droids episode, i believe Denal was only a Sergeant, 100%, it just makes the most sense). So being the second only ARC Trooper in the 501st (Rex was the first, and Denal's training would be before Fives and Echo's), and i think the second highest rank (Both formally and in Rex's eyes ;) as ""Experience outranks everything"" and Denal, no doubt has the expertise &amp; experience) Denal would be Rex's second in command. Of course Anakin and Ahsoka would be above him but in terms of Clones, Denal is second in command. I am tempted to call it fact as it almost is given the prior evidence and assumption, but i can't call it that because we sadly didn't see it, as Denal fell fighting Cad Bane, who was the Boba Fett of the time. 

Denal is sleeped on Clone and absolutely deserves more recognition. Given his veterancy, Denal could have single-handedly swayed the outcome of any battle he was in.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk"
1,Does the bridge going dark during a red alert help with reaction time/focus or does it just make for more dramatic entertainment? 🤔
0,Ok so I'm years behind on the jargon around the SW galaxie. I saw one reddit group for the Canon version. However when I looked none of the books I read years ago were listed. I thought the original novels and such from prior to Disney was considered the Canon. Has that changed completely? What else has been changed since Disney took over?
1,"Sisko: The Prophets told me not to take part in the upcoming mission because something terrible will happen if I do.

Ross: Look Ben, we're all space atheists here at Starfleet, so in spite of my decades of experience in diverse situations, and in spite of logic and a supposed appreciation of other cultures and unique situations, I'm going to need you to do your duty!

What? Bajor is a warp-capable civilization so the Prime Directive doesn't apply. The Bajorans are free to consider Sisko to be the Emissary if they want, and aside from accumulating some ill will from telling Bajor to wait to join the Federation, they really have no standing to dislike it. The Prophets aren't imaginary, they are beings that exist outside of time and can see the future. The Prophets cut the Dominion forces off from the Gamma Quadrant because Sisko asked them to. While the Prophets warning does turn out to be a warning, it could easily be interpreted as a threat, like ""you stay here or else!"". How does Ross know that forcing Sisko to take part in the mission won't anger the Prophets and cause them to start allowing Dominion ships through the wormhole?"
1,"Basically the title. From what I've heard Voyager can get dull and weird at time, I need a list of all episodes that aren't. Thanks in advance."
0,"I love this conversation in Episode VI more than any other in Star Wars. People tend to (ahem) underestimate the power of the Dark Side, in reference specifically to its hold on those who fell into its grasp. Anakin was slowly manipulated and groomed to be a Sith Lord for thirteen years by a man he trusted with all his heart, and was then trapped, seemingly forever, in his own mind, unable to break out. He genuinely believes that he is a lost cause, even though you can see that, since learning his son was alive, he's started wanting to be himself again. It was hate that gave Darth Vader the strength to take over Anakin Skywalker, and it was love that gave Anakin Skywalker the strength to come back. To return. And the return of the Jedi is the greatest story in all of Star Wars: it's the return of Anakin. (my favorite SW film is Rogue One though. fight me)

1,"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/m417vn/why_do_all_star_trek_shows_have_three_or_five/), I did some katra-searching. After some consideration I got taxonomic. Naming conventions for Star Trek and its spin-off series can be placed into three categories: concept/idea, locale/setting, or outliers.

# Concept/Idea

 🖖🏾 *Star Trek* – TOS/TAS – “And you people... you’re all... astronauts? On... some kind of star trek?”

 🖖🏾 *Star Trek: The Next Generation* – TNG – Not your momma’s *Star Trek* (see also: *Degrassi*). The same *Star Trek* you know and love but involves people born outside the original era portrayed in TOS/TAS.

 🖖🏾 *Star Trek: Short Treks* – ST – Alliterative. Should be “STS” as an homage to the space transportation system whose test flight vehicle carried the name of the ship from ENT. Features short, self-contained stories within the Star Trek universe^(\[1\]) (STU). 

 🖖🏾 *Star Trek: Lower Decks* – LDS – Nostalgia bait. References an obscure, much-panned, late series episode of TNG. Revolves around individuals who are not senior officers.

 🖖🏾 *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds* – SNW – Nostalgia bait. References a deep-cut quote from TOS and, later, TNG. This series returns to the exploratory (alien/planet of the week) nature of past Trek. Cranial ridges TBD.

# Locale/Setting

 🖖🏾 *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine –* DS9 – Nostalgia bait. References the existence of deep space stations (see also: Deep Space Station K-7; Deep Space 5) within the STU (do NOT see also: Leola Root Stew).

0,"Count Dooku is one of my favorite characters. His erudite manner and overwhelmingly complete abilities as a combatant make him a model of what I think a good villain should be. Which is why I have never been able to understand his relationship with Sidious. Dooku’s age, politics, and abilities make it hard for me to believe he would willingly submit to Sidious as an apprentice. The story would make way more sense if we got to see some tension between the two, as if it isn’t really clear who is master and who is apprentice. It would also offer a more compelling end. 

In my head, the story should have been that Dooku left the Order after Qui-Gon’s death and the council’s refusal to take serious Obi-Wan’s claims that the Sith have returned. Dooku eventually tracks down Sidious and they duel, but sensing that there’s more to Sidious’s plans and that he may not be able to beat him outright because their powers are too closely matched, they call a truce. They are each neither master nor apprentice, but co-conspirators. Together, they defeat Darth Plagueis and initiate the Separatist Crisis. But throughout the entire process they constantly attempt to undermine one another, with Dooku still holding some allegiance to the light side of the force even if he believes the jedi need to be destroyed. A nice rivalry between he and Mace Windu who were said to be equals as duelists in their younger days would parallel nice with Sidious’s eventual fight with Yoda and Obi-Wan’d duel with Anakin. Where Mace is a champion of the light with dark side tendencies, Dooku is a champion of the dark side with light side tendencies. And Windu’s inability to see what Dooku is trying to do by infiltrating the Sith convinces Dooku that the jedi are ultimately a lost cause and need to be destroyed. The story could’ve been so much more satisfying."

Just watched Into Darkness today and was wondering why isnt Rey and the gang featured inside. Isn’t the film taken place after Ep6 and the same time period as Ep7 and onwards??!!"
1,"TL,DR: watched Discovery S1 for the first time after not caring about it since release, general opinion has changed and am enjoying it so far. 



I remember trying to watch Discovery when it first started airing, but for whatever reason I couldn't really get into it and just pretty much just ignored it existed from then on. I've watched the previous series, including Picard, but Discovery just didn't grab my interest at first. I guess I was more into the older style of Star Trek than the newer stuff. 

However, I've been a heavy lurker of this sub for a while, as I like to read about other people's thoughts and insights when they share their thoughts upon watching one of the series for the first time, and I've seen many a post regarding Discovery and the events that have happened this far. But not having watched it myself, none of the details made sense, so I was unaware of events that had taken place this far. 

After giving it some thought, I decided to bite the bullet and give Discovery a round two, to see what happens. I've made it through the first season so far, and while it's definitely different from the older series, it's not the hot mess that I guess I came to believing initially. 

Now I didn't go into this completely blind, I do know the general overview of the plot throughout the seasons, I just didn't know any of the specifics. I am looking forward to watching the second season, and then the third.

One thing I will say though, is that I've always been the type to enjoy the starships themselves and their respective designs, and while the Discovery is slowly growing on me, it's still one of those 'this thing looks kinda weird' situations. Perhaps as I watch more it'll grow on me some more. 

Until then, seems to be a decent show. Thanks for reading."
1,"Did anyone else get a super heavy DS9 feel towards the latest season of Discovery? Things like the Trill, a ship named Nog, the Orion syndicate even Su'Kal had a vague reminiscence to Rom. Then there's Dr. Culber who's appearance was changed to that of a Bajoran. There where mentions of Deep Space stations and that whole thing with trying to get Su'Kal to leave the hologramatic environment.
Felt like there where a lot of reminders that pointed in the direction of DS9. Just wondering if maybe they are planning something. Maybe DS9 still exists after all this time and maybe we will visit."
1,"Hey guys, just wondering has anyone ever noticed weird continuity error with episodes of Star Trek?

I don't necessarily mean like stardate being wrong, or species redesigns (the Trill) or that borg baby in Voyager being stripped for parts.

So I resently rewatched Voyager and one episode annoyed me far more then it should have. S2 ep8 Persistence of Vision, Janeway calls Kes to the bridge, Kes acknowledges this and says she'll be there right away... But she never comes to the bridge!! 10mins later, we cut to sick Bay and she's still there! Voyager had encountered a ship that was manipulating the crew telepathically and Kes was the only one immune... It was vital for her to get to the bridge and she just wasn't bothered!

1,"An intriguing idea came to me while I was watching the Stargate episode ""The Tok'ra"".  It somehow got me thinking about the Trill in Star Trek.

The main gist of my thought was that the parasitic aliens in TNG's episode ""Conspiracy"", were perhaps distantly related to the Trill Symbiotes. Perhaps a very long time ago, the Conspiracy Parasites broke away from the Trill Symbiotes and travelled to live in another part of the galaxy (sorta like the Romulans broke away from the Vulcans) due to irreconcilable ideological differences.  The main differences beings as follows:

1. Trill Symbiotes prefer not to fully take over their host, but rather join together with them in an equal partnership (similar to Tok'ra in Stargate)
2. But the Conspiracy parasites want to completely take control of their host until nothing of the host remains (similar to the Goa'uld in Stargate)

Does this sound like it's a possibility to anyone, or have I just been watching too much sci-fi lately?"

0,"I know plenty of us were cynical about a bit corporate entity swinging in and commodifying an American cinematic legend, but TROS is the epitome of just that happening. I enjoyed TFA despite how much of a thinly veiled reboot of ANH it was, something that was completely unnecessary considering its freaking Star Wars. I even enjoyed TLJ despite how weird that movie was. I have my problems with the PT as well, going so far as to feel AOTC didn't seem like a Star Wars movie at all. But Johnson and Lucas had their hearts in the right place. JJ just wanted to be the center of attention. Star Trek 2009 was a clunky but really fun actioner. Into Darkness was a train wreck that is still the worst Trek film. Not long after, he was signed to do TFA and I was afraid he'd fuck up Star Wars too. He didn't do it then, he waited until 2019.

What a damn mess TROS is from beginning to end. Why in the world did that hack writer Chris Perrio get involved with Star Wars? Did they need tk backpeddle from TLJ? No, they didn't.

What a just freaking disaster. I wish Disney would just pretend it never happened and we could start over."

1,"I love all the Star Trek series, so this is in no way hating on any of it. I'm just curious what is your least favorite tropes across all ST shows? For me it's anytime someone is on trial (with the exception of DS9's Duet which is in my top ten favorite episodes across all of Star Trek). Also I'm not a fan of episodes where characters are trapped inside the holodeck with the exception of TNG's Ship in a Bottle which is also in my top ten). 

The funny thing is both my exceptions besides being among my favorites have something else in common. In Duet it's not one of the major characters on trial, and in Ship in a Bottle while it is major characters in the holodeck, they don't realize it until near the end, it a minor character that's actually trapped in the holodeck. So maybe it's okay to repeat a trope as long as it's not centered around a major character? Not sure but it happens to work out this way. 

What are your least favorite tropes?"

0,"The game felt really nice. With all my experience in watching all the different media forms of Star Wars, it felt really good to dive into such an explorative game that tried to capture the essence of the Star Wars universe. It was really neat fighting various creatures, variants of stormtroopers, and other enemies associated with the empire.

And, I've gotta say. The main cast of characters, along with the various antagonists? Stellar job done here as I loved them all. I only wish a few of them got more screentime. 

If you haven't played it, I'd definitely recommend! Or, at the very least, watch a video of all the cutscenes or something. What a fun experience that was. Felt like fanservice in the good way. I really hope we get to see Cal and company in at least the form of cameo in the future since Fallen Order is considered canon."

There's so much in it, I'm overwhelmed by it all. Love this show. Haven't seen any other Star Trek shows in full and I can't imagine they're this good, I just feel I would cheat on Picard haha"
0,"I just watched *The Wrong Jedi* episode of the Clone Wars for the first time, in which Ashoka is falsely accused of bombing the Jedi Temple, and I really think the ending may very well be the saddest moment in all of Star Wars. Don't get me wrong, there are a plethora of moments in Star Wars that are more *tragic*, but this was just incredibly *sad*. I finally and completely understand why Anakin distrusts the council so much in Episode III, and the thing is; he is absolutely right. When Mace Windu had the guts to say that this was all a test for Ashoka, I was infuriated. After the council did Ashoka so dirty, Anakin should have totally left the Order, without looking back for a second. 

I guess the reason for this post is simply to say how much The Clone Wars adds to the saga and especially to the character of Anakin. This episode in particular makes his story even more tragic, and his fall to the dark side and turn against the Jedi more believable. Anyway, I'm very much looking forward to the last two seasons. This is such an incredible show."

1,"I just started watching Stargate sg-1. I feel like if you are into Star Trek you would really like Stargate.  I've only watched up to season 5 so far but in many instances they deal with Star trek Esque situations much more realistically and the show overall seems to be better written.  It seems like the only thing it is missing is the Picard speeches.  But the stories so far make perfect sense and are very good. Very few plot holes in the series so far and the do the techno babble very well.

What really bothered me in Star Trek is they never bother to build a true alliance or partnership with the more advanced races and entities.   You know that Q exists and there's no initiative to work with Q?  How about the one dude that lives on the planet by himself that eradicated in an entire race of aliens with a thought?  Maybe recruit him?  The super advanced race in the center of the Galaxy that took over broccoli for a moment?  Maybe trade some technology?

Star Trek never seems to be interested in gaining new technologies from these races/entities.  This is what bothered me the most about Star Trek and where Stargate really shines.

So Starfleet wants to investigate a secret Cardassian weapons lab and they want Picard to go because he knows a lot about a certain tech thingy.

Also, Starfleet didn't arrange any method of insertion and extraction for Picard's team, so Crusher has to give a Ferengi the equivalent of a handjob to get passage. It's a little daft."

The casual conversations were perhaps my favorite part, they just talk, but are ingenious and fun, like if you know them since always like when Chief O'Brian said ""I should invite Julian to live with us"" when talking about how Keiko and Kira were talking about him. Even when the talk isn't as relevant, and Worf and Odo seem a bit out of their serious character for being a little sarcastic when talking, but I wouldn't mind to see more of Odo and Worf like that. It's an attribute that imo isn't shown always. Also the plot is amazing, clever and intriguing, I particularly liked how many archs from different episodes come together here.

Well. At a certain points they would just win. With the best arms tech and the best shield tech, etc etc.

Here is what I think the borg strat is.
 
1) they notice/discover a new species
 
2) they send a cube to scare the ever loving shit out of that species (hello wolf 359)
 
3) they wait for the species to study the borg tech and find the counter measure. 
 
4) they assimilate that knowledge and advance the tech
 
5) repeat.

1,"Okay so in season 2 episode 15 of DS9 titled ""Paradise"" we are introduced to a colony of people on a planet in the gamma quadrant, now as we find out later in the episode they didn't end up there by accident in fact the planet was specifically chosen after much research, except it's in the gamma quadrant and the ship there landed 10 years earlier well before the discovery of the wormholeso how the hell did they get there and how the hell did they know it was there the gamma quadrant is at least 50 years away at high Warp.  Now if this was a different sci-fi property say ender's game then the problem is not as big because in that people are kept Young by traveling at near light speed but that's obviously not the way it works in Star Trek and that would still leave a lot of problems so how the hell did the people end up there I feel like this must have been an episode written for a different Star Trek show because it really doesn't work in deep space nine."

My first major memory of star wars was playing that old Lego game on my DS still never finished it I think I got to kashyyyk I think I dont remember much of the game, then few years later I remember getting Lego Star Wars 3 the clone wars honestly still the best Lego game ever.  


  
As I got older star wars just sat in my memory I watched like parts of the movie when it came on TV but never fully watched the show I got like one lightsaber when i was growing up it was cool but damn that thing hurts like hell. These last few months I've finally gotten back into star wars watching the classic movies but never enjoying the newer ones they just didnt feel like star wars they never entertained me.  


  
I recently finished Jedi fallen order and i really enjoyed it (Becides the MANY broken mechanics of the game) its a really interesting story I would kill to see it be made into a series its just got many interesting parts to it and it might be enjoyable yaknow if we dont let those ""Nice people"" at Disney touch it let jon favreau and the team who worked on the Mandalorian make the series.

1,You could have say Wesley being an engineer and Diana and seven of nine returning in some way.  Worf could be a recurring character as a  liaison of some kind between the Klingon's and federation.  There is all kinds of ideas you could do with a show like this.  Give it more self contained episodes to or more just have lighter story arcs among the self contained episodes.
0,"B1 Battle Droids are interesting to me as they were mass produced for an army and had next to no personality. As the Clone Wars went on, they began to develop personalities of their own as seen with their sarcastic remarks in the shows and movies. The show would center around one B1 Battle Droid that had avoided having it’s memory wiped so it would develop a personality different from the other droids. The point of the show would be to show the important of droids, how they acted with each other, and showing how a droid with feelings it picked up from fighting for a reason it did not know would act. Any ideas and criticisms to this story idea are welcome."

0,"so in The Mandalorian season 2, Bo-Katan appears, although she looks like she hasn't aged a day, even though she'd be in her 50s by then, so what I'm thinking is maybe one of her ancestral lines was of an aline species that ages really slower than normal people, so because this is apart of her ancestry and genetics, she has this ability. 

also, this isn't some theory or something that will be big in Star Wars in the future, I just thought I'd give my explanation for why Bo-Katan didn't age in The Mandalorian season 2, that's really it, but I would love to hear your explanations in the comments below if you have any."

Odo looked like Odo did because it was how he decided to look, and from memory he was pretty pants at making human faces when he was wee.  When he got older he kept his Odo look as that was what he was used to.  Why do the other founders, who are, and were better shifters, look like melted action figures?  I get why from a writing point of view as it makes it obvious, but why from a cannon point of view?"

1,"The characters of DS9 (except Worf) never went onto the Big Screen. The Way of the Warrior (WoW) was Star Trek's first full length TV Movie. Voyager did this a few times as well I believe. But, until this episode all other 2 parters in Star Trek TV were planned and shot as a two-part episode. Not WoW; it was shot as a 1hr33 min (according to IMdB) feature length tv movie. But I always wonder...

If WoW was given today's budget (I'll make it easy not to use 1990's dollars), plus add a little to the film  I maintain that it would be one of the best Star Trek movies ever made. So I'll ask the community for fun to do just that!

My only guidelines, is not to go crazy on the budget (not Avengers: Endgame money, something reasonable like $50-$100 mil), increase the running time by about 20-40 min so it's closer to 2hrs like most modern theatrical films, and maybe add a character or two. The Way of the Warrior movie would have modern special effects, 4K HDR and sound, and the budget of films in the 21st Century. But, the film would largely stay the same as the episode we know. I will come back later with my idea, but I wanted to put this out in the universe to get the party started."

I understand that they wanted to make the show about how primitive the tech was but I think that they exaggerated this aspect, or maybe I am just too picky.

1,"Hello! To start this off, I'm a university student with a love for Star Trek. Right now in my journalism class, we're doing audio stories (essentially short podcasts) about a chosen topic, and I picked Trek. For my story, I'd love to get a few interviews with Star Trek fans about their own personal story with Star Trek, and what drew them to the franchise and kept them engaged. 

I'm not looking for a specific demographic or reason for liking Trek, in fact, the more differences the better! Because this is an audio story, video chat isn't necessary, and I don't have to include your last name if it's something you're not comfortable with. 

I should also mention that this story isn't made to be published, it's an assignment, but I will still be treating it as a news story. Interviews would be conducted over Skype or Zoom with or without webcams, and will probably last no more than 15 minutes max. 

So! If you're a Star Trek fan who's interested in and willing to do a brief interview before the end of February, please comment below or DM me with your first name, age, and a brief synopsis of why Trek matters to you! I'll shoot you a message and we can set up an interview.

Thanks in advance! I'm really interested in hearing stories about what Trek means to different people, it's such a rich franchise with so many wonderful things!"
0,"I’m currently re-watching the clone wars leading up to Season 7 and I don’t exactly understand why they moved toward peace while also getting rid of a standing military. Violence isn’t always the answer sure and I get the move to draw back from the warrior culture, but New Mandalore has essentially opened itself to any enemy that wants to take their resources. Besides security they barely have the resources to quell an active terrorist organization in the form of the Death Guard. Which they are semi justified in that their culture has been stomped out nearly instantaneously. Maybe there’s a bit of a larger discussion here absolute peace and the consequence of not having a force to protect your own citizens."

0,No one has noticed this but Padmé has actually been flirting with Anakin since the first movie. She has been manipulating Anakin since he was young knowing his medaclorian count was high. So when he awkwardly tells her that he loves her it doesn’t surprise her. Also when they get married it is just one step better for her.   When she gets pregnant with Anakin’s children she makes Anakin dream about her dying. So then it drives him to the dark side refusing to believe in the Jedi order. Knowing his medaclorian count was high in the beginning she started to manipulate him so later he would join the dark side. She even faked her own death pushing Anakin farther towards the dark side.
0,"Regardless of personal feelings about the ST in general, I feel most bad about how Luke was treated. Especially after having read the EU books, turning Luke into a lonely old man feels wrong.

I suppose they were still on the whole ""Love is bad for a Jedi"" schtick, but then went on to show Leia getting Jedi training while having a family, so I'm at a loss.

0,"So thanks to watching Clone Wars, Rebels, The Mandalorian, and all three trilogies, my significant other REALLY wants to check out some of the books to learn more about the lore and universe of Star Wars.  In terms of Legends, I recommended the original Thrawn books by Timothy Zahn, the Dark Empire comics, the Darth Bane trilogy, and Plagueis.  In terms of Disney Canon, I recommended the Aftermath trilogy and Bloodlines.  Are there any other for either Legends or Canon that you guys could recommend?"
1,"I'm trying to come up with two new words for ""in-story"" and ""out-story"".  Whenever I explain why something happens in a work of fiction, there is an ""in-story"" reason and an ""out-story"" reason.  The in-story reason explains why the event happened in terms of the narrative, whereas the out-story reason explains what the author wanted.


For instance, in the Star Trek TV series, Starfleet ships have no cloaking devices.  Only the Klingons and Romulans have them.  The in-story reason is that the Federation signed a treaty at one point in which they promised to never use cloaking tech in their ships.  The out-story reason is that the writers of the show felt that cloaking tech did not fit the honest and forthright character of the Federation; in the lead writer's words, the good guys ""don't sneak around"".

So I'd like to, using ancient Greek, come up with words for ""in-story"" and ""out-story"".  I've thought of *extragetic* and *endogetic*, based on what I've gleaned from online sources.  I don't know if my proposals are good, but you get what I'm going for, right?

These two words would be very useful whenever fans discuss their favorite shows, and why this or that happened."

1,"I did not watch Voyager straight through when it orriginaly aired, as that was when I moved away from home (and cable television), and we are now watching it with our kids, 12 and 10.

Are there episodes of Voyager that are to adult for their ages in your opionion ? Mainly we are on the lookout for overly sexual, graphicly violent, or very disturbing content. For example, we did not finish 'Meld' se2 ep 16 because the nature of that sort of , 'just because', random killer mentality is not something we wanted them exposed to.

He's like Data, he knows everything. He even sounds like Data."" He's not completely wrong...! He's a pretty smart kid, but the concept of the ""human barometer"" in Trek is probably a little beyond (no pun intended) a 9-year-old's comprehension, so I didn't try to explain it."
0,I still don't understand how the New Republic doesn't seem to notice or care that millions of babies had gone missing or kidnapped during the 30 years between ROTJ and TFA. Wouldn't people think it's weird? Wouldn't they report it to the NR? And how did the First Order go about kidnapping babies? Did they just knock on peoples' doors and take their babies away from them? Do they just sneak into nurseries and steal babies while everyone was asleep? What gives?
1,"Trek has long been lauded for depicting a model of high-diversity cooperation between all races and aliens, but they're always roughly on the same level with respect to capabilities and growth potential, at least compared to Data or the EMH.   


Either, if they desired to and were allowed to do it, could grow themselves into something so far beyond their crewmates that continuing to serve in their original capacity would become unbearably stifling. TNG solves this by having Data idealize humanity &amp; strive to embody it. Ok but what if he didn't? What if he wanted to explore his potential?  


The EMH kind of pushes up against these boundaries in the S6E3 ""Virtuoso"" where he basically becomes Hatsune Miku to an entire species (the Qomar) which somehow never invented music. As the Qomar adore him, he initially wants to permanently leave the ship and live with them.   


The episode returns to the status quo by the end though, resolving the situation by having the  Qomar copy the Doctor with improvements to his vocal range which somehow are impossible without clearing up more space by deleting medical knowledge (a metaphor for giving up important parts of yourself for your career when you sell out) conveying the lesson that fame is fickle, friends are forever.   


However Janeway's reaction to the doctor leaving sounds like a plantation owner exasperated that her slave is unhappy despite letting him live in the house, take meals with the family, etc. She does not exhibit the same enlightened attitude that Picard had towards Data in The Measure of a Man. Is this just a personality difference? Is Janeway retrograde on the issue of AI rights? Or has something changed culturally in the federation between TNG and Voyager?   


The Doylist explanation imo is that infinite diversity in infinite combinations only works so long as nobody is severely different in terms of their raw capabilities. Whenever aliens exceed in one area (like Vulcan intelligence or strength) they fall short in some other area (creative thinking, interpersonal diplomacy). Thus there are differences, but everybody's somewhat balanced.  


That goes out the window if you have a single crew member with a 1 trillion IQ who can solve all of your problems. It's like S4E19 of TNG, ""The Nth Degree"". Barclay interfaces directly with the ship computer and in doing so expands his capabilities so far beyond all other crew that there was no way the writers would just let him stay like that. It would be like Roger Penrose trying to integrate himself into beaver society, stripping down, helping them move mud &amp; sticks to build a dam.  


I think the root of this was in Gene Roddenberry's aversion to human improvement. We see it in the Federation's prohibition against genetic engineering, slowing aging, cybernetic transhumanism (except where restorative, as with Geordi) and in this case aversion even to AI outgrowing humans. Everything is fine so long as it remains in the narrow little range where everybody can serve aboard starships together.   


To me that's contrived &amp; small minded. It ironically smells to me like jealousy &amp; fear of difference. Star Trek is supposed to philosophically promote the acceptance of differences but it only does so to a point, because too much difference breaks the paradigm."

With their level of technology and the nanotechnology they are supposedly capable of utilizing, I would think they should look more impressive.  Maybe Terminators (particularly the Liquid metal ones) meet Robocop or something that looks more impressive."
1,"I'd like to ask questions largely in regards to the number of ships and men Star Fleet has. The only concrete number I've found is that they had roughly 7,000 active ships. Is there an idea of the average number of men per ship?  
  
I also understand that Star Fleet built mostly exploration vessels, but had a few specially-made war ships. Is there any information on those? I think one was the Phoenix, and another was featured in DS9, although I can't recall the name right now.  
  
Did Starfleet have actual armed soldiers, compared to the redshirt Ensigns you see in the shows? How about one-man fighting ships?

1,"Mount, Romajin, and Peck were a given from the get go. The show was announced as being in development some time ago, and I suspect was in development a good time before it was officially announced.

Filming is now imminent and would have likely begun already were it not for COVID...and yet all we know are three actors as three chracters that we've already seen them play. Now, admittedly my memory is a little rusty when it comes to character/casting announcements from previous series/seasons but it feels like compared to those we should know a great deal more at this stage in the game.

There is a post on the front page about potential for Scotty and I've seen similar speculation regarding the return/recasting of legacy characters. It just seems strange to me that despite how close we are to filming we don't even know more. I would have a cast list, crew names, or both at this point. If nothing official, I would have at least expected leaks or unconfirmed but likely rumors.

So am I way off base in my thinking timeline wise? Are they purposefully holding things back till late in the game? If so, why? Avoid backlash? Surprise fans? Some kind of ""event"" announcement? Perhaps there isn't much to say and it will be less of an ensemble than 90's Trek and the remaining cast will be less important supporting characters while Pike, Spock, and Number One will mirror the Kirk, Spock, McCoy leading trio. Either way, as much fun as speculating is I think the time is right to know more.

In any event if the casting/portrayls of new or returning characters are as good as Pike, Number One, and Spock I'd happily wait to the day of the premiere to find out who else were getting. They are all so damn good."
1,Were the Dominion was aware of the Borg?
0,"Just rewatched TFA and I was always curious about this. It seems the straightforward interpretation is that Kylo believed, to truly be a dark sider , he had to kill his father.

But did Han know this? I felt he was taking it the opposite. That he thought Ben was saying he knew he had to disavow Snoke, but wasn't sure if he could.

I always thought if he really believed Ben was considering killing him he wouldn't have acted so trusting. 

What do you think?"
0,Does anyone know how many credits did boba fett make off of Jabbas bounty for Han Solo? It might have been stated somewhere in the special editions but to be completely honest I haven’t watched the original trilogy and paid complete attention in at least a year and a half.
0,I've had this question since I've been seeing some TCW episodes. It's supposed to be a banned move from the jedi or its only used by people who can have some power from the dark side? Is a movement all force users can do or something?
1,"I just saw the episode Homeward where Picard is completely against evacuating the people because the natural course is for them to perish.  Everyone pretty much treated Worf's brother like a criminal for saving them.  I'm trying to put this in perspective with Picard being so passionate about the Romulan rescue in Star Trek Picard.  Isnt it the natural course for the romulans playing out?

Completely different shows but I'm just curious how other viewers try to make sense of this"
0,"If you've never thought about it before or put it in perspective before, R5-D4 is actually the greatest hero of the original trilogy. 

The fate of the universe, the destruction of the death star, the fall of the empire, dare i say the rise of Skywalker, literally came down to R5 blowing a motor and Uncle Owen and Luke having to settle for R2. 

Without R5 blowing his motor who knows where R2 ends up, Luke never finds Leia's message, and we don't get everything that follows. God Bless R5! The true hero of the rebellion!"
1,"So while Star Trek as a whole is very progressive and usually tackles issues like sexism, racism, homophobia transphobia, it seems some of the producers like Rick Berman have a history of actually being sexist towards the cast members. Like Marina for instance has spoken about how she was almost fired from TNG because the producer thought there was ""one too many women"". Marina also spoke about the fact she was threatened to be fired from one of the movies because they didn't want to pay her as much as her male co-stars. Terry Farrell also has a few stories of her own with regards to Berman not wanting to pay her as much for DS9 and also bullying her on the set. Even though Gene's vision was overall progressive I've also heard he's had his sexist moments too, and it just boggles my mind how such a progressive show can have executives and higher ups who are literally sexist."
0,"So, a buddy of mine and I went to go eat and we were sitting at the bar and the bartender/waiter saw my Star Wars background on my phone and we started taking Star Wars and Mandalorian. Pretty awesome guy. So when he brought out food out he put my plate down and said “here ya go Mando!”. I looked at my plate at the food and said, “This is the Way!”. We talked some more Star Wars and then I paid using my Star Wars themed credit card, left him a tip, and donned my mask with the Rebel alliance symbol on it and left. Pretty cool experience."
1,"This movie get's a lot of hate but I think it's pretty good over all. The prequel part at the start is particularly good. The part with the Ent D is decent and it an upgrade from TNG in terms of cinematography. 

It's a good bridge between TOS and TNG, particularly using Guinan. It would have been good to have a similar movie to bridge the old and new for the current trek (which I like).

The destruction of the Ent D should have been more of a challenge but the crash was impressive - the death of kirk scene was the weakest part but overall it wasn't too bad. The first 16 mins were excellent cinematography. The rest was a good idea but not executes quite as well."
1,"So... my understanding at the end of DS9 is that he’s become (or becoming) an entity similar to the prophets, who no longer experiences time as a linear concept.

I don’t know if he would have all the power of the Prophets (or maybe he does?) but even so I don’t know whether or not they could’ve stopped the Burn. But at the very least shouldn’t he be able to see the future of the Federation and the effects, and wouldn’t The Sisko do something to warn them?"
0,"I was just watching some star wars clips on YouTube, when I thought of a new way to interpret the bring balance to the force prophecy. Spoilers below.

In Rebels, the holocrons reveal to Ezra that what he seeks to destroy the Sith is on Tatooine. He thinks it is Obi-Wan but it is really Luke. 

Anakin was originally thought to be the chosen one and some would say he still is because Luke redeemed him and he killed Sidious (and himself) thus bringing balance to the force. 

But what if you think of it this way instead....

Anakin is the force. He was born without a father, thus being the will of the force. He became unbalanced and became a sith lord. Luke redeeming him, brings him back into balance. Thus we could say, Luke brought balance to the force, the force being Anakin."
0,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is Star Wars' X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Not good, not bad. Just a character movie. Do you agree?"
0,"Imagine, an adult Jedi Grogu with Mandalorian armor. 

Pretty sick. What color is his lightsaber tho?"
0,"hi everyone.

watched all of the movies and just watched the Mandalorian.

I've heard that there are many books that flesh out the lore and thought this would be a good place to ask... where do I start?  what order do I read them? Which are the best?"
1,"With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censored, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied – chains us all irrevocably. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all damaged."
1,"Sounds weird but Im sure I cant be the only person who wants this.

&amp;#x200B;

Jordi (Possibly with O'Brien) singing a parody of grease lighting (Grease) about the enterprise.

Data signing if I only had a heart (Wizard of Oz)

Worf singing a training montage e.g Ill make a man out of you (Mulan) probably parodied e.g Ill make a Klingon of you

Whole cast sing A whole new world (Aladdin)&gt;! (possibly parodied to a whole new quadrant (gamma quadrant) using DS9 cast)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously would need more but I would 100% watch that, probably missing some but I am yet to watch: Voyager, Enterprise, Piccard, Inserection, Nemisis and half of DS9 so probs havent met enough characters"
1,"Hands down Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy from Voyager. 

Nothing beats the look on Tom's face when Janeway moves The Doctor's hand down her ass during a bridge meeting when The Doctor was daydreaming or whatever."
1,"Taking out an enemy fleet in space would not be that difficult.  You would just need to monitor their communication so you know where their ships are.  Then build a bunch of long range warheads like the one in the voyager episode warhead.  These are high yeild weapons that could probably take out a starship even with it's shields up.  They are much easier to construct because they are a lot smaller then a starship.  The only thing you really need is a lot of antimatter.  And preferably a cloaking device.  Build a few thousand of them and deploy them in space and send them against an enemy fleet.

Have them move into position and when they are ready have them hit every ship in the enemy fleet simultaneously so they don't have time to adapt.  If your really desperate you could also strap nova weapons to them and have them destroy entire star systems.  But that should be only as a last resort.  These are the kinds of tactics that the maquis should have used if they expected to win.  The federation could have also used them against the dominion.

Cloaking isn't as effective with the dominion.  But these things are much smaller then a starship.  So they would be much more difficult to track.  If the federation had built and unleashed a few thousand of them they could have ended the dominion war on day one."
0,"Share your stories.  
Mine is a bit unconventional. As a kid, I would only get to play the demo version of a game. I'd play two games in particular that I really liked. One had a guy with a white shirt and a green laser sword that could use ""Force Powers"". The other one was a sequel, featuring the same guy but this time all in black and with an Orange Lightsaber. ""Imperial Troops have entered the base"" said a bunch of soldiers with weird helmets and blue shirts. Then, I'd kill a bunch of troopers in white armor. A year later I happened to have gotten a game from Lucasarts called Full Throttle. The CD had a demo of another game called ""Dark Forces"" and I once visited their website on my 56Kbps internet. There, I saw this amazing image of the same guy from the previous games, but with improved graphics. This time he had a blue Lightsaber. I was in shock. It looked great! I had to have that game, so I gathered money for a year and bought it when I was 11. The game was [Jedi Outcast](https://youtu.be/Ojh20tGNWJU) and I would play it all the time. On the level where I got my Lightsaber back, I was amazed by the soundtrack, Binary Sunset and The Force Theme started playing - I didn't know their names back then - and that instantly took me to the realm of Classical Music.  


Then one day I occasionally turned on the TV and there was this insufferable guy inside a ship having a ""romantic"" scene with some big mouthed woman with braided hair saying something like ""there aren't enough scoundrels in your life"" and I just turned off the TV thinking that movie was some annoying garbage. Then I bought the DVDs and to this day Han Solo is one of the characters I dislike the most in all Star Wars."
1,"I haven't seen this mentioned at all here but I stumbled on these links talking about a return for Archer. The first link doesn't really make much sense in terms of how they'd bring him back in a way that fits the stories that have happened in universe but still, I'd love to see him back again. Enterprise gets a lot of flack when compared to other series (especially for the theme song which to me is unrelated to the merits, good or bad, of the actual series) but I think the series is quite underrated and simultaneously had a lot more to give in terms of what parts of the Trek universe to explore. Anyway, I'd love for this to happen!

0,"This will haunt me day and night if I do not find the name of this character from the opening battle of A New Hope. If they had a name for the man that was fighting on the battle of Endor before they retconned it with Rex, they must have a name for this brave sir. If he has no name I would like for him to be named Cleff McGroodles in canon.

1,Not trying to stir any pot just genuinely curious.  Maybe it was just never addressed.
1,"So does anyone remember a, what I am assuming was fan made star trek game on the browser running in atleast mid to late 2000s. It was a giant grid based game where you would colonize planets and build ships and such. It was fully online so you could interact with other people. Normal players would get non ST ships they could build but certain players were each ST faction. I cant for the life of me remember the games name."

0,"I have recently finished the clone wars tv series and have many questions. Is there some form of media that explains pre Phantom Menace or some spin off that explains Darth Bane? Honestly, just looking for more lore or comics or what have you. 

Any recommendations are welcome!"
0,"So if I were put in charge of this 'rock' and try to make it a half  way decent character.....hmmm....some sort of symbiotic moss or a  bacteria colony. A microscopic organism that lives within the pours and  colonize the rock, like an ant colony is what I'm picturing. So the Rock  itself is not alive but is so infused with the organism that the common  people really do believe the rocks are alive. When Jedi sense the life and force flowing through the colony, they did  make initial investigations into the ""living rocks"" and just  misunderstood what they felt. To distinguish them from the Borg, though  all I know is what you just told me. I've heard of them but never in any  detail, I have zero interest in Star Trek. Anyway, to differentiate the  two species, the ""microscopic colony"" I'll call it - basing the idea on  the human microbiom, the helpful bacteria not only in our gut/stomach  to help us digest, but all throughout us. I've just learned about it in  some detail and it's insanely fascinating. 

So anyway, These rocks are the perfect environment for the micro  colony to thrive. Since this species is force sensitive as well, each  colony...fuck do you know how hard it is to fuckin concentrate when your  kite high and ADD prone...anyway I digress. Each rock has it's own  colony and each colony works as a single unit and ""develops"" an  indvidual personality or at least a basic communication with other  species as well, just depends on the intelligence scale you want their  base to be. So, to throw ""the force has a seance of humor"" in, which I  could respect if they gave a half ass chance of doing it well. Not only  are these writers idiots, they have all the creative spark of a newborn  shitting itself for the first time. Now what was I saying.

Ah yea, if you want to have some actual fun with the force, then when  the first micro colonies became sentient each ""rock"" could communicate  and possibly have some basic interaction with eachother, developing  their own ""culture"" &lt;---- how many bacteria culture and human culture  puns and jokes can you make from this...this could be pretty good.  Anywho, once this species comes in contact with another force sensitive  that could communicate with them, and just for simplistic sake (it was a  super woke nonbinary LGBTQJHVCKLGTHMKIUGTFDTJHM+ Jedi woman, and her  special partner,  who was also the top Jedi scientist and who just  happens to specialize in this relevant field, whatever it may be.  She/They/It starts to communicate with these rocks and the couple start  calling them living rocks. The micro colonies understand that a  miscommunication had been made, one was about to correct the Super  Science Couple but then another, more misctvious colony quickly stops  the other, in their own way as not to alert the outsiders.  ""Wait, let them think we are just rocks who can ""use the force"" somehow,  not only will it keep us more secret and safe, it's so stupid it's  funny. Let see if the rest of these creatures fall for it. If they  do....what happens if we can find new hosts who are also force  sensitive? What if we can take them over?

Not only can you just have an entire species play a huge joke on the  majority of the universe, There will be some who will know the colony's  for what they are right away. You can also plant the seed of some Sith  ideas of a bacteria dominating Jedi, taking over their bodies, and  combining both the colonies ablities but also the Jedis and enhancing  them past the sum of their whole. You could make some real fucking  monsters out of the most peaceful or influential Jedi and make one of  the brightest lights of their time, into a being of terror."

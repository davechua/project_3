    "# Project 3: Web APIs & NLP\n",
    "--- \n",
    "## Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "---\n",
    "As part of the marketing team for the television series, Star Trek: Lower Decks which is due to release on August 12, 2021, the stakeholders have instructed our team to conduct a NLP research on Star Trek and our competitor, Star Wars using Reddit. As we will be working with various Search Engines to publish our advertisements, this research seeks to come out with a classification model for a more effective advertising campaigns for Star Trek. Besides the classification model, this research will also address the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify some top authors in the community for potential collaboration in the marketing campaigns.\n",
    "- Identify some top common words to have a quick pilot test on the marketing campaign such as hashtags in instagram.\n",
    "- Provide a general sentiment analysis on the community as compared to our competitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Part 1: Data Collection` of the project, we will come out with a proper Data Collection method that mainly performs the following:\n",
    "- Create a function using the Pushshift's API to search for all publicly availble *submissions* on reddit.\n",
    "    - It should allow the user to choose the subreddits\n",
    "    - It should only return certain fields\n",
    "    - It should exclude posts that are empty, deleted, or removed\n",
    "    - It should allow user to input the number of posts needed\n",
    "    - It should be able to extract the data in single run and handle errors from scrapping.\n",
    "- Focus on the epoch time, so that we do not need to rescrap data. \n",
    "- Export the dataframes for each subreddits into csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Part 2: Data Cleaning and EDA` of the project, we will perform the following:\n",
    "- Identify missing values if any\n",
    "- Identify Outliers\n",
    "- Explore and describe some distributions\n",
    "- Explore on the summary statistics.\n",
    "- Identify the top authors in the community that are also active\n",
    "- Identify the top common words\n",
    "- Provide a general sentiments on the community\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Part 3: Preprocessing and Modeling` of the project, we will perform the following:\n",
    "- Preprocessing\n",
    "    - Define a function for preprocessing\n",
    "        - Remove Identified Words\n",
    "        - Remove Special Characters\n",
    "        - Stemming and Lemmanize the subreddit posts.\n",
    "    - Convert our subreddits post into a matrix representation\n",
    "        - CountVectorizer\n",
    "        - TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "- Modeling\n",
    "    - Split the data into training and testing for validation\n",
    "    - Baseline Accuracy Score\n",
    "    - Multinomial Naïve Bayes\n",
    "    - RandomForest\n",
    "    - GridSearchCV for hyperpameters\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "    - Baseline Score\n",
    "    - Evaluate based on **Accuracy**\n",
    "        - We are more interested in getting our model predicting correctly.\n",
    "        - There is no harm on getting some False Positives or False Negative (especially False Positive)\n",
    "            - If we get False Positive (type I error), i.e. We guess that it is Star Trek, but it is in fact Star Wars.\n",
    "                - In this case, we have reached out to people who are in fact looking for Star Wars info.\n",
    "            - If we get False Negative (type II error) i.e. We guess that it is Star Wars, but it is in fact Star Trek.\n",
    "                - In this case, we might have missed some marketing opportunity with the person as he is looking for info related to Star Trek, but we detected it as Star Wars.\n",
    "                    - We can also look out for `Sensitivity` (TP/TP+FN), a high Sensitivity means a low FN.\n",
    "    - Choose the \"Best\" model and offer reasoning\n",
    "        - The best model would be by `Accuracy` and taking into account of `Sensitivity`\n",
    "    - Interpret the results.\n",
    "- Conclusion\n",
    "- Recommendation\n",
    "    - We could identify more different subreddits, and label these as binary classification of 0. \n",
    "    - As image posts were not taken into account, this could be tapped on given that our current generation might prefer to post memes instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Data Collection\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this jupyter notebook, the main focus is to smoothen the data collection of the raw data (posts) from reddit using Pushshift's API. Below are some highlights in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function for data collection using the Pushshift's API to search for all publicly available *submissions* on reddit:\n",
    "    - API: `https://api.pushshift.io/`\n",
    "    - Submission : `/reddit/search/submission/`\n",
    "    - URL: `https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The 2 subreddits for this project are:\n",
    "    - Star Trek: `/r/startrek`\n",
    "    - Star Wars: `/r/starwars`\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Identify the key fields, parameters that are needed for our analysis and project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Focus on the Epoch timestamp so that we do not need to re-scrap data for the same timestamp (or same timeframe), and hence improve on the efficiency. With the file naming format we would be able to retrieve additional data (non-duplicates) in the future if we want more by using the parameters `before` and `after`.\n",
    "    - before: return results before this date by using the epoch timestamp, `earliest_epoch`\n",
    "        - earliest_epoch: the minimum `created_utc` from the respective dataframe\n",
    "    - after: return results after this date by using the epoch timestamp, `latest_epoch`\n",
    "        - latest_epoch: the maximum `created_utc` from the respective dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Export the dataframe for each subreddit into csv file in the following file naming format with 3 sections accordingly\n",
    "    - `earliest_epoch_subreddit_latest_epoch`\n",
    "        - earliest_epoch\n",
    "        - subreddit\n",
    "        - latest_epoch\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Objective of the notebook:\n",
    "Below is the thinking process outlined by the stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To gather sufficient data for our research.\n",
    "    - There are a total of 4,000 posts collected, 2,000 posts from each subreddits. \n",
    "    - Posts that are blank, removed, or deleted are not in the dataset collected.\n",
    "- To streamline the data collected.\n",
    "    - Technically in our NLP project, we only need 2 fields, \n",
    "        - target variable, y: the classifications, (aka `subreddit`), startrek = 1, starwars = 0\n",
    "            - independent variable, X: the posts (aka `selftext`)\n",
    "    - However, in our preliminary data exploration, below are additional fields that we would collect for a better understanding of the posts in each subreddits.\n",
    "        - `id`: to check if there are duplicates\n",
    "        - `author`: to check on the authors that have more posts\n",
    "        - `title`: to potentially used it\n",
    "        - `score`: to understand more in the EDA. It is the score of upvotes minus downvotes.\n",
    "        - `num_comments`: to understand more in the EDA. It is the number of comments for the post.\n",
    "        - `created_utc`: the epoch time for easier data extraction in the future\n",
    "- To have a semi-automated way of collecting data as the research still requires some human touch.\n",
    "    - A generic function was created to have a systematic and smoother data collection from reddit.\n",
    "- It should be able to extract the data in single run and handle errors from scrapping.\n",
    "    - A random time in seconds between 20s and 35s was placed in the function to ensure that the server does not receive requests in either a short interval or a fixed interval.\n",
